Grant Electroconvulsive therapy Definition Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat- ment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefully controlled amount of electricity is introduced into the brain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction with anesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces a mild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in the treatment of severe depression, and provides the most rapid relief currently available for this illness. Purpose The purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses such as severe depression, mania, and schizophrenia. ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement because they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat or drink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, or present some other danger to themselves. Antidepressant medications, while effective in many cases, may take two to six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychotic medications used to treat mania and schizophrenia have many uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side effects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel- op allergiesand therefore are unable to take their medicine. Precautions The most common risks associated with ECT are disturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bones occur very rarely. Description The treatment of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy was introduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerletti and Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con- vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since, according to their obervations, this disease rarely occurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. They concluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi- cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illness could be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari- ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their patients died or suffered severe injuries because the strength of the convulsions could not be well controlled. Electroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro- versial of all procedures used to treat mental illness. When it was first introduced, many people were fright- ened simply because it was called \u201cshock treatment.\u201d Many assumed the procedure would be painful, others thought it was a form of electrocution, and still others believed it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately, unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and movies added to these fears. Indeed, in those early years, patients and families were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this or other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result, patients had violent seizures, and even though they did not remember them, the procedure itself was frightening. The way these treatments are given today is very dif- ferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently, ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen, suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to deal with the rare emergency. The treatment is carried out as follows: approxi- mately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time, the patient may receive an injection of a medication (such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas- ing too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient is placed on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat- ically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon- itor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol- lowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes all of the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, and the risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated. When the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air- way is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec- trodes are placed on the sides of the head in the temple areas. An electric current is passed through the brain by means of a machine specifically designed for this pur- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1149 Electroconvulsive therapy",

Purpose While the implantation of electrodes in the brain is used to treat or diagnose several disorders, the term ESB is limited here to the treatment of tremors, and as a pain management tool for patients suffering from back prob- lems and other chronic injuries and illnesses. Precautions An ESB tremor control device, used in treating Parkinson patients, may interfere with or be affected by cardiac pacemakers and other medical equipment. As a result, patients with other implanted medical equipment may not be good candidates for the therapy. Description Electrical stimulation of the brain, or deep brain stimulation, is effective in treating tremors in up to 88% of Parkinson disease patients. An electrode is implanted into the thalamus (part of the brain) of the patient, and attached to an electric pulse generator via an extension wire. The pulse generator is implanted into the patient\u2019s pectoral, or chest area, and the extension wire is tunneled under the skin. The pulse generator sends out intermit- tent electrical stimulation to the electrode in the thala- mus, which inhibits or partially relieves the tremor. The generator can be turned on and off with a magnet, and needs to be replaced every three to five years. Similar methods have been used to treat chronic pain that responded unfavorably to conventional therapies.

Patients with failed back syndrome, trigeminal neuropathy (pertaining to the fifth cranial nerve), and peripheral neuropathy fared well for pain control with this treatment, while patients with spinal cord injury and postherpetic neuralagia (pain along the nerves fol- lowing herpes) did poorly. Preparation The patient should be free of any type of infection before undergoing an ESB procedure. He or she may be advised to discontinue any medication for a prescribed period of time before surgery. Aftercare After neurosurgery, patients should undergo regular head dressing changes, minimize exposure to others, and practice good personal hygiene in order to prevent a brain infection. The head may also be kept elevated for a prescribed period of time in order to decrease swelling of the brain. Risks The implantation of electrodes into the brain carries risks of hemorrhage, infarction, infection, and cerebral edema. These complications could cause irreversible neurological damage. Patients with an implanted ESB tremor control device may experience headaches, disequilibrium (a dis- turbance of the sense of balance), burning or tingling of the skin, or partial paralysis. Normal results ESB is effective in pain control for specific condi- tions. It can provide long-term pain relief with few side effects or complications. For the control of tremors a deep brain stimulator does provide some relief. It is recommended for patients with tremors severe enough to affect their quality of life.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrocardiography Definition Electrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva- sive procedure for recording electrical changes in the heart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate to the electrical impulses which occur during each beat of the heart. The results are printed on paper or displayed on a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P, Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num- ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present. Purpose Electrocardiography is a starting point for detecting many cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physical examinations and for monitoring the patient\u2019s condition during and after surgery, as well as during intensive care. It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Precautions No special precautions are required. Description The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec- trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif- ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the electrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be employed. Muscle movement may interfere with the recording, which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases where rhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, the patient may wear a small Holter monitor in order to record continuously over a 24-hour period; this is known as ambulatory monitoring. Preparation The skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact at the electrode positions. Aftercare To avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to obtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor- oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes. Risks No complications from this procedure have been observed. Normal results When the heart is operating normally, each part con- tracts in a specific order.

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries.

Catatonic excitement, or excessive movement, is associated with violent behavior directed toward oneself or others. Features of catatonia may also be seen in Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) which is an uncommon (but potentially lethal) reaction to some medications used to treat major mental illnesses. NMS is considered a medical emergency since 25% of untreated cases result in death. Catatonia can also be present in individuals suffering from a number of other physical and emotional conditions such as drug intoxication, depression, and schizophrenia. It is most commonly associated with mood disorders. Description In catatonic stupor, motor activity may be reduced to zero. Individuals avoid bathing and grooming, make little or no eye contact with others, may be mute and rigid, and initiate no social behaviors. In catatonic excitement the individual is extremely hyperactive although the activity seems to have no purpose. Violence toward him/herself or others may also be seen. NMS is observed as a dangerous side effect associat- ed with certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs such as haloperidol (Haldol). It comes on suddenly and is char- acterized by stiffening of the muscles, fever, confusion and heavy sweating. Catatonia can also be categorized as intrinsic or extrinsic. If the condition has an identifiable cause, it is designated as extrinsic. If no cause can be determined following physical examination, laboratory testing, and history taking, the illness is considered to be intrinsic. Causes and symptoms The causes of catatonia are largely unknown although research indicates that brain structure and func- tion are altered in this condition. While this and other information point to a physical cause, none has yet been proven. A variety of medical conditions also may lead to catatonia including head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis, and certain metabolic disorders. NMS is an adverse side effect of certain antipsychotic drugs. A variety of symptoms are associated with catatonia. Among the more common are echopraxia (imitation of the gestures of others) and echolalia (parrot-like repeti- tion of words spoken by others). Other signs and symp- toms include violence directed toward him/herself, the assumption of inappropriate posture, selective mutism, negativism, facial grimaces, and animal-like noises.

The individual may become dehydrated and malnourished because food and liquids are refused. In extreme situations such individuals must be fed through a tube. Catatonic excitement is characterized by hyperactivity and violence; the individual may harm him/herself or oth- ers. On rare occasions,isolationor restraint may be needed to ensure the individual\u2019s safety and the safety of others. Diagnosis Recognition of catatonia is made on the basis of specif- ic movement symptoms. These include odd ways of walk- ing such as walking on tiptoes or ritualistic pacing, and rarely, hopping and skipping. Repetitive odd movements of the fingers or hands, as well as imitating the speech or movements of others also may indicate that catatonia is pre- sent.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS) such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to avoid potentially serious hypertensive side effects. Heterocyclics include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tra- zodone (Desyrel). Bupropion should not be prescribed to patients with a seizure disorder. Side effects of the drug may include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, low blood pressure, and insomnia. Because trazodone has a sedative effect, it is useful in treating depressed patients with insom- nia. Other possible side effects of trazodone include dry mouth, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and headache. Psychosocial therapy Psychotherapy explores an individual\u2019s life to bring to light possible contributing causes of the present depression. During treatment, the therapist helps the patient to become self-aware of his or her thinking pat- terns and how they came to be. There are several differ- ent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the common goal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv- ing and coping skills. Cognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the patient\u2019s faulty thinking is causing the current depression and focuses on changing the depressed patient\u2019s thought patterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patient identify negative or distorted thought patterns and the emotions and behavior that accompany them, and then retrains the depressed individual to recognize the think- ing and react differently to it. Electroconvulsant therapy ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy , is usually employed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatment options have been explored. However, it is sometimes used early in treatment when severe depression is present and the patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient is becoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic. The treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses that move into the brain through electrodes on the patient\u2019s head. ECT is given under general anesthesia and patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre- vent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behind the success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed that the electrical current modifies the electrochemical processes of the brain, consequently relieving depres- sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusion are possible side effects immediately following an ECT procedure. Memory loss, typically transient, has also been reported in ECT patients. Alternative treatment St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum ) is used throughout Europe to treat depressive symptoms. Unlike traditional prescription antidepressants, this herbal anti- depressant has few reported side effects. Some users may experience high blood pressure, headaches, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting. As of early 1998, United States. clinical trials organized by the National Institute of Men- tal Health were still in the planning phase. Its efficacy in severe depression is very uncertain.

Purpose The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells from the infected person. Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies poten- tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera- tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers.

The patient is generally encouraged to walk 8 hours after surgery and is discharged from the hospital with- in three to five days, with return to work approximately four to six weeks after the procedure. Care received immediately after laparoscopic cholecys- tectomy is similar to that of any patient undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. A unique post-operative pain may be experienced in the right shoulder related to pressure from carbon dioxide used through the laparoscopic tubes. This pain may be relieved by laying on the left side with right knee and thigh drawn up to the chest. Walking will also help increase the body\u2019s reabsorption of the gas. The patient is usually discharged the day after surgery, and allowed to shower on the second postoperative day. The patient is advised to gradually resume normal activities over a three day period, while avoiding heavy lifting for about 10 days. Risks Potential problems associated with open cholecys- tectomy include respiratory problems related to location of the incision, wound infection, or abscess formation. Possible complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy include accidental puncture of the bowel or bladder and uncontrolled bleeding. Incomplete reabsorption of the carbon dioxide gas could irritate the muscles used in res- piration and cause respiratory distress. Resources BOOKS Monahan, Frances, and Marianne Neighbors.

Kathleen D. Wright, RN Cholecystitis Definition Cholecystitis refers to a painful inflammation of the gallbladder\u2019s wall. The disorder can occur a single time (acute), or can recur multiple times (chronic). Description The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ in the upper right hand corner of the abdomen. It is connected by a series of ducts (tube-like channels) to the liver, pan- creas, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine). To aid in digestion, the liver produces a substance called bile, which is passed into the gallbladder. The gallblad- der concentrates this bile, meaning that it reabsorbs some of the fluid from the bile to make it more potent. After a meal, bile is squeezed out of the gallbladder by strong muscular contractions, and passes through a duct into the duodenum. Due to the chemical makeup of bile, the con- tents of the duodenum are kept at an optimal pH level for digestion. The bile also plays an important part in allow- ing fats within the small intestine to be absorbed. Causes and symptoms In about 95% of all cases of cholecystitis, the gall- bladder contains gallstones . Gallstones are solid accu- mulations of the components of bile, particularly choles- terol, bile pigments, and calcium. These solids may occur when the components of bile are not in the correct proportion to each other. If the bile becomes overly con- centrated, or if too much of one component is present, stones may form. When these stones block the duct leav- ing the gallbladder, bile accumulates within the gallblad- der. The gallbladder continues to contract, but the bile GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2778 Cholecystitis",

While this is not usually recommended while the patient is acutely ill, patients with complications usually do require emergency surgery (immediately following diagnosis) because the death rate increases in these cases. Similarly, those patients who have cholecystitis with no gallstones have about a 50% chance of death if the gallbladder is not quickly removed. Most patients, however, do best if surgery is performed after they have been stabilized with fluids, an NG tube, and antibiotics as necessary. When this is possible, gallbladder removal is done within five to six days of diagnosis. In patients who have other serious medical problems that may increase the risks of gallblad- der removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to leave the gallbladder in place. In this case, the operation may involve removing obstructing gallstones and draining infected bile (called cholecystotomy). Both cholecystectomy and cholecystotomy may be performed via the classical open abdominal operation (laparotomy).

The laparo- scopic procedure can also be used to remove the gallblad- der through one of the small incisions. Because of the smaller incisions, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a pro- cedure that is less painful and promotes faster healing. Prognosis Hospital management of cholecystitis ends the symp- toms for about 75% of all patients. Of these patients, however, 25% will go on to have another attack of chole- cystitis within a year, and 60% will have another attack within six years. Each attack of cholecystitis increases a patient\u2019s risk of developing life-threatening complica- tions, requiring risky emergency surgery. Therefore, early removal of the gallbladder, rather than a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach, is usually recommended. Cure is complete in those patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Prevention Prevention of cholecystitis is probably best attempt- ed by maintaining a reasonably ideal weight. Some stud- ies have suggested that eating a diet high in fiber, vegeta- bles, and fruit is also protective. Resources BOOKS Greenberger, Norton J., and Kirk J.

David Kaminstein, MD Cholecystectomy Definition A cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. The two basic types of this procedure are open cholecystectomy and the laparoscopic approach. It is estimated that the laparoscopic procedure is currently used for approximately 80% of cases. Purpose A cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithia- sis and cholecystitis . In cholelithiasis, gallstones of varying shapes and sizes form from the solid components of bile. The presence of stones, often referred to as gall- bladder disease, may produce symptoms of excruciating right upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoul- der. The gallbladder may become the site of acute infec- tion and inflammation, resulting in symptoms of upper right abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. This condi- tion is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removal of the gallbladder can provide relief of these symptoms. Precautions Although the laparoscopic procedure requires general anesthesia for about the same length of time as the open procedure, laparoscopy generally produces less postoper- ative pain, and a shorter recovery period. The laparoscopic procedure would not be preferred in cases where the gall- bladder is so inflamed that it could rupture, or when adhe- sions (additional fibrous bands of tissue) are present. Description The laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the inser- tion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a camera on the end, through an approximately 1 cm incision in the abdomen, which allows visualization of the internal organs and projection of this image onto a video monitor. Three smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instru- ments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may be used for the incision and cautery (burning unwanted tis- sue to stop bleeding), in which case the procedure may be called laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the gall- bladder is removed through a surgical incision high in the right abdomen, just beneath the ribs. A drain may be insert- ed to prevent accumulation of fluid at the surgical site. Preparation As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be required to sign a consent form after the procedure is explained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibited after midnight before the procedure. Enemas may be ordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting are present, a suction tube to empty the stomach may be used, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainage catheter will also be used to decrease the risk of acciden- tal puncture of the stomach or bladder with insertion of the trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument). Aftercare Post-operative care for the patient who has had an open cholecystectomy, as with those who have had any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respi- ration and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia, and the patient\u2019s reluc- tance to breathe deeply due to the pain caused by the prox- imity of the incision to the muscles used for respiration. The patient is shown how to support the operative site when breathing deeply and coughing, and given pain medication as necessary.

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries.

Some methods are automatically work- ing every day, no matter what. These methods include Depo Provera, Norplant, the IUD, and tubal sterilization. There are many different ways to use birth control. They can be divided into several groups: \u2022 By mouth (oral)\u2014Birth control pills must be taken by mouth every day. \u2022 Injected\u2014Depo Provera is a hormonal medication that is given by injection every three months. \u2022 Implanted\u2014Norplant is a long-acting hormonal form of birth control that is implanted under the skin of the upper arm. \u2022 Vaginal\u2014Spermicides and barrier methods work in the vagina. \u2022 Intra-uterine\u2014The IUD is inserted into the uterus. \u2022 Surgical\u2014Tubal sterilization is a form of surgery. A doctor must perform the procedure in a hospital or sur- gical clinic. Many women need general anesthesia. The methods of birth control differ from each other in the timing of when they are used. Some methods of birth control must be used specifically at the time of sex- ual intercourse (condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sper- micides). All other methods of birth control must be working all the time to provide protection (hormonal methods, IUDs, tubal sterilization). Precautions There are risks associated with some forms of birth control. Some of the risks of each method are listed below: \u2022 Birth control pills\u2014The hormone (estrogen) in birth control pills can increase the risk of heart attack in women over 40 who smoke. \u2022 IUD\u2014The IUD can increase the risk of serious pelvic infection. The IUD can also injure the uterus by poking into or through the uterine wall. Surgery might be need- ed to fix this. \u2022 Tubal sterilization\u2014\u201cTying the tubes\u201d is a surgical pro- cedure and has all the risks of any other surgery, includ- ing the risks of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding. Preparation No specific preparation is needed before using con- traception. However, a woman must be sure that she is not already pregnant before using a hormonal method or having an IUD placed. Aftercare No aftercare is needed. Risks Many methods of birth control have side effects. Knowing the side effects can help a woman to determine which method of birth control is right for her. \u2022 Hormonal methods\u2014The hormones in birth control pills, Depo Provera, and Norplant can cause changes in menstrual periods, changes in mood, weight gain, acne, and headaches. In addition, it may take many months to begin ovulating again once a woman stops using Depo Provera or Norplant. \u2022 Barrier methods\u2014A woman must insert the diaphragm in just the right way to be sure that it works properly. Some women get more urinary tract infections if they use a diaphragm. This is because the diaphragm can press against the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the outside. \u2022 Spermicides\u2014Some women and men are allergic to spermicides or find them irritating to the skin. \u2022 IUD\u2014The IUD is a foreign body that stays inside the uterus, and the uterus tries to get it out. A woman may have heavier menstrual periods and more menstrual cramping with an IUD in place.

This history allows other potential prob- lems to be discounted. Treatment Treatment for cluster headaches is composed of induction, maintenance, and symptomatic therapies. The first two therapies are prophylactic treatments, geared toward preventing headaches. Symptomatic therapy is meant to stop or shorten a headache. Induction and maintenance therapies begin together. Induction therapy is intended to break the headache cycle with drugs such as corticosteroids (for example, pred- nisone) or dihydroergotamine. These drugs are not meant for long-term therapy, but rather as a jump-start for main- tenance therapy. Maintenance therapy drugs include ver- apamil, lithium carbonate, ergotamine, and methy- sergide. These drugs have long-term effectiveness, but must be taken for at least a week before a response is observed. With long-term treatment, methysergide must be stopped for one month each year to avoid dangerous side effects (formation of fibrous tissue inside the abdominal artery, lungs, and heart valves). Despite prophylactic treatment, headaches may still occur.

Surgery is a last resort for chronic cluster headaches that fail to respond to therapy. Alternative treatment Since some cluster headaches are triggered by stress, stress reduction techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and regular exercise, may be effective. Some cluster headaches may be an allergic response triggered by food or environmental substances, therefore identifying and removing the allergen(s) may be key to resolution of the problem. Histamine is another suspected trigger of cluster headaches, and this response may be controlled with vita- min C and the bioflavonoids quercetin and bromelain (pineapple enzyme). Supplementation with essential fatty acids (EFA) will help decrease any inflammatory response. Physical medicine therapies such as adjustments of the spine, craniosacral treatment, and massage at the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can clear blockages, as can traditional Chinese medical therapies including acupuncture. Homeopathic treatment can also be bene- ficial. Nervous system relaxant herbs, used singly or in combination, can allow the central nervous system to relax as well as assist in peripheral nerve response. A few herbs to consider for relaxation are valerian ( Valeriana officinalis), chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ), rosemary (Rosemarinus officinalis ), and skullcap ( Scutellaria baicalensis). Prognosis In general, drug therapy offers effective treatment.

The most com- monly known coagulation disorder is hemophilia, a con- dition in which patients bleed for long periods of time before clotting. There are other coagulation disorders with a variety of causes. Description Coagulation, or clotting, occurs as a complex process involving several components of the blood. Plas- ma, the fluid component of the blood, carries a number of proteins and coagulation factors that regulate bleed- ing. Platelets, small colorless fragments in the blood, ini- tiate contraction of damaged blood vessels so that less blood is lost. They also help plug damaged blood vessels and work with plasma to accelerate blood clotting. A dis- order affecting platelet production or one of the many steps in the entire process can disrupt clotting. Coagulation disorders arise from different causes and produce different complications. Some common coagulation disorders are: \u2022 Hemophilia, or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), an inherited coagulation disorder, affects about 20,000 Americans. This genetic disorder is carried by females but most often affects males. \u2022 Christmas disease, also known as hemophilia B or Fac- tor IX deficiency, is less common than hemophilia A with similar in symptoms. \u2022 Disseminated intravascular coagulation disorder, also known as consumption coagulopathy, occurs as a result of other diseases and conditions. This disease acceler- ates clotting, which can actually cause hemorrhage. \u2022 Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of coagulation disorder. It is characterized by a lack of cir- culating platelets in the blood. This disease also includes idiopathic thrombocytopenia. \u2022 V on Willebrand\u2019s disease is a hereditary disorder with prolonged bleeding time due to a clotting factor defi- ciency and impaired platelet function. It is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder. \u2022 Hypoprothrombinemia is a congenital deficiency of clotting factors that can lead to hemorrhage. \u2022 Other coagulation disorders include Factor XI deficien- cy, also known as hemophilia C, and Factor VII defi- ciency. Hemophilia C afflicts one in 100,000 people and is the second most common bleeding disorder among women. Factor VII is also called serum pro- thrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA) deficiency. One in 500,000 people may be afflicted with this disor- der that is often diagnosed in newborns because of bleeding into the brain as a result of traumatic delivery. Causes and symptoms Some coagulation disorders present symptoms such as severe bruising. Others will show no apparent symp- toms, but carry the threat of severe internal bleeding. Hemophilia Because of its hereditary nature, hemophilia A may be suspected before symptoms occur. Some signs of hemophilia A are numerous large, deep bruises and pain and swelling of joints caused by internal bleeding. Patients with hemophilia do not bleed faster, just longer. A person with mild hemophilia may first discover the disorder with prolonged bleeding following a surgical procedure.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD Cyclobenzaprine see Muscle relaxants Cyclophospha see Anticancer drugs Cyclospora infection see Cyclosporiasis Cyclosporiasis Definition Cyclosporiasis refers to infection by the spore-form- ing protozoan known as Cyclospora . Protozoa are a group of parasites that infect the human intestine. Para- sites are organisms that live in another body, called the host, and get food and liquids from that host. This para- site is a member of the group of protozoa known as coc- cidia, to which Cryptosporidia also belongs. This group of parasites infects the human intestine, and causes chronic recurrent infections in those with altered immu- nity or AIDS. Even in people with normal immune func- tion, Cyclopsora can cause prolonged bouts of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Description Until recently, Cyclospora was considered to be a form of algae. The parasite causes a common form of waterborne infectious diarrhea throughout the world. Just how the parasite gets into water sources is not yet clear. It is known that ingestion of small cysts in contaminated water leads to disease. Causes and symptoms Symptoms begin after an incubation period of about a day or so following ingestion of cysts. A brief period of flu- like illness characterized by weakness and low-grade fever is followed by watery diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and muscle aches. In some patients, symptoms may wax and wane for weeks, and there are those in whom nausea and burping may predominate. It is also believed that infection can occur without any symptoms at all. In patients with abnormal immunity (immunocom- promised patients), such as those with AIDS and cancer, prolonged diarrhea and severe weight loss often become a major problem. The bile ducts are also susceptible to infection in AIDS patients. Diagnosis The disease should be suspected in anyone with a history of prolonged or recurrent diarrhea.

          "content": "Alternative treatment Because dizziness may arise from serious conditions, it is advisable to seek medical treatment. Alternative treat- ments can often be used alongside conventional medicine without conflict. Relaxation techniques, such as yoga and massage therapythat focus on relieving tension, are pop- ularly recommended methods for reducing stress. Aro- matherapists recommend a warm bath scented with essen- tial oils of lavender, geranium, and sandalwood. Homeopathic therapies can work very effectively for dizziness, and are especially applicable when no organic cause can be identified. An osteopath or chiro- practor may suggest adjustments of the head, jaw, neck, and lower back to relieve pressure on the inner ear. Acupuncturists also offer some treatment options for acute and chronic cases of dizziness. Nutritionists may be able to offer advice and guidance in choosing dietary supplements, identifying foods to avoid, and balancing nutritional needs. KEY TERMS Acoustic neuroma\u2014A benign tumor that grows on the nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. As the tumor grows, it exerts pressure on the inner ear and causes severe vertigo. Arteriosclerosis\u2014Hardening of the arteries caused by high blood cholesterol and high blood pressure. Autonomic nervous system \u2014The part of the ner- vous system that controls involuntary functions such as breathing and heart beat. Computed tomography (CT) \u2014An imaging tech- nique in which cross-sectional x rays of the body are compiled to create a three-dimensional image of the body\u2019s internal structures. Electronystagmography\u2014A method for measuring the electricity generated by eye movements. Elec- trodes are placed on the skin around the eye and the individual is subjected to a variety of stimuli so that the quality of eye movements can be assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \u2014An imaging technique that uses a large circular magnet and radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the body. These signals are used to construct images of internal structures. Vestibular system \u2014The area of the inner ear that helps maintain balance. Prognosis Outcome depends on the cause of dizziness. Control- ling or curing the underlying factors usually relieves dizzi- ness. In some cases, dizziness disappears without treat- ment. In a few cases, dizziness can become a permanent disabling condition and a person\u2019s options are limited. Prevention Most people learn through experience that certain activities will make them dizzy and they learn to avoid them. For example, if reading in a car produces motion sickness, an individual leaves reading materials for after the trip. Changes to the diet can also cut down on episodes of dizziness in susceptible people. Relaxation techniques can help ward off tension and anxiety that can cause dizziness. These techniques can help minimize or even prevent dizziness for people with chronic diseases. For example, persons with M\u00e9ni\u00e9re\u2019s disease may avoid episodes of vertigo by leaving salt, alcohol, and caffeine out of their diets. Reducing blood cholesterol can help diminish arte- riosclerosis and indirectly treat dizziness. Some cases of dizziness cannot be prevented. Acoustic neuromas, for example, are not predictable or preventable. When the underlying cause of dizziness can- not be discovered, it may be difficult to recommend pre- ventive measures. Alternative approaches designed to rebalance the body\u2019s energy flow, such as acupuncture and constitutional homeopathy, may be helpful in cases where the cause of dizziness cannot be pinpointed.

          "content": "cancer has to be weighed against the side effects of the treatment. If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure is not possible, then the treatment should be aimed at relieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for as long as possible. Cancer treatment can take many different forms, and it is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci- sion on which type of treatment is the most appropriate depends on the type and location of cancer, the extent to which it has already spread, the patient\u2019s age, sex, gener- al health status and personal treatment preferences. The major types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo- therapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone- marrow transplantation. Surgery Surgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the most frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec- tive when a cancer is small and confined to one area of the body. Surgery can be used for many purposes. \u2022 Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves removal of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical- ly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area. Along with the cancer, some part of the normal sur- rounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreads via the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes may be examined and sometimes they are removed as well. \u2022 Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery involves removal of an abnormal looking area that is likely to become malignant over time. For example, 40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer- ative colitis, ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than live with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo- ple may choose to have their colons removed and reduce the risk significantly. \u2022 Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag- nosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can be performed by inserting a needle through the skin. How- ever, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissue sample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation. \u2022 Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible, and then treats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo- therapy or both. \u2022 Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not the cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large or has spread so much that removing the entire tumor is not an option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may be so large that it may press on and block a portion of the intestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain and vomiting. \u201cDebulking surgery\u201d may remove a part of the blockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that are dependent on hormones, removal of the organs that secrete the hormones is an option. For example, in prostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi- cles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a man may undergo an \u201corchiectomy\u201d (removal of testi- cles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in a type of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) will stop the synthesis of hormones from the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer. Radiation Radiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone in cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More often, it is used in conjunction with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter- nal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at the tumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (also known as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in the form of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous site by means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con- tainer.

Cluster headache Definition Cluster headaches are characterized by an intense one-sided pain centered by the eye or temple. The pain lasts for one to two hours on average and may recur sev- eral times in a day. Description Cluster headaches have been known as histamine headaches, red migraines, and Horton\u2019s disease, among others. The constant factor is the pain, which transcends by far the distress of the more common tension-type headache or even that of a migraine headache. Cluster headaches afflict less than 0.5% of the popu- lation and predominantly affect men; approximately 80% of sufferers are male. Onset typically occurs in the late 20s, but there is no absolute age restriction. Approximate- ly 80% of cluster headaches are classified as episodic; the remaining 20% are considered chronic. Both display the same symptoms. However, episodic cluster headaches occur during one- to five-month periods followed by six- to 24-month attack-free, or remission, periods. There is no such reprieve for chronic cluster headache sufferers. Causes and symptoms Biochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes induce cluster headaches, but why these changes occur remains unclear. Episodic cluster headaches seem to be linked to changes in day length, possibly signaling a con- nection to the so-called biological clock. Alcohol, tobac- co, histamine, or stress can trigger cluster headaches. Decreased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can also act as a trigger, particularly during the night when an indi- vidual is sleeping. Interestingly, the triggers do not cause cluster headaches during remission periods. The primary cluster headache symptom is excruciat- ing one-sided head pain centered behind an eye or near the temple. This pain may radiate outward from the ini- tial focus and encompass the mouth and teeth. For this reason, some cluster headache sufferers may mistakenly attribute their pain to a dental problem. Secondary symp- toms, occurring on the same side as the pain, include eye tearing, nasal congestion followed by a runny nose, pupil contraction, and facial drooping or flushing. Diagnosis Cluster headache symptoms guide the diagnosis. A medical examination includes recording headache GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2824 Cluster headache",

          "content": "Alternative treatment Alternative treatment for cystitis may emphasize elim- inating all sugar from the diet and drinking lots of water. Drinking unsweetened cranberry juice not only adds fluid, but is also thought to help prevent cystitis by making it more difficult for bacteria to cling to the bladder wall. A variety of herbal therapies are also recommended. General- ly, the recommended herbs are antimicrobials, such as gar- lic (Allium sativum), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), and bearberry ( Arctostaphylos uva-ursi ), and/or demul- cents that soothe and coat the urinary tract, including corn silk and marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis). Homeopathic medicine can also be effective in treat- ing cystitis. Choosing the correct remedy based on the individual\u2019s symptoms is always key to the success of this type of treatment. Acupuncture and Chinese tradi- tional herbal medicine can also be helpful in treating acute and chronic cases of cystitis. Prognosis Females The prognosis for recovery from uncomplicated cys- titis is excellent. Males The prognosis for recovery from uncomplicated UTIs is excellent; however, complicated UTIs in males are difficult to treat because they often involve bacteria that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Prevention Females Women with two or more UTIs within a six-month period are sometimes given prophylactic treatment, usu- ally nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim for three to six months. In some cases the patient is advised to take an antibiotic tablet following sexual intercourse. Other preventive measures for women include: \u2022 drinking large amounts of fluid \u2022 voiding frequently, particularly after intercourse \u2022 proper cleansing of the area around the urethra Males The primary preventive measure for males is prompt treatment of prostate infections. Chronic prostatitis may go unnoticed, but can trigger recurrent UTIs. In addition, males who require temporary catheterization following surgery can be given antibiotics to lower the risk of UTIs.

Frey Cystometry Definition Cystometry is a test of bladder function in which pressure and volume of fluid in the bladder is measured during filling, storage, and voiding. Purpose The urinary bladder stores urine produced by the kid- neys. The main muscle of the bladder wall, the detrusor, relaxes to allow expansion of the bladder during filling. The urethra, the tube through which urine exits, is held closed by a ring of muscle, known as the urethral sphinc- ter. As volume increases, stretching of the detrusor and pressure on the sphincter sends signals to the brain, indi- cating the need for urination, or voiding. V oluntary relax- ation of the sphincter and automatic contractions of the detrusor allow successful and virtually complete voiding. A cystometry study is performed to diagnose prob- lems with urination, including incontinence, urinary retention, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Urinary difficulties may occur because of weak or hyperactive sphincter or detrusor, or incoordination of their two GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2994 Cystometry",

Tish Davidson Cholestasis Definition Cholestasis is a condition caused by rapidly devel- oping (acute) or long-term (chronic) interruption in the excretion of bile (a digestive fluid that helps the body process fat). The term is taken from the Greek chole, bile, and stasis, standing still. Description Cholestasis is caused by obstruction within the liver (intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic). The obstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment bilirubin, and fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood stream instead of being eliminated normally. Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by wide- spread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such as hepatitis, that impair the body\u2019s ability to eliminate bile. Extrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect of many medications. It can also occur as a complication of surgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, or intravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can be caused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones that block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Pregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile ducts to estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the sec- ond and third trimesters of pregnancy. This condition is the second most common cause of jaundice during preg- nancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is the only symptom most women experience. Cholestasis of pregnancy tends to run in families. Symptoms usually disappear within two to four weeks after the baby\u2019s birth but may reappear if the woman becomes pregnant again. A similar condition affects some women who take birth-control pills. Symptoms disappear after the woman stops using oral contraceptives. This condition does not lead to chronic liver disease. A woman who develops cholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy or birth control hormones) has an increased risk of develop- ing cholestasis from the other. Benign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condi- tion characterized by brief, repeated episodes of itching and jaundice. Symptoms often disappear. This condition does not cause cirrhosis. Drug-induced cholestasis may be a complication of chemotherapy or other medications. The two major types of drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic injury and reactions unique to an individual (idiosyncratic reactions). In direct toxic injury, the severity of symptoms parallels the amount of medication involved. This condition: \u2022 develops a short time after treatment begins \u2022 follows a predictable pattern \u2022 usually causes liver damage Direct toxic reactions develop in 1% of all patients who take chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a tranquilizer and antinausea drug. Idiosyncratic reactions may occur at the onset of treatment or at a later time. Allergic responses are varied and are not related to the amount of medica- tion being taken. Causes and symptoms Intrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepati- tis or by medications that can produce symptoms resem- bling hepatitis. Phenothiazine-derivative drugs, including chlorpromazine, can cause sudden fever and inflamma- tion. Symptoms usually disappear after use of the drug(s) is stopped. In rare cases, a condition resembling chronic biliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized by destruction of small bile ducts) persists even after the medication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi- lar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo- lidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), and other drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be caused by alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis , cancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part of the body, and a number of rare disorders. Extrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone obstructing the passage through which bile travels from the gallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or by pancreatic cancer. Less often, the condition occurs as a result of non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures), ductal carcinoma, or disorders of the pancreas. Cholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes lit- tle, if any, inflammation. Symptoms develop gradually GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 783 Cholestasis",

          "content": "tory of hepatitis or heavy drinking, recent use of certain drugs, and symptoms like ascites (abnormal abdominal swelling) and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) suggest intrahepatic cholestasis. Pain or rigidity in the gallblad- der or pancreas suggest an extrahepatic form. Blood tests and liver function tests can reveal the pattern and extent of liver injury, indicate functional abnormalities, and establish the cause of the condition. However, most misdiagnoses occur when physicians rely more on laboratory analysis than on detailed medical his- tory and the results of a thorough physical examination. Special attention should be paid to three liver function tests. Levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can indicate whether the patient\u2019s condition is caused by an obstructive condition like cholestasis or a disease of the liver cells (hepatocellular disease) like viral hepatitis or cancer. ALP levels more than three times greater than normal indicate cholestasis. High lev- els of AST and particularly of ALT, which is found pre- dominantly in liver cells, indicate hepatocellular disease. Once the disease pattern has been established, ultra- sound may be performed to determine whether obstruc- tion of the large duct has caused widening of small ducts located close to it. Computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide more detailed information about the source of the obstruction. If these procedures that do not enter the patient\u2019s body (non-invasive procedures) do not provide the information a family physician, internist, or gastroen- terologist needs to make a diagnosis of cholestasis, one of these procedures may be performed: \u2022 direct cholangiography, an x-ray map of the bile ducts, enhanced by the use of contrast dye \u2022 percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, used to identify obstructions that impede the flow of bile from the liver to the digestive system, takes x-ray images of the bile ducts after a contrast dye has been injected by a needle passed directly into a hepatic duct \u2022 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which uses a special dye to outline the pancre- atic and common bile ducts and highlight the position of any obstruction; a special tube with a light transmit- ter is inserted into the duct and a series of x-ray images is taken A doctor who thinks a physical obstruction is responsible for progressive deterioration of a patient\u2019s condition may consider an exploratory surgical proce- dure (diagnostic laparotomy). Liver biopsy is sometimes performed if imaging tests do not indicate why a duct is enlarged, but results of a single biopsy may not represent the status of the entire organ. Treatment The goal of treatment is to eliminate or control the patient\u2019s symptoms. Discontinuing the use of certain drugs can restore normal liver function, but surgery may be needed to drain or remove obstructions or to widen affected ducts. Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), an antibacterial drug; phenobarbital, a barbiturate anticonvulsant; and other drugs are sometimes prescribed to cleanse the sys- tem and eliminate bile salts and other toxic compounds. Patients who have chronic cholestasis and have trou- ble digesting fat may have to restrict the amount of fat in their diet and take calcium and water-soluble vitamin supplements. A liver transplant may become necessary if complications occur. Prognosis Symptoms almost always disappear after the under- lying condition is controlled. Some patients who have cholestasis experience symp- toms only after infection develops, but chronic bile-duct obstruction always leads to cirrhosis. It may also cause osteoporosis(fragile bones) or osteomalacia (soft bones). Emergency care is not required unless inflammation of the bile ducts ( cholangitis ) develops. Cancer should be considered when an adult suddenly develops cholesta- sis after the age of 50. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med- icine. Philadelphia: W.

The tests include alkaline phosphatase and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \u2014An imaging technique that uses a large circular magnet and radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the body. These signals are used to construct images of internal structures. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography\u2014An x- ray examination of the bile ducts. A needle is passed through the skin (percutaneous) across or over the liver (transhepatic) and directly into a bile duct to inject a contrast dye. The dye enhances the x-ray image mapping the system of bile ducts (cholangiography). Phenothiazine-derivative drugs \u2014A large family of drugs derived from phenothiazine, a compound that in itself is too poisonous for human consump- tion. Phenothiazine derivatives include tranquiliz- ers, medications that prevent vomiting, antihista- mines, and drugs used to enhance the effectiveness of anesthesia. Ultrasonography \u2014A test using sound waves to measure blood flow. Gel is applied to a hand-held transducer that is pressed against the patient\u2019s body. Images are displayed on a monitor. Symptoms of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis include a yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice), dark urine, and pale stools. Itching over the skin may be severe if the condition is advanced. Symptoms of chronic cholestasis include: \u2022 skin discoloration \u2022 scars or skin injuries caused by scratching \u2022 bone pain \u2022 yellowish fat deposits beneath the surface of the skin (xanthoma) or around the eyes (xanthelasma) Patients with advanced cholestasis feel ill, tire easi- ly, and are often nauseated.

Infection of cysts leads to abscesses in up to 20%. \u2022 Lung cysts cause cough and chest pain. \u2022 Bone cysts cause fractures and damage to bone tissue. \u2022 Heart involvement leads to irregularities of heart beat and inflammation of the covering of the heart (peri- cardium). \u2022 Allergic reactions occur from leakage of cyst fluid that contains antigens. Itching , fever, and rashes are fre- quent, and fatal allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) have been reported. Eosinophils, which are blood cells involved in allergic reactions, are increased in many patients. Diagnosis X rays, computed tomography scans (CT scans), and ultrasound are very helpful in detecting cysts. Some cysts will develop characteristic hardening of organ tis- sues from calcium deposits (calcifications). Blood tests to detect antibodies are useful when positive, but up to 50% of patients have negative results. Examination of aspirated cyst fluid for parasites can be diagnostic, but carries the danger of a fatal allergic reaction. Treatment with anti-parasitic medications before aspiration is reported to decrease allergic complications and decrease the risk of spread during the procedure. Treatment Treatment depends on the size and location of cysts, as well as the symptoms they are producing. Surgical removal of cysts and/or surrounding tissue is the accept- ed method of treatment, but carries a risk of cyst rupture with spread or allergic reactions. Recent studies using medication alongside aspiration and drainage of cysts instead of surgery are very encouraging. The medication albenzadole can be taken before or after surgery or alone without surgery. However, its effectiveness as a single treatment is still not known. Multiple courses of medication are often necessary, with cure rates of only about 30%. Response to treat- ment is best monitored by serial CT scans or similar x- ray studies. Prevention Good hand washing, treating infected dogs, and pre- venting dogs access to slaughter houses discourage spread of the disease. Limiting the population of stray dogs has also been helpful.

David Kaminstein, MD Cholecystectomy Definition A cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. The two basic types of this procedure are open cholecystectomy and the laparoscopic approach. It is estimated that the laparoscopic procedure is currently used for approximately 80% of cases. Purpose A cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithia- sis and cholecystitis . In cholelithiasis, gallstones of varying shapes and sizes form from the solid components of bile. The presence of stones, often referred to as gall- bladder disease, may produce symptoms of excruciating right upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoul- der. The gallbladder may become the site of acute infec- tion and inflammation, resulting in symptoms of upper right abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. This condi- tion is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removal of the gallbladder can provide relief of these symptoms. Precautions Although the laparoscopic procedure requires general anesthesia for about the same length of time as the open procedure, laparoscopy generally produces less postoper- ative pain, and a shorter recovery period. The laparoscopic procedure would not be preferred in cases where the gall- bladder is so inflamed that it could rupture, or when adhe- sions (additional fibrous bands of tissue) are present. Description The laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the inser- tion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a camera on the end, through an approximately 1 cm incision in the abdomen, which allows visualization of the internal organs and projection of this image onto a video monitor. Three smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instru- ments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may be used for the incision and cautery (burning unwanted tis- sue to stop bleeding), in which case the procedure may be called laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the gall- bladder is removed through a surgical incision high in the right abdomen, just beneath the ribs. A drain may be insert- ed to prevent accumulation of fluid at the surgical site. Preparation As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be required to sign a consent form after the procedure is explained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibited after midnight before the procedure. Enemas may be ordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting are present, a suction tube to empty the stomach may be used, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainage catheter will also be used to decrease the risk of acciden- tal puncture of the stomach or bladder with insertion of the trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument). Aftercare Post-operative care for the patient who has had an open cholecystectomy, as with those who have had any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respi- ration and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia, and the patient\u2019s reluc- tance to breathe deeply due to the pain caused by the prox- imity of the incision to the muscles used for respiration. The patient is shown how to support the operative site when breathing deeply and coughing, and given pain medication as necessary.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants. However, cough KEY TERMS Antitussives\u2014Drugs used to suppress coughing. Expectorant\u2014Drug used to thin mucus.

Larynx\u2014A part of the respiratory tract between the pharynx and the trachea, having walls of cartilage and muscle and containing the vocal cords. Sputum\u2014The mixture of mucus, irritants, and other substances expelled from the lungs by coughing. medicines may be given if the patient cannot rest because of the cough or if the cough is not productive, as is the case with most coughs associated with colds or flu. The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under- lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942 Cough",

          "content": "Dehydration in children usually results from losing large amounts of fluid and not drinking enough water to replace the loss. This condition generally occurs in chil- dren who have stomach flu characterized by vomiting and diarrhea , or who can not or will not take enough fluids to compensate for excessive losses associated with fever and sweating of acute illness. An infant can become dehydrated only hours after becoming ill. Dehy- dration is a major cause of infant illness and death throughout the world. Types of dehydration Mild dehydration is the loss of no more than 5% of the body\u2019s fluid. Loss of 5\u201310% is considered moderate dehydration. Severe dehydration (loss of 10\u201315% of body fluids) is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical care. Complications of dehydration When the body\u2019s fluid supply is severely depleted, hypovolemic shock is likely to occur. This condition, which is also called physical collapse, is characterized by pale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; and shallow breathing. Blood pressure sometimes drops so low it can not be measured, and skin at the knees and elbows may become blotchy. Anxiety, restlessness, and thirst increase. After the patient\u2019s temperature reaches 107\u00b0F (41.7\u00b0C) damage to the brain and other vital organs occurs quickly. Causes and symptoms Strenuous activity, excessive sweating, high fever, and prolonged vomiting or diarrhea are common causes of dehydration. So are staying in the sun too long, not drinking enough fluids, and visiting or moving to a warm region where it doesn\u2019t often rain. Alcohol, caffeine, and diuretics or other medications that increase the amount of fluid excreted can cause dehydration. Reduced fluid intake can be a result of: \u2022 appetite loss associated with acute illness \u2022 excessive urination (polyuria) \u2022 nausea \u2022 bacterial or viral infection or inflammation of the phar- ynx (pharyngitis) \u2022 inflammation of the mouth caused by illness, infection, irritation, or vitamin deficiency (stomatitis) Other conditions that can lead to dehydration include: \u2022 disease of the adrenal glands, which regulate the body\u2019s water and salt balance and the function of many organ systems \u2022 diabetes mellitus \u2022 eating disorders \u2022 kidney disease \u2022 chronic lung disease An infant who does not wet a diaper in an eight- hour period is dehydrated. The soft spot on the baby\u2019s head (fontanel) may be depressed. Symptoms of dehy- dration at any age include cracked lips, dry or sticky mouth, lethargy, and sunken eyes. A person who is dehydrated cries without shedding tears and does not urinate very often. The skin is less elastic than it should be and is slow to return to its normal position after being pinched. Dehydration can cause confusion, constipation, dis- comfort, drowsiness, fever, and thirst. The skin turns pale and cold, the mucous membranes lining the mouth and nose lose their natural moisture. The pulse sometimes races and breathing becomes rapid. Significant fluid loss can cause serious neurological problems. Diagnosis The patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history usual- ly suggest dehydration. Physical examination may reveal shock, rapid heart rate, and/or low blood pres- sure. Laboratory tests, including blood tests (to check electrolyte levels) and urine tests (e.g., urine specific gravity and creatinine), are used to evaluate the severi- ty of the problem. Other laboratory tests may be ordered to determine the underlying condition (such as diabetes or an adrenal gland disorder) causing the dehydration. Treatment Increased fluid intake and replacement of lost elec- trolytes are usually sufficient to restore fluid balances in patients who are mildly or moderately dehydrated. For individuals who are mildly dehydrated, just drinking plain water may be all the treatment that is needed. Adults who need to replace lost electrolytes may drink sports beverages (e.g., Gatorade or Recharge) or con- sume a little additional salt. Parents should follow label instructions when giving children Pedialyte or other commercial products recommended to relieve dehydra- tion. Children who are dehydrated should receive only clear fluids for the first 24 hours. A child who is vomiting should sip one or two tea- spoons of liquid every 10 minutes.

DI is easily confused with an entirely unrelated dis- order, psychogenic polydipsia. Polydipsia refers to drinking large amounts of water. Psychogenic polydipsia is a psychiatric problem that makes a person drink huge quantities of water uncontrollably. Symptoms of DI include extreme thirst and the pro- duction of tremendous quantities of urine. Patients with DI typically drink huge amounts of water, and usually report a specific craving for cold water. When the amount of water passed in the urine exceeds the patient\u2019s ability to drink ample replacement water, the patient may begin to suffer from symptoms of dehydration . These symp- toms include weakness, fatigue, fever, low blood pres- sure, increased heart rate, dizziness , and confusion. If left untreated, the patient could lapse into unconscious- ness and die. Diagnosis Diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with sudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami- nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made up mostly of water with no solute. Examination of the blood will reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute and low in fluid volume. A water deprivation test may be performed. This test requires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient is weighed just before the test begins, and urine is collected and examined hourly. The test is stopped when: \u2022 the patient has lost more than 5% of his or her original body weight \u2022 the patient has reached certain limits of low blood pres- sure and increased heart rate \u2022 the urine is no longer changing significantly from one sample to the next in terms of solute concentration The next step of the test involves injecting a synthet- ic form of ADH, with one last urine sample examined 60 minutes later. Comparing plasma and urine osmolality allows the doctor to diagnose either central DI, nephro- genic DI, partial DI, or psychogenic polydipsia. Treatment A number of medications can be given to decrease the quantity of fluid passed out into the urine. These include vasopressin (Pitressin) injected and desmo- pressin acetate (DDA VP) inhaled through the nose. Other medications that may be given include some antidiuretic drugs (chlorpropamide, clofibrate, carbamazepine).

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD Dextromethorphan see Cough suppressants Diabetes insipidus Definition Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder that causes the patient to produce tremendous quantities of urine. The massively increased urine output is usually accompanied by intense thirst. Description The balance of fluid within the body is maintained through a number of mechanisms. One important chemi- cal involved in fluid balance is called antidiuretic hor- mone (ADH). ADH is produced by the pituitary, a small gland located at the base of the brain. In a healthy person and under normal conditions, ADH is continuously KEY TERMS Allergen\u2014Any substance that irritates people sen- sitive (allergic) to it. Allergic rhinitis \u2014Swelling and inflammation of the nasal membranes caused by sensitivity to air- borne matter like pollen or cat hair. Saline\u2014A salt solution in water. Normal saline has the same salt concentration as the body, 0.9%. Sinuses\u2014The nasal sinuses, air-filled cavities sur- rounding the eyes and nose, like the nose itself are lined with mucus-producing membranes. They provide cleansing to the nose, resonance to the voice, and structure to the face. Sinusitis\u2014Infection of the sinuses. Sleep apnea \u2014A condition in which breathing is temporarily interrupted during sleep. It leads to high blood pressure, sleepiness, and a variety of other problems. released. ADH influences the amount of fluid that the kidneys reabsorb into the circulatory system and the amount of fluid that the kidneys pass out of the body in the form of urine. Production of ADH is regulated by the osmolality of the circulating blood. Osmolality refers to the concentra- tion of dissolved chemicals (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride; together called solute) circulating in the fluid base of the blood (plasma). When there is very little fluid compared to the concentration of solute, the pitu- itary will increase ADH production. This tells the kid- neys to retain more water and to decrease the amount of urine produced. As fluid is retained, the concentration of solute will normalize. At other times, when the fluid con- tent of the blood is high in comparison to the concentra- tion of solute, ADH production will decrease. The kid- neys are then free to pass an increased amount of fluid out of the body in the urine. Again, this will allow the plasma osmolality to return to normal. Diabetes insipidus occurs when either the amount of ADH produced by the pituitary is below normal (central DI), or the kidneys\u2019 ability to respond to ADH is defective (nephrogenic DI). In either case, a person with DI will pass extraordinarily large quantities of urine, sometimes reaching 10 or more liters each day. At the same time, the patient\u2019s blood will be very highly concentrated, with low fluid volume and high concentrations of solute. DI occurs on average when a person is about 24 years old, and occurs more frequently in males than in females. Causes and symptoms DI may run in families. The cause of this type of DI is unknown. Other times, central DI can be caused by: \u2022 an injury to the head \u2022 brain surgery \u2022 cancers that have spread to the pituitary gland (most commonly occurring with breast cancer) \u2022 sarcoidosis (or other related disorders), causing destruction of the pituitary gland \u2022 any condition or illness that causes decreased oxygen delivery to the brain \u2022 the use of certain medications that decrease ADH produc- tion (like the antiseizure drug phenytoin) \u2022 the excessive use of alcohol Central DI may also occur in women who are preg- nant or have just given birth, and in patients with AIDS who have suffered certain types of brain infections.

A child who is more than one year old and who is not vomiting should take two tablespoons of liquid every 30 minutes. A baby who is being breast-fed should be given clear liquids for two consecutive feedings before breastfeeding is resumed. A bottle-fed baby should be given formula diluted to half its strength for the first 24 hours after developing symptoms of dehydration. In order to accurately calculate fluid loss, it\u2019s important to chart weight changes every day and keep a record of how many times a patient vomits or has diar- rhea. Parents should note how many times a baby\u2019s dia- per must be changed. Children and adults can gradually return to their normal diet after they have stopped vomiting and no longer have diarrhea. Bland foods should be reintro- duced first, with other foods added as the digestive sys- tem is able to tolerate them. Milk, ice cream, cheese, and butter should not be eaten until 72 hours after symp- toms have disappeared. Medical care Severe dehydration can require hospitalization and intravenous fluid replacement. If an individual\u2019s blood pressure drops enough to cause or threaten the develop- ment of shock, medical treatment is usually required. A doctor should be notified whenever an infant or child exhibits signs of dehydration or a parent is concerned that a stomach virus or other acute illness may lead to dehydration. A doctor should also be notified if: \u2022 a child less than three months old develops a fever higher than 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) \u2022 a child more than three months old develops a fever higher than 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) \u2022 symptoms of dehydration worsen \u2022 an individual urinates very sparingly or does not urinate at all during a six-hour period \u2022 dizziness, listlessness, or excessive thirst occur \u2022 a person who is dieting and using diuretics loses more than 3 lb (1.3 kg) in a day or more than 5 lb (2.3 kg) a week When treating dehydration, the underlying cause must also be addressed. For example, if dehydration is caused by vomiting or diarrhea, medications may be pre- scribed to resolve these symptoms. Patients who are dehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenal gland disorders must receive treatment for these condi- tions as well as for the resulting dehydration. Alternative treatment Gelatin water can be substituted for electrolyte- replacement solutions. It is made by diluting a 3-oz package in a quart of water or by adding one-quarter teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar to a pint of water. Prognosis Mild dehydration rarely results in complications. If the cause is eliminated and lost fluid is replaced, mild dehydration can usually be cured in 24\u201348 hours. V omiting and diarrhea that continue for several days without adequate fluid replacement can be fatal. The risk of life-threatening complications is greater for young children and the elderly. However, dehydration that is rapidly recognized and treated has a good outcome. Prevention Patients who are vomiting or who have diarrhea can prevent dehydration by drinking enough fluid for their urine to remain the color of pale straw. Ensuring that patients always drink adequate fluids during an ill- ness will help prevent dehydration. Infants and young children with diarrhea and vomiting can be given elec- trolyte solutions such as Pedialyte to help prevent dehy- dration. People who are not ill can maintain proper fluid balance by drinking several glasses of water before going outside on a hot day. It is also a good idea to avoid coffee and tea, which increase body tempera- ture and water loss. Patients should know whether any medication they are taking can cause dehydration and should get prompt medical care to correct any underlying condition that increases the risk of dehydration.

Frey Famine fever see Relapsing fever Fanconi\u2019s syndrome Definition Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor- ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc- tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal- cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the body. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth. Description Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body needs in the blood and putting what the body doesn\u2019t need into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is performed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered through a kidney structure with small holes that keep the cells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of the small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body, are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome. As a consequence, substances that are normally reabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins, water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and phosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn- drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular syndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debr\u00e9-Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi\u2019s anemia is, however, a totally different disease. Causes and symptoms Causes Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be caused by a variety of genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults. The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause in children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease, hereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome, Wilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease, vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome. Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium, lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like outdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances (like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine taken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans- plantation. Symptoms Fanconi\u2019s syndrome symptoms related directly to impaired absorption include excessive urine production and urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa- tion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu- cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and protein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels of phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively acidic blood. The most noticeable indirect consequences of impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and osteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated with bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty walking. If a person acquires Fanconi\u2019s syndrome as an adult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is accompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac- tures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and occasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of the ineffective reabsorption. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be made by urine and blood tests. It is also important to find the underlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Other symptoms specific to a particular patient will point to other useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290 Fanconi\u2019s syndrome",

Maureen Haggerty Delavirdine see Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Delayed hypersensitivity skin test Definition A delayed hypersensitivity test (DHT) is an immune function test measuring the presence of activated T cells that recognize a certain substance. Purpose The immune system protects against infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial expo- sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys- tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Both these immune agents respond when the body is reex- posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulating proteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termed an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells\u2019 respons- es occur over several days, and are thus called delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat- ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red- ness (erythema) at the injection site. A DHT is performed for one of three reasons: \u2022 To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber- culosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting into the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con- tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provoke an immune response. \u2022 To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants, such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually done by placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con- taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub- stances. \u2022 To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of the evaluation of immune system health in infection, cancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen- ing, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict survival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu- ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens used for these tests must be ones the patient has been exposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivated antigens from common infectious agents to which the patient might have been exposed, such as mumps , Candida albicans , tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a skin fungus). Precautions No special precautions are necessary for most patients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certain skin irritants should alert the clinician performing the test. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigens contain mercury, a source of irritation to some patients. Description The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in which a small amount of TB antigen is injected into the skin. The area is examined 48\u201372 hours after the injection. In the patch test, 20\u201330 adhesive patches are usually placed on the upper back. The patches are kept in place and the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches are then removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after- ward, and possibly again a day or more following that. Patch testing is usually performed following a patient complaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance. Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying the right one requires careful review of the patient\u2019s possi- ble exposure. The test of overall T cell responsiveness is per- formed with several injections. Each area injected is cir- cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the injection. Preparation No special preparation is necessary. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1019 Delayed hypersensitivity skin test",

Description Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it takes in. This condition can result from illness; a hot, dry climate; prolonged exposure to sun or high tem- peratures; not drinking enough water; and overuse of diuretics or other medications that increase urination. Dehydration can upset the delicate fluid-salt balance needed to maintain healthy cells and tissues. Water accounts for about 60% of a man\u2019s body weight. It represents about 50% of a woman\u2019s weight. Young and middle-aged adults who drink when they\u2019re thirsty do not generally have to do anything more to maintain their body\u2019s fluid balance. Children need more water because they expend more energy, but most chil- dren who drink when they are thirsty get as much water as their systems require. Age and dehydration Adults over the age of 60 who drink only when they are thirsty probably get only about 90% of the fluid they need. Developing a habit of drinking only in response to the body\u2019s thirst signals raises an older person\u2019s risk of becoming dehydrated. Seniors who have relocated to areas where the weather is warmer or dryer than the cli- mate they are accustomed to are even likelier to become dehydrated unless they make it a practice to drink even when they are not thirsty.

Description Like many other upper respiratory diseases, diphthe- ria is most likely to break out during the winter months. At one time it was a major childhood killer, but it is now rare in developed countries because of widespread immunization. Since 1988, all confirmed cases in the United States have involved visitors or immigrants. In countries that do not have routine immunization against this infection, the mortality rate varies from 1.5\u201325%. Persons who have not been immunized may get diphtheria at any age. The disease is spread most often by droplets from the coughing or sneezing of an infected person or carrier. The incubation period is two to seven days, with an average of three days. It is vital to seek medical help at once when diphtheria is suspected, because treatment requires emergency measures for adults as well as children. Causes and symptoms The symptoms of diphtheria are caused by toxins produced by the diphtheria bacillus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae (from the Greek for \u201crubber membrane\u201d). In fact, toxin production is related to infections of the bacil- lus itself with a particular bacteria virus called a phage (from bacteriophage; a virus that infects bacteria). The intoxication destroys healthy tissue in the upper area of the throat around the tonsils, or in open wounds in the skin. Fluid from the dying cells then coagulates to form the telltale gray or grayish green membrane. Inside the membrane, the bacteria produce an exotoxin, which is a poisonous secretion that causes the life-threatening symptoms of diphtheria. The exotoxin is carried through- out the body in the bloodstream, destroying healthy tis- sue in other parts of the body. The most serious complications caused by the exo- toxin are inflammations of the heart muscle ( myocardi- tis) and damage to the nervous system. The risk of seri- ous complications is increased as the time between onset of symptoms and the administration of antitoxin increas- es, and as the size of the membrane formed increases. The myocarditis may cause disturbances in the heart rhythm and may culminate in heart failure . The symp- toms of nervous system involvement can include seeing double (diplopia), painful or difficult swallowing, and slurred speech or loss of voice, which are all indications of the exotoxin\u2019s effect on nerve functions. The exotoxin may also cause severe swelling in the neck (\u201cbull neck\u201d). The signs and symptoms of diphtheria vary accord- ing to the location of the infection: Nasal Nasal diphtheria produces few symptoms other than a watery or bloody discharge. On examination, there may be a small visible membrane in the nasal passages. Nasal infection rarely causes complications by itself, but it is a public health problem because it spreads the disease more rapidly than other forms of diphtheria. Pharyngeal Pharyngeal diphtheria gets its name from the phar- ynx, which is the part of the upper throat that connects the mouth and nasal passages with the voice box. This is the most common form of diphtheria, causing the charac- teristic throat membrane. The membrane often bleeds if it is scraped or cut. It is important not to try to remove the membrane because the trauma may increase the body\u2019s absorption of the exotoxin. Other signs and symp- toms of pharyngeal diphtheria include mild sore throat, fever of 101\u2013102\u00b0F (38.3\u201338.9\u00b0C), a rapid pulse, and general body weakness. Laryngeal Laryngeal diphtheria, which involves the voice box or larynx, is the form most likely to produce serious complications. The fever is usually higher in this form of diphtheria (103\u2013104\u00b0F or 39.4\u201340\u00b0C) and the patient is very weak. Patients may have a severe cough, have diffi- culty breathing, or lose their voice completely. The development of a \u201cbull neck\u201d indicates a high level of exotoxin in the bloodstream. Obstruction of the airway may result in respiratory compromise and death. Skin This form of diphtheria, which is sometimes called cutaneous diphtheria, accounts for about 33% of diphthe- ria cases. It is found chiefly among people with poor hygiene. Any break in the skin can become infected with diphtheria.

Description The disease called discoid lupus erythematosus only affects the skin, although similar discoid skin lesions can occur in the serious disease called systemic lupus ery- thematosus (SLE). Only about 10% of all patients with DLE will go on to develop the multi-organ disease SLE. The tendency to develop DLE seems to run in fami- lies. Although men or women of any age can develop DLE, it occurs in women three times more frequently than in men. The typical DLE patient is a woman in her 30s.

          "content": "other diseases that may cause fever and sore throat, such as infectious mononucleosis , a sinus infection, or strep throat. The most important single symptom that sug- gests diphtheria is the membrane. When a patient devel- ops skin infections during an outbreak of diphtheria, the doctor will consider the possibility of cutaneous diphthe- ria and take a smear to confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory tests The diagnosis of diphtheria can be confirmed by the results of a culture obtained from the infected area. Mater- ial from the swab is put on a microscope slide and stained using a procedure called Gram\u2019s stain. The diphtheria bacillus is called Gram-positive because it holds the dye after the slide is rinsed with alcohol. Under the micro- scope, diphtheria bacilli look like beaded rod-shaped cells, grouped in patterns that resemble Chinese characters. Another laboratory test involves growing the diphtheria bacillus on a special material called Loeffler\u2019s medium. Treatment Diphtheria is a serious disease requiring hospital treatment in an intensive care unit if the patient has developed respiratory symptoms. Treatment includes a combination of medications and supportive care: Antitoxin The most important step is prompt administration of diphtheria antitoxin, without waiting for laboratory results. The antitoxin is made from horse serum and works by neutralizing any circulating exotoxin. The doc- tor must first test the patient for sensitivity to animal serum. Patients who are sensitive (about 10%) must be desensitized with diluted antitoxin, since the antitoxin is the only specific substance that will counteract diphthe- ria exotoxin. No human antitoxin is available for the treatment of diphtheria. The dose ranges from 20,000\u2013100,000 units, depending on the severity and length of time of symp- toms occurring before treatment. Diphtheria antitoxin is usually given intravenously. Antibiotics Antibiotics are given to wipe out the bacteria, to prevent the spread of the disease, and to protect the patient from developing pneumonia. They are not a sub- stitute for treatment with antitoxin. Both adults and chil- dren may be given penicillin, ampicillin, or ery- thromycin. Erythromycin appears to be more effective than penicillin in treating people who are carriers because of better penetration into the infected area. Cutaneous diphtheria is usually treated by cleansing the wound thoroughly with soap and water, and giving the patient antibiotics for 10 days. Supportive care Diphtheria patients need bed rest with intensive nursing care, including extra fluids, oxygenation, and monitoring for possible heart problems, airway blockage, or involvement of the nervous system. Patients with laryngeal diphtheria are kept in a croup tent or high- humidity environment; they may also need throat suc- tioning or emergency surgery if their airway is blocked. Patients recovering from diphtheria should rest at home for a minimum of two to three weeks, especially if they have heart complications. In addition, patients should be immunized against diphtheria after recovery, because having the disease does not always induce anti- toxin formation and protect them from reinfection. Prevention of complications Diphtheria patients who develop myocarditis may be treated with oxygen and with medications to prevent irregular heart rhythms. An artificial pacemaker may be needed. Patients with difficulty swallowing can be fed through a tube inserted into the stomach through the nose. Patients who cannot breathe are usually put on mechanical respirators. Prognosis The prognosis depends on the size and location of the membrane and on early treatment with antitoxin; the longer the delay, the higher the death rate. The most vul- nerable patients are children under age 15 and those who develop pneumonia or myocarditis. Nasal and cutaneous diphtheria are rarely fatal. Prevention Prevention of diphtheria has four aspects: Immunization Universal immunization is the most effective means of preventing diphtheria. The standard course of immu- nization for healthy children is three doses of DPT (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) preparation given between two months and six months of age, with booster doses given at 18 months and at entry into school. Adults should be immunized at 10 year intervals with Td (tetanus-diphtheria) toxoid. A toxoid is a bacterial toxin that is treated to make it harmless but still can induce immunity to the disease.

          "content": "research is needed to try to harness the benefits of inflix- imab, while avoiding the potential complications. Serious cases of malabsorption/malnutrition may need to be treated by providing nutritional supplements. These supplements must be in a form that can be absorbed from the damaged, inflamed intestine. Some patients find that certain foods are hard to digest, includ- ing milk, large quantities of fiber, and spicy foods. When patients are suffering from an obstruction, or during peri- ods of time when symptoms of the disease are at their worst, they may need to drink specially formulated, high- calorie liquid supplements. Those patients who are severely ill may need to receive their nutrition through a needle inserted in a vein (intravenously), or even by a tiny tube (a catheter) inserted directly into a major vein in the chest. A number of medications are available to help decrease the cramping and pain associated with Crohn\u2019s disease. These include loperamide, tincture of opium, and codeine. Some fiber preparations (methylcellulose or psyllium) may be helpful, although some patients do not tolerate them well. The first step in treating an obstruction involves gen- eral attempts to decrease inflammation with sul- fasalazine, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. A patient with a severe obstruction will have to stop taking all food and drink by mouth, allowing the bowel to \u201crest.\u201d Abscesses and other infections will require antibi- otics. Surgery may be required to repair an obstruction that does not resolve on its own, to remove an abscess, or to repair a fistula. Such surgery may involve the removal of a section of the intestine. In extremely severe cases of Crohn\u2019s disease that do not respond to treatment, a patient may need to have the entire large intestine removed (an operation called a colectomy). In this case, a piece of the remaining small intestine is pulled through an opening in the abdomen. This bit of intestine is fash- ioned surgically to allow a special bag to be placed over it. This bag catches the body\u2019s waste, which no longer can be passed through the large intestine and out of the anus. This opening, which will remain in place for life, is called an ileostomy. Prognosis Crohn\u2019s disease is a life-long illness. The severity of the disease can vary, and a patient can experience periods of time when the disease is not active and he or she is symptom-free. However, the complications and risks of Crohn\u2019s disease tend to increase over time. Well over 60% of all patients with Crohn\u2019s disease will require surgery, and about half of these patients will require more than one operation over time. About 5\u201310% of all Crohn\u2019s patients will die of their disease, primarily due to massive infection.

Testing for cryoglobulin is done KEY TERMS Diphtheria \u2014A serious, frequently fatal, bacterial infection that affects the respiratory tract. Vaccina- tions given in childhood have made diphtheria very rare in the United States. Epiglottitis \u2014A bacterial infection that affects the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that pre- vents food and fluid from entering the trachea. The infection causes it to become swollen, potentially blocking the airway. Other symptoms include a high fever, nonbarking cough, muffled voice, and an inability to swallow properly (possibly indicat- ed by drooling). Glucocorticoid \u2014A hormone that helps in diges- tion of carbohydrates and reduces inflammation. Larynx\u2014Commonly called the voice box, it is the area of the trachea that contains the vocal cords. Stridor \u2014The medical term used to describe the high-pitched or rasping noise made when air is inhaled. Trachea\u2014Commonly called the windpipe, it is the air pathway that connects the nose and mouth to the lungs. when a person has symptoms of this protein or is being evaluated for one of the associated diseases. Purpose Cryoglobulin clumps in cold temperatures. This physical characteristic causes people with cryoglobulin to have symptoms during cold weather: blanching, numbness, and pain in their fingers or toes (Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon); bleeding into the skin (purpura); and pain in joints (arthralgia). People with these symptoms or any other symptoms that appear in cold weather should be tested for cryoglobulin. Diseases that cause the body to make extra or abnor- mal proteins are often associated with cryoglobulin. These diseases include cancers involving white blood cells, infections, autoimmune disorders , and rheuma- toid diseases. This test provides information about the cause of symptoms in a person who already has a disease process. It doesn\u2019t diagnose a specific disease or monitor the course of a disease. Precautions This test is not a screening test for disease in a per- son without symptoms. Description Laboratory testing for cryoglobulin is based on the fact that cryoglobulin clumps when cooled and dissolves when warmed. The test is done on a person\u2019s serum (the yellow liquid part of blood that separates from the cells after the blood clots). The serum is kept warm from the time drawn until the cells and the serum are separated in the laboratory. The serum is placed at 33.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) for one to seven days. If there is clumping, cryoglobulins are present. The amount of cryoglobulins is determined by measuring the amount of clumping. Negative tests are checked through seven days. Additional testing is done to find out what kind of cryoglobulin protein is present. There are three kinds of cryoglobulin, each associated with different diseases. The test, also called the cold sensitivity antibodies test, is covered by insurance when medically necessary. Results are usually available the following day.

This rapid rewarming halts ice crystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels. Aloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) is applied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele- vated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on the extent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned by removing foreign material) or simply covered with aloe vera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to prevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen to combat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in most cases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen- sation returns during rewarming. Except when injury is minimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay of several days, during which hydrotherapy and physical therapy are used to restore the affected part to health. Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissue removal, and advise that 22\u201345 days must pass before a decision on amputation can safely be made. Frostnip Frostnipped fingers are helped by blowing warm air on them or holding them under one\u2019s armpits. Other frostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. The injured areas should never be rubbed. Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners suggest several kinds of treatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving the hospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or using contrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con- trast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold water applications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient can stand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol- lowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. These applications are repeated three times each, ending with the cold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissue growth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo- pathic and botanical therapies may also assist recovery from frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per- foratum) is recommended when nerve ending are affected (especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica montana) is prescribed for shock. Cayenne pepper (Cap- sicum frutescens) can enhance circulation and relieve pain. Drinking hot ginger (Zingiber officinale) tea also aids cir- culation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture to avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy. Prognosis The rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment, pioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much more effective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and amputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degree frostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in 1982\u201385 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss, 25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu- tation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatment using older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly 35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although the comparison group included a higher proportion of sec- ond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatment results was determined to be statistically significant. The extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf- ferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is not the only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the first weeks or months, people often experience tingling, a burning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks from an electric current. Other possible consequences of frost- bite include skin\u2014color changes, nail deformation or loss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every- one, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years\u2014 and sometimes a lifetime\u2014is inevitable. Prevention With the appropriate knowledge and precautions, frostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and most challenging environments. Appropriate clothing and footwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep the blood circulating properly, clothing should be worn loosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and head is also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garments need to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing and footwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco- hol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmful effects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warn against alcohol use and smoking in the cold because of the circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten- tion to the weather report before venturing outdoors and avoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolated areas during a blizzard are also important.

          "content": "Cooling treatments slow chemical reactions within the body. For this reason, cooling tissues below normal temperature (98.6\u00b0F/37\u00b0C) can prevent injury from inad- equate oxygen or nutrition . Cold water drowning vic- tims suffering from hypothermia (cooling of the body below its normal temperature) have been successfully resuscitated after long periods underwater without med- ical complications because of this effect. For the past 40 years, heart surgeons have been experimenting with hypothermia to protect tissues from lack of blood circu- lation during an operation. Neurosurgeons are also work- ing with hypothermia to protect the very sensitive brain tissues during periods of absent or reduced blood flow. Description Depending on the medical need, various cooling methods are used. \u2022 Cold packs and ice bags are placed on a localized site and provide topical relief. These compresses should be covered with a waterproof material to protect the skin. Repeated treatments produce the desired pain and swelling relief. \u2022 Cold treatments are placed on the groin and under the arms to treat hyperthermia. Treatments are refreshed periodically until the appropriate temperature is attained. \u2022 A tepid sponge bath relieves fever without cooling the body too fast. Eighty degrees Farenheit is still 20\u00b0F below body temperature and yet warm enough not to drive blood from the skin, thereby preventing the cool- ing from getting to the body\u2019s core. Limbs are bathed first and then the chest, abdomen, back, and buttocks. \u2022 Perfusion of isolated regions like the brain by using cooled blood is an experimental treatment, offering promising results for the treatment of stroke. Preparation Topical treatments are prepared with ice, cold water (59\u00b0F/15\u00b0C), and chemical cold packs. Tepid baths should be 80\u201393\u00b0F (26.7\u201334\u00b0C). Risks Small children, adults with circulation problems, and the elderly are all at risk of tissue damage. Rapid cooling causes chills, which in effect raise the body\u2019s temperature by raising its metabolism. Blood clots may form from thickened blood caused by the temperature change.

Purpose Anemia, which literally means no blood, refers to blood with abnormally low oxygen-carrying capacity. The hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen. One of the many causes of anemia is destruction of red blood cells, a process called hemolysis (hemo means blood and lysis means disintegration). A simple blood count detects anemia. Even the test done before a blood dona- tion can identify anemia. To detect hemolysis requires other tests. The Coombs\u2019 tests are conducted in order to determine the cause of anemia. One characteristic of hemolysis is the autoimmune response against the body\u2019s red blood cells. Instead of protecting the body from outside agents, the immune system attacks parts of its own body with a deluge of antibodies. Autoimmunity is thought to be the cause of many collagen-vascular diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . It is also the cause of the autoimmune hemolytic anemias . The Coombs\u2019 tests detect the antibodies responsible for the destruction of the red blood cells. Causes of autoimmune hemolytic anemia include: \u2022 drugs such as penicillin, methyldopa (lowers blood pressure), and quinidine (treats heart rhythm distur- bances) \u2022 cancers of the lymph system\u2014Hodgkin\u2019s disease and lymphomas \u2022 virus infections \u2022 collagen-vascular diseases \u2022 mismatched blood transfusions \u2022 Rh incompatibility between a mother and fetus.

At a temperature of -320\u00b0F (-196\u00b0C), liquid nitrogen is the coldest cryogen available. The goal is to freeze the skin growth as quickly as possible, and then let it thaw slowly to cause maximum destruction of the skin cells. A second application may be necessary depending on the size of the growth. In another cryotherapy technique, a device is used to direct a small spray of liquid nitrogen or other cryogen directly onto the skin growth. Freezing may last from five to 20 seconds, depending on the size of the lesion. A second freeze-thaw cycle may be required. Sometimes, the physician will insert a small needle connected to a thermometer into the lesion to make certain the lesion is cooled to a low enough temperature to guarantee maximum destruction. In a third option, liquid nitrogen or another cryogen is cir- culated through a probe to cool it to low temperatures. The probe is then brought into direct contact with the skin lesion to freeze it. The freeze time can take two to three times longer than with the spray technique. Preparation Extensive preparation prior to cryotherapy is not required. The area to be treated should be clean and dry, but sterile preparation is not necessary. Patients should know that they will experience some pain at the time of the freezing, but local anesthesia is usually not required. The physician may want to reduce the size of certain growths, such as warts, prior to the cryotherapy proce- dure, and may have patients apply salicylic acid prepara- tions to the growth over several weeks. Sometimes, the physician will pare away some of the tissue using a device called a curette or a scalpel. Aftercare Redness, swelling, and the formation of a blister at the site of cryotherapy are all expected results of the treatment. A gauze dressing is applied and patients should wash the site three or four times daily while fluid continues to ooze from the wound, usually for five to 14 days. A dry crust then forms that falls off by itself. Woundson the head and neck may take four to six weeks to heal, but those on the body, arms, and legs can take longer. Some patients experi- ence pain at the site following the treatment. This can usu- ally be eased with acetaminophen (Tylenol), though in some cases a stronger pain reliever may be required.

It rarely spreads (metasticizes), but is locally invasive. Cryogen\u2014A substance with a very low boiling point, such as liquid nitrogen, used in cryotherapy treatment. Melanoma \u2014The most dangerous form of skin cancer. It should not be treated with cryotherapy, but should be removed surgically instead. Squamous cell cancer\u2014A form of skin cancer that usually originates in sun-damaged areas or pre- existing lesions; at first local and superficial, it may later spread to other areas of the body. dates for other surgical procedures. As with other surgi- cal procedures, there is some risk of scarring, infection, and damage to underlying skin and tissue. These risks are generally minimal in the hands of experienced users of cryotherapy. Normal results Some redness, swelling, blistering and oozing of fluid are all common results of cryotherapy. Healing time can vary by the site treated and the cryotherapy technique used. When cryogen is applied directly to the growth, healing may occur in three weeks. Growths treated on the head and neck with the spray technique may take four to six weeks to heal; growths treated on other areas of the body may take considerably longer. Cryotherapy boasts high success rates in permanently removing skin growths; even for malignant lesions such as squamous cell and basal cell cancers, studies have shown a cure rate of up to 98%. For certain types of growths, such as some forms of warts, repeat treatments over several weeks are necessary to prevent the growth\u2019s return.

          "content": "gerous: vehicular failure was a predisposing factor in 15% of the Saskatchewan cases. Three nearly simultaneous physiological processes underlie frostbite injury: tissue freezing, tissue hypoxia, and the release of inflammatory mediators. Tissue freezing causes ice crystal formation and other changes that damage and eventually kill cells. Much of this harm occurs because the ice produces pressure changes that cause water (crucial for cell survival) to flow out of the cells. Tissue hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) occurs when the blood vessels in the hands, feet, and other extremities narrow in response to cold. Among its many tasks, blood transfers body heat to the skin, which then dissipates the heat into the environment. Blood vessel narrowing is the body\u2019s way of protecting vital internal organs at the expense of the extremities by reducing heat flow away from the core. However, blood also carries life-sustaining oxygen to the skin and other tissues, and nar- rowed vessels result in oxygen starvation. Narrowing also causes acidosis (an increase in tissue acidity) and increases blood viscosity (thickness). Ultimately, blood stops flowing through the capillaries (the tiny blood vessels that connect the arteries and veins) and blood clots form in the arterioles and venules (the smallest arteries and veins). Damage also occurs to the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. Hypoxia, blood clots, and endothelial damage lead, in turn, to the release of inflammatory mediators (substances that act as links in the inflammatory process), which promote further endothelial damage, hypoxia, and cell destruction. Frostbite is classified by degree of injury (first, sec- ond, third, or fourth), or simply divided into two types, superficial (corresponding to first- or second-degree injury) and deep (corresponding to third- or fourth-degree injury). Most frostbite injuries affect the feet or hands. The remaining 10% of cases typically involve the ears, nose, cheeks, or penis. Once frostbite sets in, the affected part begins to feel cold and, usually, numb; this is followed by a feeling of clumsiness. The skin turns white or yellowish. Many patients experience severe pain in the affected part during rewarming treatment and an intense throbbing pain that arises two or three days later and can last days or weeks. As the skin begins to thaw during treatment, edema (excess tissue fluid) often accumulates, causing swelling. In second- and higher-degree frostbite, blisters appear. Third-degree cases produce deep, blood-filled blis- ters and, during the second week, a hard black eschar (scab). Fourth-degree frostbite penetrates below the skin to the muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones. In severe cases of frostbite the dead tissue can mummify and drop off. Infec- tion is also a possibility. Frostnip Like frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal formation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs and the crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip affects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, and toes. The skin turns pale and one experiences numbness or tingling in the affected part until warming begins. Diagnosis Frostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examina- tion and may also include conventional radiography (x rays), angiography (x-ray examination of the blood ves- sels using an injected dye to provide contrast), thermog- raphy (use of a heat-sensitive device for measuring blood flow), and other techniques for predicting the course of injury and identifying tissue that requires surgical removal. During the initial treatment period, however, a physician cannot judge how a case will progress. Diag- nostic tests only become useful three to five days after rewarming, once the blood vessels have stabilized. Treatment Frostbite Emergency medical help should always be sum- moned whenever frostbite is suspected. While waiting for help to arrive, one should, if possible, remove wet or tight clothing and put on dry, loose clothing or wraps. A splint and padding are used to protect the injured area. Rubbing the area with snow or anything else is dangerous. The key to prehospital treatment is to avoid partial thawing and refreezing, which releases more inflammatory mediators and makes the injury substantially worse. For this reason, the affected part must be kept away from heat sources such as campfires and car heaters. Experts advise rewarming in the field only when emergency help will take more than two hours to arrive and refreezing can be prevented.

Amantadine may provide some limited improvement in ataxic symptoms, but is not recommended in patients with cardiac abnormalities. Physical and occupa- tional therapy are used to maintain range of motion in weak- ened muscles, and to design adaptive techniques and devices to compensate for loss of coordination and strength. Some patients find that using weights on the arms can help dampen the worst of the uncoordinated arm movements. Heart arrhythmias and diabetes are treated with drugs specific to those conditions. Prognosis The rate of progression of FA is highly variable. Most patients lose the ability to walk within 15 years of symp- tom onset, and 95% require a wheelchair for mobility by age 45. Reduction in lifespan from FA complications is also quite variable. Average age at death is in the mid-thir- ties, but may be as late as the mid-sixties. As of mid-1998, the particular length of the triple repeat has not been corre- lated strongly enough with disease progression to allow prediction of the course of the disease on this basis.

Frostbite and frostnip Definition Frostbite is the term for damage to the skin and other tissues caused by freezing. Frostnip is a mild form of cold injury. Description In North America, frostbite is largely confined to Alaska, Canada, and the northern states. Recent years have witnessed a substantial decline in the number of cases, probably for several reasons, including better win- ter clothing and footwear and greater public understand- ing of how to avoid cold-weather dangers. At the same time, the nature of the at-risk population has changed as rising numbers of homeless people have made frostbite an urban as well as a rural public health concern. The growing popularity of outdoor winter activities has also expanded the at-risk population. Causes and symptoms Frostbite Skin exposed to temperatures a little below the freezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold skin can freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature, wind speed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin becomes. A strong wind can lower skin temperature considerably by dispersing the thin protective layer of warm air that surrounds our bodies. Wet clothing readily draws heat away from the skin because water is a potent conductor of heat. The evaporation of moisture on the skin also pro- duces cooling. For these reasons, wet skin or clothing on a windy day can lead to frostbite even if the air tempera- ture is above the freezing mark. The extent of permanent injury, however, is deter- mined not by how cold the skin and the underlying tis- sues become but by how long they remain frozen. Conse- quently, homeless people and others whose self-preser- vation instincts may be clouded by alcohol or psychiatric illness face a greater risk of frostbite-related amputation because they are more likely to stay out in the cold when prudence dictates seeking shelter or medical attention. Alcohol also affects blood circulation in the extremities in a way that can increase the severity of injury (as does smoking). A review of 125 Saskatchewan frostbite cases found a tie to alcohol in 46% and to psychiatric illness in 17%. Other risk factors identified by researchers include inadequate clothing, previous cold injury, fatigue , wound infection, atherosclerosis (an arterial disease), and diabetes.

Diagnosis Anyone who is suspected to have dyslexia should have a comprehensive evaluation, including hearing, vision, and intelligence testing. The test should include all areas of learning and learning processes, not just reading. As further research pinpoints the genes responsible for some cases of dyslexia, there is a possibility that ear- lier testing will be established to allow for timely inter- ventions to prevent the onset of the condition and to treat it when it does occur. Unfortunately, in many schools, a child is not identi- fied as having dyslexia until after repeated failures. Treatment If a child is diagnosed with dyslexia, the parents should find out from the school or the diagnostician exactly what the problem is, and what method of teach- ing is recommended and why. No single method will work with every child, and experts often disagree as to the best method to use. The primary focus of treatment is aimed at helping the specific learning problem of each affected person. Most often, this may include modifying teaching meth- ods and the educational environment, since traditional educational methods will not always work with a dyslex- ic child. People with dyslexia need a structured language pro- gram, with direct instruction in the letter-sound system. Teachers must give the rules governing written language. Most experts agree that the teacher should emphasize the association between simple phonetic units with letters or letter groups, rather than an approach that stresses mem- orizing whole words. It is important to teach these students using all the senses: hearing, touching, writing, and speaking, provid- ed by an instructor who is specifically trained in a pro- gram that is effective for dyslexic students. KEY TERMS Spatial skills\u2014The ability to locate objects in three dimensional world using sight or touch. Prognosis Many successful and even famous people have dyslexia. How well a person with dyslexia functions in life depends on the way the disability affects that person. There is a great deal of variation among different people with dyslexia, producing different symptoms and differ- ent degrees of severity. Prognosis is usually good if the condition is diag- nosed early, and if the person has a strong self image with supportive family, friends, and teachers. It is imper- ative for a good outcome that the person be involved in a good remedial program. Resources BOOKS Davis, Ronald D., and Eldon M. Braun.

These vitamins help the body break down complex carbohydrates into simple sug- ars to be used for energy. Excess B vitamins are excreted from the body rather than stored for later use. This is why sufficient daily intake of folic acid is necessary. Description Folic acid is also known as folate, or folacin. It is one of the nutrients most often found to be deficient in the Western diet, and there is evidence that deficiency is a problem on a worldwide scale. Folic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, beans, peas and lentils, liver, beets, brussel sprouts, poultry, nutritional yeast, tuna, wheat germ, mushrooms, oranges, asparagus, broccoli, spinach, bananas, strawberries, and cantaloupes. In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required food manufacturers to add folic acid to enriched bread and grain products to boost intake and to help prevent neural tube defects (NTD). Purpose Folic acid works together with vitamin B 12 and vita- min C to metabolize protein in the body. It is important for the formation of red and white blood cells. It is neces- sary for the proper differentiation and growth of cells and for the development of the fetus. It is also used to form the nucleic acid of DNA and RNA. It increases the appetite and stimulates the production of stomach acid for digestion and it aids in maintaining a healthy liver. A deficiency of folic acid may lead to anemia, in which there is decreased production of red blood cells. This reduces the amounts of oxygen and nutrients that are able to get to the tissues. Symptoms may include fatigue , reduced secretion of digestive acids, confusion, and for- getfulness. During pregnancy , a folic acid deficiency may lead to preeclampsia, premature birth, and increased bleeding after birth. People who are at high risk of strokes and heart dis- ease may greatly benefit by taking folic acid supple- ments. An elevated blood level of the amino acid homo- cysteine has been identified as a risk factor for some of these diseases. High levels of homocysteine have also been found to contribute to problems with osteoporosis. Folic acid, together with vitamins B6 and B12, helps break down homocysteine, and may help reverse the problems associated with elevated levels. Pregnant women have an increased need for folic acid, both for themselves and their child. Folic acid is necessary for the proper growth and development of the fetus. Adequate intake of folic acid is vital for the pre- vention of several types of birth defects , particularly NTDs. The neural tube of the embryo develops into the brain, spinal cord, spinal column, and the skull. If this tube forms incompletely during the first few months of pregnancy a serious, and often fatal, defect results in spina bifida or anencephaly. Folic acid, taken from one year to one month before conception through the first four months of pregnancy, can reduce the risk of NTDs by 50\u201370%. It also helps prevent a cleft lip and palate. Research shows that folic acid can be used to suc- cessfully treat cervical dysplasia, a condition diagnosed by a Pap smear, of having abnormal cells in the cervix. This condition is considered to be a possible precursor to cervical cancer , and is diagnosed as an abnormal Pap smear. Daily consumption of 1,000 mcg of folic acid for three or more months has resulted in improved cervical cells upon repeat Pap smears. Studies suggest that long-term use of folic acid sup- plements may also help prevent lung and colon cancer . Researchers have also found that alcoholics who have low folic acid levels face a greatly increased possibility of developing colon cancer. Preparations To correct a folic acid deficiency, supplements are taken in addition to food. Since the functioning of the B vitamins is interrelated, it is generally recommended that the appropriate dose of B-complex vitamins be taken in place of single B vitamin supplements. The Recom- mended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate is 400 mcg per day for adults, 600 mcg per day for pregnant women, and 500 mcg for nursing women. Medicinal dosages of up to 1,000-2,000 mcg per day may be prescribed. Precautions Folic acid is not stable. It is easily destroyed by exposure to light, air, water, and cooking. Therefore, the supplement should be stored in a dark container in a cold, dry place, such as a refrigerator. Many medications interfere with the body\u2019s absorption and use of folic acid. This includes sulfa drugs, sleeping pills, estrogen, anti- convulsants, birth control pills, antacids , quinine, and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1347 Folic acid",

Maureen Haggerty Follicle-stimulating hormone test Definition The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test measures the amount of FSH in the blood. FSH is a hormone that regulates the growth and development of eggs and sperm, and this test is used to diagnose or evaluate disorders involving the pituitary gland and reproductive system. Purpose FSH testing is performed if a physician suspects the patient may have a disorder involving the reproductive system or pituitary gland. The pituitary gland produces FSH, which stimulates the growth of the sacks (follicles) that surround the eggs in a woman\u2019s ovaries. This is important for the process of ovulation, in which the egg is released. In men, FSH stimulates production of sperm. If there are abnormal levels of FSH in the blood it may mean that one of several disorders are present. Normal fluctuations occur as a result of puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. The FSH test is performed more often on women than on men. In women, it is used to determine if menopause has begun, to diagnose infertility and menstrual disor- ders (such as anovulatory bleeding), to measure hormone levels in children who enter puberty at an early age, and to diagnose other disorders. In men, it can be used to deter- mine early puberty, abnormal tissue growth on one or more of the hormone-secreting (endocrine) glands (called multi- ple endocrine neoplasia), or to diagnose other disorders. Description The FSH test is a blood test. Blood will be drawn from the patient and analyzed in a laboratory. Preparation In preparation for the test, there are no food or fluid intake restrictions. Patients may be advised to discontinue certain medications for 48 hours before the test. A men- struating woman having hot flashes or irregular periods should be tested on the second or third day of her menstru- al cycle. A woman who has missed a period and is having other menopausal symptoms can be tested at any time. Aftercare No aftercare is necessary. Risks There are no risks associated with this test. Normal results Normal FSH test results vary according to age and sexual maturity. The phase of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle or use of birth-control pills also affects test results. For an adult male, normal results range from about 4\u201325 units of FSH in every liter of blood (U/L) or about 5\u201320 micro-international units in every milliliter. For a premenopausal woman, normal values range from 4\u201330 U/L or 5\u201320 micro-international units per milli- liter. In a pregnant woman, FSH levels are too low to mea- sure. After menopause, normal values range from 40\u2013250 U/L or 50\u2013100 micro-international units per milliliter. FSH levels fluctuate during premenopause. If no other symptoms are present, an elevated FSH level should not be interpreted as proof that menopause has begun. Abnormal results Anorexia nervosaand disorders of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland can result in abnormally low FSH levels. Abnormal levels can also indicate: \u2022 infertility \u2022 hypopituitarism \u2022 klinefelter syndrome (in men) GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1350 Follicle-stimulating hormone test",

Recent research has shown that adequate amounts of folic acid can prevent up to half of these birth defects, if women start taking folic acid supplements shortly before conception. A healthy adult needs at least 400 mcg of folic acid every day. Requirements at least double during pregnan- cy, and increase by 50% when a woman is breastfeeding. The average American diet, high in fats, sugar, and white flour, provides about 200 mcg of folic acid, approximate- ly the amount needed to maintain tissue stores of the sub- stance for six to nine months before a deficiency devel- ops. Most of the folic acid in foods (with the exception of the folic acid added to enriched flour and breakfast cere- als) occurs as folate. Folate is only about half as available for the body to use as is the folic acid in pills and supple- ments. Folate also is easily destroyed by sunlight, over- cooking, or the storing of foods at room temperature for an extended period of time. Good dietary sources of folate include: \u2022 leafy green vegetables \u2022l i v e r \u2022 mushrooms \u2022 oatmeal \u2022 peanut butter \u2022 red beans \u2022s o y \u2022 wheat germ Causes and symptoms This condition usually results from a diet lacking in foods with high folic acid content, or from the body\u2019s inability to digest foods or absorb foods having high folic acid content. Other factors that increase the risk of devel- oping folic acid deficiency anemia are: \u2022 age \u2022 alcoholism \u2022 birth-control pills, anticonvulsant therapy, sulfa antibi- otics, and certain other medications \u2022 illness \u2022 smoking \u2022 stress Fatigue is often the first sign of folic acid deficiency anemia. Other symptoms include: \u2022 anorexia nervosa \u2022 pale skin \u2022 paranoia \u2022 rapid heart beat \u2022 sore, inflamed tongue \u2022 weakness \u2022 weight loss Diagnosis Diagnostic procedures include blood tests to mea- sure hemoglobin, an iron-containing compound that car- ries oxygen to cells throughout the body. Symptoms may be reevaluated after the patient has taken prescription folic acid supplements. Treatment Folic acid supplements are usually prescribed, and self-care includes avoiding: \u2022 alcohol \u2022 non-herbal tea, antacids, and phosphates (contained in beer, ice cream, and soft drinks), which restrict iron absorption \u2022 tobacco A person with folic acid deficiency anemia should rest as often as necessary until restored energy levels make it possible to resume regular activities. A doctor should be seen if fever, chills, muscle aches, or new symptoms develop during treatment, or if symptoms do not improve after two weeks of treatment. Alternative treatment Alternative therapies for folic acid deficiency ane- mia may include reflexology concentrated on areas that influence the liver and spleen. Increasing consumption of foods high in folate is helpful. Eating a mixture of yogurt (8 oz) and turmeric (1 tsp) also may help resolve symp- toms. A physician should be contacted if the tongue becomes slick or smooth or the patient: \u2022 bruises or tires easily \u2022 feels ill for more than five days \u2022 feels weak or out of breath \u2022 looks pale or jaundiced Prognosis Although adequate folic acid intake usually cures this condition in about three weeks, folic acid deficiency anemia can make patients infertile or more susceptible to infection.

Congenital Malformations of the Brain. Oxford University Press, 1995. Richard Robinson Congenital defects see Birth defects Congenital hip dysplasia Definition A condition of abnormal development of the hip, resulting in hip joint instability and potential dislocation of the thigh bone from the socket in the pelvis. This con- dition has been more recently termed developmental hip dysplasia, as it often develops over the first few weeks, months, or years of life. Description Congenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children that is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. During gestation, the infant\u2019s hip should be developing with the head of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centered in its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulum should cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit- ting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla- sia, the development of the acetabulum in an infant allows the femoral head to ride upward out of the joint socket, especially when weight bearing begins. Causes and symptoms Clinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip dysplasia, with more females affected than males. This disorder is found in many cultures around the world. However, statistics show that the Native American popu- lation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This has been documented to be due to the common practice of swaddling and using cradleboards for restraining the infants. This places the infant\u2019s hips into extreme adduc- tion (brought together). The incidence of congenital hip dysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian and breech position births. Evidence also shows a greater chance of this hip abnormality in the first born compared to the second or third child. Hormonal changes within the mother during pregnancy, resulting in increased ligament laxity, is thought to possibly cross over to the placenta and cause the baby to have lax ligaments while still in the womb. Other symptoms of complete dislocation include a shortening of the leg and limited ability to abduct the leg. Diagnosis Because the abnormalities of this hip problem often vary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. The hip disorder can be diagnosed by moving the hip to determine if the head of the femur is moving in and out of the hip joint. One specific method, called the Ortolani test, begins with each of the examiners\u2019 hands around the infant\u2019s knees, with the second and third fingers pointing down the child\u2019s thigh. With the legs abducted (moved apart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinct clicking sound with motion. If symptoms are present with a noted increase in abduction, the test is considered positive for hip joint instability. It is important to note this test is only valid a few weeks after birth. The Barlow method is another test performed with the infant\u2019s hip brought together with knees in full bent posi- tion. The examiner\u2019s middle finger is placed over the out- side of the hipbone while the thumb is placed on the inner side of the knee. The hip is abducted to where it can be felt if the hip is sliding out and then back in the joint. In older babies, if there is a lack of range of motion in one hip or even both hips, it is possible that the movement is blocked because the hip has dislocated and the muscles have con- tracted in that position. Also in older infants, hip disloca- tion is evident if one leg looks shorter than the other. X-ray films can be helpful in detecting abnormal find- ings of the hip joint. X rays may also be helpful in finding the proper positioning of the hip joint for treatments of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 892 Congenital hip dysplasia",

Tish Davidson Chest radiography see Chest x ray Chest x ray Definition A chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate organs and structures within the chest for symptoms of disease. Chest x rays include views of the lungs, heart, small por- tions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and the bones of the chest area. X rays are a form of radiation that can penetrate the body and produce an image on an x-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph. Purpose Chest x rays are ordered for a wide variety of diag- nostic purposes. In fact, this is probably the most frequent- ly performed x ray. In some cases, chest x rays are ordered for a single check of an organ\u2019s condition, and at other times, serial x rays are ordered to compare to previous studies. Some common reasons for chest x rays include: Pulmonary disorders Chest films are frequently ordered to diagnose or rule out pneumonia. Other pulmonary disorders such as emphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in the chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected or evaluated through the use of chest x ray. Cancer A chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to check for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoid tissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be primary tumors. X rays also check for secondary spread of can- cer from one organ to another. Cardiac disorders While less sensitive than echocardiography, chest x ray can be used to check for disorders such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

          "content": "monitors in the chest area from the patient\u2019s placement during the exam. Normal results A radiologist, or physician specially trained in the technique and interpretation of x rays, will evaluate the results. A normal chest x ray will show normal structures for the age and medical history or the patient. Findings, whether normal or abnormal, will be provided to the referring physician in the form of a written report. Abnormal results Abnormal findings on chest x rays are used in con- junction with a physician\u2019s physical exam findings, patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to reach a final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays are more effective when compared to previous chest studies. The patient is asked to help the radiology facility in locating previous chest radiographs from other facilities. Pulmonary disorders Pneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches and irregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs). If the bronchi, which are usually not visible, can be seen, a diagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may be made. Shifts or shadows in the hila (lung roots) may indicate emphysema or a pulmonary abscess. Widening of the spaces between ribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases may also be detected or suspected through chest x ray. Cancer In nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort of abnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph. Hilar masses (enlargements at that part of the lungs where ves- sels and nerves enter) are one of the more common symptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid buildup on the outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas. Interstitial lung disease, which is a large category of dis- orders, many of which are related to exposure of sub- stances (such as asbestos fibers), may be detected on a chest x ray as fiberlike deposits, often in the lower por- tions of the lungs. Other Congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases may be indicated on the view of a heart and lung in a chest radiograph. Fractures of the sternum and ribs are usually easily detected as breaks on the chest x ray. In some instances, the radiologist\u2019s view of the diaphragm may indicate an abdominal problem. Tuberculosis can also be indicated by elevation of the diaphragm. Foreign bodies which may have been swallowed or inhaled can usually be located by the radiologist as they will look dif- ferent from any other tissue or structure in the chest. Ser- ial chest x rays may be ordered to track changes over a period of time. Resources ORGANIZATIONS American Lung Association. 1740 Broadway, New York, NY 10019.

Teresa Norris, RN Chickenpox Definition Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and extremely infectious childhood disease that also affects adults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash that typically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa- nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of chickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunity against the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken- pox are easily recognized and in most cases merely unpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost always be carried out at home. Severe complications can develop, however, and professional medical attention is essential in some circumstances. Description Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children born each year in the United States contracted chicken- pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000 cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari- cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family), which is spread through the air or by direct contact with an infected person. Once someone has been infected with the virus, an incubation period of about 10\u201321 days pass- es before symptoms begin. The period during which infected people are able to spread the disease is believed to start one or two days before the rash breaks out and to continue until all the blisters have formed scabs, which usually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 749 Chickenpox",

Chest x rays are used to see foreign bodies that may have been swallowed or inhaled, and to evaluate response to treatment for various diseases. Often the chest x ray is also used to verify correct placement of chest tubes or catheters. KEY TERMS Bronchi\u2014Plural of bronchus. The air passages in the lungs through which inhaled air passes on its way to the lungs. Diaphragm \u2014The large muscle that is located between the abdomen and the chest area. The diaphragm aids in breathing. Gastrointestinal\u2014The digestive organs and struc- tures, including the stomach and intestines. Interstitial lung disease \u2014About 180 diseases fall into this category of breathing disorders. Injury or foreign substances in the lungs, (such as asbestos fibers) as well as infections, cancers, or inherited disorders may cause the diseases. They can lead to breathing or heart failure. Lymphoid\u2014Tissues relating to the lymphatic sys- tem. A thin, yellowish fluid, called lymph fluid, travels throughout the body. The lymphatic system helps control fluids in the body. Portable chest x ray\u2014An x ray procedure taken by equipment that can be brought to the patient. The resulting radiographs may not be as high in quality as stationary x ray radiographs, but allow a tech- nologist to come to the bedridden patient. Pulmonary\u2014Refers to the lungs and the breathing system and function. Serial x rays\u2014A number of x rays performed at set times in the disease progression or treatment inter- vals. The radiographs will be compared to one another to track changes. Sternum\u2014Also referred to as the breast bone, this is the long flat bone in the middle of the chest. Thorax\u2014The chest area, which runs between the abdomen and neck and is encased in the ribs. X ray\u2014A form of electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays can penetrate most structures. Precautions Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or second trimester, should not have chest x rays unless absolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women who are, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec- tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia- tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure, particularly for children. However, the amount of radia- tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal. Description Routine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal view (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat- eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand for this exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid in the lungs. During the actual time of exposure, the technologist will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is very important in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is no motion that could detract from the quality and sharpness of the film image. The procedure will only take a few minutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is a matter of a few seconds. The chest x ray may be performed in a physician\u2019s office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or hospital radiology department. In some cases, particular- ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may be taken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality than those taken with permanent equipment, but are the best choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden patients may be placed in as upright a position as possi- ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid. Preparation There is no advance preparation necessary for chest x rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam area, a hospi- tal gown will replace all clothing on the upper body and all jewelry must be removed. Aftercare No aftercare is required by patients who have chest x rays. Risks The only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal exposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant women and children. Those patients should use protective lead aprons during the procedure.

Description A concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit by an object, or when the brain is jarred against the skull, with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of function in the higher centers of the brain. The injured person may remain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and is disoriented for some minutes after the blow. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderate sports-related brain injuries each year, most of them young men between 16 and 25. While concussion usually resolves on its own with- out lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much more serious condition. \u201cSecond impact syndrome\u201d occurs when a person with a concussion, even a very mild one, suffers a second blow before fully recovering from the first. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres- sure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 such cases have been reported since the syndrome was first described in 1984. Causes and symptoms Causes Most concussions are caused by motor vehicle acci- dents and sports injuries . In motor vehicle accidents, concussion can occur without an actual blow to the head. Instead, concussion occurs because the skull suddenly decelerates or stops, which causes the brain to be jarred against the skull.

It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants. However, cough KEY TERMS Antitussives\u2014Drugs used to suppress coughing. Expectorant\u2014Drug used to thin mucus. Gastroesophageal reflux \u2014Condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Glottis\u2014The opening between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx. Larynx\u2014A part of the respiratory tract between the pharynx and the trachea, having walls of cartilage and muscle and containing the vocal cords. Sputum\u2014The mixture of mucus, irritants, and other substances expelled from the lungs by coughing. medicines may be given if the patient cannot rest because of the cough or if the cough is not productive, as is the case with most coughs associated with colds or flu. The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under- lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942 Cough",

These scans allow for cross- sectional views of body organs and tissues. Purpose CT scans are used to image a wide variety of body structures and internal organs. Since the 1990s, CT equipment has become more affordable and available. In some diagnoses, CT scans have become the first imaging exam of choice. Because the computerized image is so sharp, focused, and three-dimensional, many tissues can be better differentiated than on standard x rays. Common CT indications include: \u2022 Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of sinusi- tis and bone fractures . Physicians may order a CT of the sinuses to provide an accurate map for surgery. \u2022 Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas, tumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning, especially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need for more invasive procedures such as cerebral angiography. \u2022 Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used to observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kid- neys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, and extremities. \u2022 Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or abdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possible aortic diseases. \u2022 Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in distin- guishing tumors and in detailing accumulation of fluid in chest infections. Precautions Pregnant women or those who could possibly be pregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnostic benefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients should par- ticularly avoid full body or abdominal scans. If the exam is necessary for obstetrics purposes, technologists are instructed not to repeat films if there are errors. Pregnant patients receiving CT or any x-ray exam away from the abdominal area may be protected by a lead apron; most radiation, known as scatter, travels through the body and is not blocked by the apron. Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and the use of these agents should be discussed with the medical professional prior to the procedure. Patients should be asked to sign a consent form concerning the administra- tion of contrast. One of the common contrast agents, iodine, can cause allergic reactions. Patients who are known to be allergic to iodine (or shellfish) should inform the physician prior to the CT scan. Description Computed tomography, also called CT scan, CAT scan, or computerized axial tomography, is a combina- tion of focused x-ray beams and computerized produc- tion of an image. Introduced in the early 1970s, this radi- ologic procedure has advanced rapidly and is now widely used, sometimes in the place of standard x rays. CT equipment A CT scan may be performed in a hospital or outpa- tient imaging center. Although the equipment looks large and intimidating, it is very sophisticated and fairly com- fortable. The patient is asked to lie on a gantry, or narrow table, that slides into the center of the scanner. The scan- ner looks like a doughnut and is round in the middle, which allows the x-ray beam to rotate around the patient. The scanner section may also be tilted slightly to allow for certain cross-sectional angles.

Medical therapy to treat the adenomatous polyps has been attempted. Some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been effective in reducing the number and size of the polyps. It is possible that these agents will be used as an additional treatment for FAP, but they are unlikely to replace surgery. Individuals with FAP are at increased risk for cancers of the upper digestive tract including the upper portion of the small bowel (dudodenum) and the channels where bile flows (biliary tract). Cancers of the thyroid, pancreas, and adrenal gland are also more commonly found among FAP patients. Periodic examination for the development of malignancy in these areas is considered part of the treatment of FAP. In some cases, such as cancer involving the duodenum, the tests themselves carry a chance of complications. The risk of the study must be weighed against the potential benefits of knowing the results. Non- malignant growths, called desmoid tumors, also occur more frequently in patients with FAP. Although they are not malignant, they grow quickly into surrounding tis- sues, causing many difficulties, even death in some cases. Prognosis The major cause of death in many patients with FAP remains colorectal cancer. One study suggested that even with improved disease recognition, social and emotional factors, such as fear of surgery, may significantly delay a patient\u2019s treatment. In recent years, the trend is towards mortality from other causes, such as desmoid tumors or cancers other than colorectal. It has been estimated that a patient with known FAP has a relative risk of dying over three times greater than that of the average population, at a given age. Prevention FAP cannot be prevented. Aggressive diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up monitoring are keys to success- ful management of the disease. Resources ORGANIZATIONS Familial Polyposis Registry. Department of Colorectal Surgery.

Family therapy Definition Family therapy is a form of psychotherapy that involves all the members of a nuclear or extended family. It may be conducted by a pair or team of therapists. In many cases the team consists of a man and a woman in order to treat gender-related issues or serve as role mod- els for family members. Although some forms of family therapy are based on behavioral or psychodynamic prin- ciples, the most widespread form is based on family sys- tems theory. This approach regards the family, as a whole, as the unit of treatment, and emphasizes such fac- tors as relationships and communication patterns rather than traits or symptoms in individual members. Family therapy is a relatively recent development in psychotherapy. It began shortly after World War II, when doctors, who were treating schizophrenic patients, noticed that the patients\u2019 families communicated in dis- turbed ways. The doctors also found that the patients\u2019 symptoms rose or fell according to the level of tension between their parents. These observations led to consid- ering a family as an organism or system with its own internal rules, patterns of functioning, and tendency to resist change. The therapists started to treat the families of schizophrenic patients as whole units rather than focusing on the hospitalized member. They found that in many cases the family member with schizophrenia improved when the \u201cpatient\u201d was the family system. (This should not be misunderstood to mean that schizo- phrenia is caused by family problems, although family problems may worsen the condition.) This approach of involving the entire family in the treatment plan and ther- apy was then applied to families with problems other than the presence of schizophrenia. Family therapy is becoming an increasingly com- mon form of treatment as changes in American society are reflected in family structures. It has led to two further developments: couples therapy, which treats relationship GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1287 Family therapy",

Familial polyposis Definition Familial polyposis is an inherited condition which primarily affects the large intestine (colon and rectum). Large numbers of projecting masses of swollen and thickened or tumorous membrane (polyps) develop on the inner lining of this part of the bowel. The polyps eventually become malignant. Description Familial polyposis (FP) is known by many syn- onyms, most include some combination of words which reflect what is known about the disease. As the disease is inherited, the word, family, is often included. Because these mushroom-like growths are the most obvious mani- festation of the disorder, the word, polyp, is usually in the term as well. Adenoma refers to the particular kind of polyp that is typically discovered. Some of the names found in medical texts and journals include polyposis coli, familial colonic polyposis, multiple familial polypo- sis, familial adenomatous colon polyposis, adenomatosis of the colon and rectum (ACR), and familial adenoma- tous polyposis (FAP). The last term and its abbreviation have been commonly used since the early 1990s. It will be used in this discussion. Familial polyposis or familial adenomatous poly- posis (FAP) is a premalignant disease. This means that a person with FAP, if left untreated, will invariably develop cancer . Individuals with this disorder grow hundreds of polyps throughout their large intestines. The polyps, which may also be called adenomas, com- monly develop just after puberty . Approximately half of all FAP patients will have polyps by age 14. Ninety percent will have detectable polyps by age 25. Usually by age 35\u201340, one or more of these polyps will become cancerous. FAP is a rare disease. One in 8,000 people in the United States have FAP. However, it may be very com- mon in affected families. FAP is inherited in an autoso- mal dominant pattern. This means that a person with FAP has a 50% chance of passing the condition down to each of their children. FAP can also develop in someone with no family history of the disorder, due to a new genetic mutation in that individual. It is thought that approxi- mately one percent of all colorectal cancers in the United States can be attributed to FAP. Causes and symptoms FAP is caused by a portion of a gene that mutates or changes. The original cause of the mutation is unknown. Its exact role in FAP is not completely clear. Researchers theorize that the normal gene directs the manufacture of a protein which helps control cell growth. The mutated gene section in FAP generates an abnormal protein which does not perform its normal function. Cells grow out of control, causing the development of multiple, sometimes hundreds, of polyps. One or more of these eventually becomes cancerous. Many individuals develop polyps without display- ing any symptoms. Others experience such gastrointesti- nal problems as diarrhea , constipation , abdominal cramps, blood in the stool, or weight loss. FAP patients may also develop nonmalignant tumors (desmoid tumors), and/or some bone and dental abnormalities. In addition, they may exhibit a \u201cspot\u201d on the retina of the eye (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, or CHRPE). Relatives of individuals with diagnosed FAP are at high risk of having the disease themselves. There are no other known risk factors for this condition.

          "content": "As for genetic predisposition, on chromosome 5, there is a gene called the APC gene associated with the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. There are multiple different mutations that occur at this site, yet they all cause a defect in tumor suppression that results in early and frequent development of colon cancer. This genetic aberration is transmitted to 50% of offspring and each of those affected will develop colon cancer, usually at an early age. There is another syndrome, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (also known as Lynch syn- drome), related to mutations in any of four genes respon- sible for DNA mismatch repair. In patients with colon cancer, the p53 gene is mutated 70% of the time. When the p53 gene is mutated and ineffective, cells with dam- aged DNA escape repair or destruction. This allows for the damaged cell to perpetuate itself, and continued replication of the damaged DNA may lead to tumor development. Though these syndromes have a very high incidence of colon cancer, family history without the syndrome is also a substantial risk factor. When consid- ering first-degree relatives, history of one with colon can- cer raises the baseline risk of 2% to 6%. (Most physi- cians think that this baseline is about 4%.) The presence of a second raises the risk to 17%. The development of polyps of the colon almost always precedes the development of colon cancer by five or more years. Polyps are benign growths of the colon lining. They can be unrelated to cancer, precancerous, or malignant. Polyps, when identified, are removed for diagnosis. If the polyps are benign, the patient should undergo careful surveillance for the development of more polyps or the development of colon cancer. Colon cancer causes symptoms related to its local presence in the large bowel or by its effect on other organs if it has spread. These symptoms may occur alone or in combination: \u2022 a change in bowel habit \u2022 blood in the stool \u2022 bloating, persistent abdominal distention \u2022 constipation \u2022 a feeling of fullness even after having a bowel move- ment \u2022 narrowing of the stool\u2014so-called ribbon stools \u2022 persistent, chronic fatigue \u2022 abdominal discomfort \u2022 unexplained weight loss \u2022 very rarely, nausea and vomiting Most of these symptoms are caused by the physical presence of the tumor mass in the colon. Similar symp- toms can be caused by other processes; these are not absolutely specific to colon cancer. The key is recogniz- ing that the persistence of these types of symptoms with- out ready explanation should prompt the individual to seek medical evaluation. Many of the symptoms are understood by remem- bering that the colon is a tubular conduit. If a tumor develops, as it reaches a certain size it will begin to cause symptoms related to the obstruction of that conduit. In addition, the tumor commonly oozes blood that is lost in the stool. (Often, this blood is not visible.) This phenom- enon results in anemia and chronic fatigue. Weight loss is a late symptom, often implying substantial obstruction or the presence of systemic disease. Diagnosis Screening Of all of the major cancers, only colorectal cancer can be prevented by screening. In all other cancers (breast and prostate, for example), screening tests look for small, malignant lesions. Screening for colorectal cancers, how- ever, is the search for pre-malignant, benign polyps. This screening can be close to 100% effective in preventing cancer development, not just in detecting small cancers. Screening involves physical exam, simple laboratory tests, and the visualization of the lining of the colon. The ways to visualize the colon epithelium are with x rays (indi- rect visualization), and endoscopy (direct visualization). The physical examination involves the perfor- mance of a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE includes manual examination of the rectum, anus, and the prostate. During this examination, the physician exam- ines the anus and the surrounding skin for hemorrhoids, abscesses, and other irregularities. After lubricating the gloved finger and anus, the examiner gently slides the finger into the anus and follows the contours of the rec- tum. The examiner notes the tone of the anus and feels the walls and the edges for texture, tenderness and mass- es as far as the examining finger can reach. At the time of this exam, the physician checks the stool on the examin- ing glove with a chemical to see if any occult (invisible), blood is present. At home, after having a bowel move- ment, the patient is asked to swipe a sample of stool obtained with a small stick on a card. After 3 such speci- mens are on the card, the card is then easily chemically tested for occult blood also. (The stool analysis men- tioned here is known as a fecal occult blood test ,o r FOBT, and, while it can be helpful, it is not 100% accu- rate\u2014only about 50% of cancers are FOBT-positive.) These exams are accomplished as an easy part of a rou- tine yearly physical exam. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 850 Colon cancer",

          "content": "Diagnosis The abnormal portion of the gene that causes FAP in most patients can be detected. A blood test can then be performed which identifies family members who have the same mutation. They will eventually develop the condi- tion. Children who have a parent with FAP, and siblings of affected patients whose parental history is incomplete, should be evaluated. The polyps characteristic of FAP have been found in children as young as age five. Testing of appropriate individuals should take place as soon as the diagnosis of FAP is established in one member of a family. Relatives of people with diagnosed FAP should exercise caution regarding where they seek advice and testing. One study of a commercially available blood test found that less than 20% of patients received any genetic counseling, and almost one third of their physicians mis- interpreted the test results. Registries for FAP patients can be found at many sites in the United States. Such a registry specializes in identification, assistance, and education of people with a particular disease, and is usually a separate department in a research hospital. A team of health professionals who have expertise in the disorder staff the registry. Testing within a research setting and/or at a facility with a registry of patients with FAP is more likely to safeguard against problems, such as the misunderstand- ing of test results. As part of a research project, some- times counseling as well as blood tests are available at no charge to the patient. Insurance coverage varies. Con- cerns about confidentiality, and future insurance and employment discrimination, may prompt individuals to pay for the examination out of pocket. Commercial blood tests cost approximately $250 per sample. If the abnormal gene is found in a family member, annual screening for colon polyps is recommended, beginning at age 11. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is used for this examination. It is usually done in a physician\u2019s office, or in a hospital department, most often by a gas- troenterologist or a surgeon. Food intake may be restrict- ed for 24 hours prior to the procedure. Before the study, the intestine is cleared of stool by one or more small ene- mas. Some physicians prefer to sedate the patient, to help them relax. Then a flexible, lighted, hollow tube (sigmoidoscope) is inserted into the anus and maneu- vered into the large intestine. The physician examines the wall of the colon to look for polyps. If polyps are found, one or more may be removed for biopsy. Most patients report little discomfort during the examination. The procedure itself takes five to fifteen minutes. The patient may be at the facility an hour, or more, if recovery from sedation is needed. If no medica- tion was administered, driving and resumption of normal activities are permitted immediately. The cost of the pro- cedure varies widely, but, as of 1997, it was covered by Medicare, indicating the likelihood of other types of insurance coverage. In some cases the portion of the gene responsible for FAP cannot be identified. Family members of these patients cannot have a predictive blood test. The current recommendation is for these patients to have the same annual examination with flexible sigmoidoscopy as patients with a diagnosed FAP gene. A noninvasive screening eye examination to detect CHRPE, associated with FAP, may also be performed. Treatment The only definitive treatment for FAP is surgical removal of the lower intestine. Since the goal is to pre- vent cancer, the operation is done as soon as adenoma- tous polyps are found on sigmoidoscopy. Waiting until a polyp becomes malignant is unsafe, as the cancer may invade surrounding tissues. There are several choices about the type of surgery to treat this condition. Some authorities advocate removal of the colon, leaving the rectum or lowest portion of the intestine in place. The small intestine can be attached to the rectum, allowing normal bowel function. This is often called ileorectal anastomosis. Others argue that this sec- tion is also liable to develop polyps, needs to be moni- tored regularly, and may require eventual removal. Excision of the entire lower intestine with preserva- tion of normal bowel function is possible. This entails a more complex surgical procedure. The patient may expe- rience more complications and a longer recovery period. However, the risk of polyp development in this area is very low. Periodic examination of the intestine may not be needed once healing is complete. The more intricate surgery may be referred to as a J- pouch procedure, an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, a restorative proctocolectomy, or an ileoanal reservoir proce- dure. It involves creating a \u201cpouch\u201d of tissue from the small intestine, which is attached to the anus. This serves as a reservoir or holding area for stool, much as the rectum does normally. The surgery is often done in several stages. A temporary ileostomy, which creates an opening of the small intestines onto the abdomen, is required. When all proce- dures are completed, and after a recuperation period, the patient regains normal bowel function through the anus. Some researchers suggest that as genetic testing becomes more developed, the specific portion of the gene involved may dictate the type of surgery chosen.

Diagnosis Anyone who is suspected to have dyslexia should have a comprehensive evaluation, including hearing, vision, and intelligence testing. The test should include all areas of learning and learning processes, not just reading. As further research pinpoints the genes responsible for some cases of dyslexia, there is a possibility that ear- lier testing will be established to allow for timely inter- ventions to prevent the onset of the condition and to treat it when it does occur. Unfortunately, in many schools, a child is not identi- fied as having dyslexia until after repeated failures. Treatment If a child is diagnosed with dyslexia, the parents should find out from the school or the diagnostician exactly what the problem is, and what method of teach- ing is recommended and why. No single method will work with every child, and experts often disagree as to the best method to use. The primary focus of treatment is aimed at helping the specific learning problem of each affected person. Most often, this may include modifying teaching meth- ods and the educational environment, since traditional educational methods will not always work with a dyslex- ic child. People with dyslexia need a structured language pro- gram, with direct instruction in the letter-sound system. Teachers must give the rules governing written language. Most experts agree that the teacher should emphasize the association between simple phonetic units with letters or letter groups, rather than an approach that stresses mem- orizing whole words. It is important to teach these students using all the senses: hearing, touching, writing, and speaking, provid- ed by an instructor who is specifically trained in a pro- gram that is effective for dyslexic students.

Prognosis is usually good if the condition is diag- nosed early, and if the person has a strong self image with supportive family, friends, and teachers.

Findings, whether normal or abnormal, will be provided to the referring physician in the form of a written report. Abnormal results Abnormal findings on chest x rays are used in con- junction with a physician\u2019s physical exam findings, patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to reach a final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays are more effective when compared to previous chest studies. The patient is asked to help the radiology facility in locating previous chest radiographs from other facilities. Pulmonary disorders Pneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches and irregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs). If the bronchi, which are usually not visible, can be seen, a diagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may be made. Shifts or shadows in the hila (lung roots) may indicate emphysema or a pulmonary abscess. Widening of the spaces between ribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases may also be detected or suspected through chest x ray. Cancer In nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort of abnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph. Hilar masses (enlargements at that part of the lungs where ves- sels and nerves enter) are one of the more common symptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid buildup on the outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas. Interstitial lung disease, which is a large category of dis- orders, many of which are related to exposure of sub- stances (such as asbestos fibers), may be detected on a chest x ray as fiberlike deposits, often in the lower por- tions of the lungs.

Fractures of the sternum and ribs are usually easily detected as breaks on the chest x ray. In some instances, the radiologist\u2019s view of the diaphragm may indicate an abdominal problem. Tuberculosis can also be indicated by elevation of the diaphragm. Foreign bodies which may have been swallowed or inhaled can usually be located by the radiologist as they will look dif- ferent from any other tissue or structure in the chest.

Teresa Norris, RN Chickenpox Definition Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and extremely infectious childhood disease that also affects adults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash that typically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa- nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of chickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunity against the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken- pox are easily recognized and in most cases merely unpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost always be carried out at home. Severe complications can develop, however, and professional medical attention is essential in some circumstances. Description Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children born each year in the United States contracted chicken- pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000 cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari- cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family), which is spread through the air or by direct contact with an infected person. Once someone has been infected with the virus, an incubation period of about 10\u201321 days pass- es before symptoms begin. The period during which infected people are able to spread the disease is believed to start one or two days before the rash breaks out and to continue until all the blisters have formed scabs, which usually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 749 Chickenpox",

Tish Davidson Chest radiography see Chest x ray Chest x ray Definition A chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate organs and structures within the chest for symptoms of disease. Chest x rays include views of the lungs, heart, small por- tions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and the bones of the chest area. X rays are a form of radiation that can penetrate the body and produce an image on an x-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph. Purpose Chest x rays are ordered for a wide variety of diag- nostic purposes. In fact, this is probably the most frequent- ly performed x ray. In some cases, chest x rays are ordered for a single check of an organ\u2019s condition, and at other times, serial x rays are ordered to compare to previous studies. Some common reasons for chest x rays include: Pulmonary disorders Chest films are frequently ordered to diagnose or rule out pneumonia. Other pulmonary disorders such as emphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in the chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected or evaluated through the use of chest x ray. Cancer A chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to check for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoid tissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be primary tumors. X rays also check for secondary spread of can- cer from one organ to another. Cardiac disorders While less sensitive than echocardiography, chest x ray can be used to check for disorders such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

          "content": "Other Tuberculosis can be observed on chest x rays, as can cardiac disease and damage to the ribs or lungs. Chest x rays are used to see foreign bodies that may have been swallowed or inhaled, and to evaluate response to treatment for various diseases. Often the chest x ray is also used to verify correct placement of chest tubes or catheters. KEY TERMS Bronchi\u2014Plural of bronchus. The air passages in the lungs through which inhaled air passes on its way to the lungs. Diaphragm \u2014The large muscle that is located between the abdomen and the chest area. The diaphragm aids in breathing. Gastrointestinal\u2014The digestive organs and struc- tures, including the stomach and intestines. Interstitial lung disease \u2014About 180 diseases fall into this category of breathing disorders. Injury or foreign substances in the lungs, (such as asbestos fibers) as well as infections, cancers, or inherited disorders may cause the diseases. They can lead to breathing or heart failure. Lymphoid\u2014Tissues relating to the lymphatic sys- tem. A thin, yellowish fluid, called lymph fluid, travels throughout the body. The lymphatic system helps control fluids in the body. Portable chest x ray\u2014An x ray procedure taken by equipment that can be brought to the patient. The resulting radiographs may not be as high in quality as stationary x ray radiographs, but allow a tech- nologist to come to the bedridden patient. Pulmonary\u2014Refers to the lungs and the breathing system and function. Serial x rays\u2014A number of x rays performed at set times in the disease progression or treatment inter- vals. The radiographs will be compared to one another to track changes. Sternum\u2014Also referred to as the breast bone, this is the long flat bone in the middle of the chest. Thorax\u2014The chest area, which runs between the abdomen and neck and is encased in the ribs. X ray\u2014A form of electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays can penetrate most structures. Precautions Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or second trimester, should not have chest x rays unless absolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women who are, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec- tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia- tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure, particularly for children. However, the amount of radia- tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal. Description Routine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal view (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat- eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand for this exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid in the lungs. During the actual time of exposure, the technologist will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is very important in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is no motion that could detract from the quality and sharpness of the film image. The procedure will only take a few minutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is a matter of a few seconds. The chest x ray may be performed in a physician\u2019s office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or hospital radiology department. In some cases, particular- ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may be taken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality than those taken with permanent equipment, but are the best choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden patients may be placed in as upright a position as possi- ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid. Preparation There is no advance preparation necessary for chest x rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam area, a hospi- tal gown will replace all clothing on the upper body and all jewelry must be removed. Aftercare No aftercare is required by patients who have chest x rays. Risks The only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal exposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant women and children. Those patients should use protective lead aprons during the procedure.

Hives may develop later and usually do not require treatment. Risks Radiation exposure from a CT scan is similar to, though higher than, that of a conventional x ray. Although this is a risk to pregnant women, the exposure to other adults is minimal and should produce no effects. Although severe contrast reactions are rare, they are a risk of many CT procedures. Normal results Normal findings on a CT exam show bone, the most dense tissue, as white areas. Tissues and fat will show as various shades of gray, and fluids will be gray or black. Air will also look black. Intravenous, oral, and rectal con- trast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determine if tissues and organs appear normal by the sensitivity of the gray shadows. In CT, the images that can cut through a section of tissue or organ provide three-dimensional viewing for the radiologist and referring physician. Abnormal results Abnormal results may show different characteristics of tissues within organs. Accumulations of blood or other fluids where they do not belong may be detected. Radiol- ogists can differentiate among types of tumors through- out the body by viewing details of their makeup. Sinus studies The increasing availability and lowered cost of CT scanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies, either as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a follow-up to an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of CT allows for location of areas of sinus infection, particularly chronic infection. CT scans can show the extent and loca- tion of tiny fractures to the sinus and nasal bones. Foreign bodies in the sinus and nasal area are also easily detected by CT. CT imaging of the sinuses is important in evaluat- ing trauma or disease of the sphenoid bone (the wedge shaped bone at the base of the skull). Sinus tumors will show as shades of gray indicating the difference in their density from that of normal tissues in the area. Brain studies The precise differences in density allowed by CT scan can clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the brain area as altered densities. These lighter or darker areas on the image may indicate a tumor or hematoma within the brain and skull area. Different types of tumors can be identified by the presence of edema, by the tissue\u2019s density, or by studying blood vessel location and activity. The speed and convenience of CT often allows for detection of hemorrhage before symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities in children, such as hydrocephalus, may also be confirmed with CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement of the fluid structures called ventricles of the brain. Body scans The body scan can identify abnormal body structures and organs. Throughout the body, a CT may indicate tumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormal collec- tions of fluids, blood or fat, and metastasis of cancer. Tumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeup than primary tumors, or those that originate in the loca- tion of study. Fractures or damage to soft tissues and liga- ments will be more easily seen on the sensitive images produced by CT scanning, though CT is not usually done for these. Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed or fatty liver, may be observed on the body scan. CT of the aorta CT provides the ability to see and measure the thick- ness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in diagnos- ing aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will help see details within the aorta. In addition, density can identify calcification, and this helps differentiate between acute and chronic problems. An abnormal CT scan may indi- cate signs of aortic clots. Aortic rupture is suggested by signs such as a hematoma around the aorta or the escape of blood from its cavity.

Description A concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit by an object, or when the brain is jarred against the skull, with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of function in the higher centers of the brain. The injured person may remain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and is disoriented for some minutes after the blow. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderate sports-related brain injuries each year, most of them young men between 16 and 25. While concussion usually resolves on its own with- out lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much more serious condition. \u201cSecond impact syndrome\u201d occurs when a person with a concussion, even a very mild one, suffers a second blow before fully recovering from the first. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres- sure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 such cases have been reported since the syndrome was first described in 1984. Causes and symptoms Causes Most concussions are caused by motor vehicle acci- dents and sports injuries . In motor vehicle accidents, concussion can occur without an actual blow to the head. Instead, concussion occurs because the skull suddenly decelerates or stops, which causes the brain to be jarred against the skull.

Sometimes the patient may also experience pain in the chest resem- bling a heart attack. A series of x rays taken while swal- lowing a contrast agent usually demonstrates the divertic- ulum clearly. An esophagoscopy may also be needed to gather more detail. Manometry, measuring pressures inside the esophagus using a balloon that is passed down it, may help determine the cause of the diverticula. Treatment Treatment for this condition is primarily aimed at alleviating symptoms. Physicians direct the patient to eat a bland diet, to chew his or her food thoroughly, and to drink water after eating to clean out the pouches. If the condition is severe, several types of surgery are available to remove the pouches and repair the defects. If a pouch is due to a stenosis (narrowing) in the esophagus it may be possible to relieve it by passing a dilator through it, a process called bougeinage.

It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants.

The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under- lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942 Cough",

          "content": "Diagnosis A major consideration with congenital abnormali- ties is that they tend to be multiple. Further, each one is unique in its extent and severity. Exstrophy can involve the rectum and large bowel and coexist with hernias. The obvious bladder exstrophy seen at birth will prompt immediate action and a search for other anomalies. Diverticula are not visible and will be detected only if they cause trouble. They are usually found in an examination for the cause of recurring urinary infec- tions. X rays of the urinary system or a cystoscopy (examination with a telescope-like instrument) will identify them. Often, the two procedures are done together: a urologist will perform the cystoscopy, then a radiologist will instill a contrast agent into the bladder and take x rays. Treatment Surgery is necessary and can usually produce suc- cessful results. If possible, the surgery must be done within 48 hours of birth. Prior to surgery, the exposed organs must be protected and all related defects identi- fied and managed. Delay in the surgery leads to the frequent need to divert the urine into the bowel because the partially repaired bladder cannot control the flow. After surgery, the likelihood of infection requires monitoring. Alternative treatment After surgery ongoing precautions to reduce fre- quency of infection may need to be used. Cranberry juice has the ability to keep bacteria from adhering to the membranes and can help prevent infection when- ever there is increased risk. There are botanical and homeopathic treatments available, however consulta- tion by a trained practitioner is recommended before treatment. Prognosis With immediate surgery, three-quarters of patients can be successfully repaired. They will have control of their urine and no long-term consequences. The rate of infection is greater for those with congenital bladder anomalies, since any abnormality in the urinary system predisposes it to invasion by bacteria. Prevention Birth defects often have no precisely identified cause, therefore prevention is limited to general mea- sures such as early and continuous prenatal care, appro- priate nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle.

          "content": "Description The urogenital system, for some reason, is more likely than any other to have birth defects, and they can occur in endless variety. Ureters can be duplicated com- pletely or partially, they can be in the wrong place, they can be deformed, and they can end in the wrong place. The trouble these abnormalities bring is directly related to their effect on the flow of urine. As long as urine flows normally through them, and only in one direction, no harm is done. \u2022 Duplication of ureters is quite common, either in part or completely. Kidneys are sometimes duplicated as well. Someone may have four kidneys and four ureters or two kidneys, half of each drained by a separate ureter, or a sin- gle kidney with two, three, or four ureters attached. As long as urine can flow easily in the correct direction, such malformations may never be detected. If, however, one of the ureters has a dead end, a stricture or stenosis (narrow- ing), or a leaky ureterovesical valve (valve between the ureter and bladder), infection is the likely result. \u2022 Stricture or stenosis of a ureter prevents urine from flowing freely. Whenever flow is obstructed in the body\u2014urine, bile, mucus, or any other liquid\u2014infec- tion follows. Ureters can be obstructed anywhere along their course, though the ureterovesical valve is the most common place. \u2022 A ureter may have an ectopic (out of place) orifice (opening)\u2014it may enter the bladder, or even another structure, where it does not belong and therefore with- out an adequate valve to control reflux. \u2022 The primary ureter, or a duplicate, may not even reach the bladder, but rather terminate in a dead end. Urine will stagnate there and eventually cause infection. \u2022 A ureter can be perfectly normal but in the wrong place, such as behind the vena cava (the large vein in the mid- dle of the abdomen). A so-called retrocaval ureter may be pinched by the vena cava so that flow is hindered. Other aberrant locations may also lead to compression and impaired flow. Besides infection, urine that backs up will cause the ureter and the kidney to dilate. Eventually, the kidney will stop functioning because of the back pressure. This condition is called hydronephrosis\u2014a kidney swollen with urine. Causes and symptoms The causes of birth defects are multiple and often unknown. Furthermore, the precise cause of specific birth defects has only rarely been identified. Such is the case with congenital ureteral anomalies. KEY TERMS Congenital\u2014Present at birth. Contrast agent \u2014A chemical or other substance placed in the body to show structures that would not otherwise be visible on x ray or other imaging studies. Cystoscopy \u2014Looking into the urinary bladder with a thin telescope-like instrument. Ectopic\u2014Out of place. Septicemia \u2014A serious whole body infection spreading through the blood stream. Uretreovesical valve \u2014A sphincter (an opening controlled by a circular muscle), located where the ureter enters the bladder, that keeps urine from flowing backward toward the kidney. Urogenital\u2014Both the urinary system and the sex- ual organs, which form together in the developing embryo. Practically the only symptom generated by ureteral abnormalities is urinary tract infection. A lower tract infection\u2014in the bladder\u2014is called cystitis. In children, it may cause fever and systemic symptoms, but in adults it causes only cloudy, burning, and frequent urine. Upper tract infections, on the other hand, can be serious for both adults and children, causing high fevers, back pain, severe generalized discomfort, and even leading to kid- ney failure or septicemia (infection spreading throughout the body by way of the blood stream). In rare cases, urine from an ectopic ureter will bypass the bladder and dribble out of the bottom somewhere, through a natural orifice like the vagina or a completely separate unnatural opening. Diagnosis Serious or recurrent urinary infections will prompt a search for underlying abnormalities. Cystoscopy (look- ing into the bladder with a thin telescope-like instrument) and x rays with a contrast agent to illuminate the urinary system will usually identify the defect. Computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may provide additional informa- tion. Urine cultures to identify the infecting germs will be repeated frequently until the problem is corrected.

Jennifer Sisk Congenital amputation Definition Congenital amputation is the absence of a fetal limb or fetal part at birth. This condition may be the result of the constriction of fibrous bands within the membrane that surrounds the developing fetus (amniotic band syndrome) or the exposure to substances known to cause birth defects (teratogenic agents). Other factors, including genetics, may also play a role. Description An estimated one in 2,000 babies are born with all or part of a limb missing, ranging from a missing part of a finger to the absence of both arms and both legs. Con- genital amputation is the least common reason for amputation. However, there are occasional periods in history where the number of congenital amputations increased. For example, the thalidomide tragedy of the early 1960s occurred after pregnant mothers in western Europe were given a tranquilizer containing the drug. The result was a drastic increase in the number of babies born with deformed limbs. In this example, the birth defect usually presented itself as very small, deformed versions of normal limbs. More recently, birth defects as a result of radiation exposure near the site of the Cher- nobyl disaster in Russia have left numerous children with malformed or absent limbs. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of congenital amputations is unknown. However, according to the March of Dimes, most birth defects have one or more genetic factors and one or more environmental factors. It is also known that most birth defects occur in the first three months of preg- nancy, when the organs of the fetus are forming. Within these crucial first weeks, frequently prior to when a woman is aware of the pregnancy, the developing fetus is most susceptible to substances that can cause birth defects (teratogens). Exposure to teratogens can cause congenital amputation. In other cases, tight amniotic bands may constrict the developing fetus, preventing a limb from forming properly, if at all. It is estimated that this amniotic band syndrome occurs in between one in 12,000 and one in 15,000 live births. An infant with congenital amputation may be miss- ing an entire limb or just a portion of a limb. Congenital amputation resulting in the complete absence of a limb beyond a certain point (and leaving a stump) is called transverse deficiency or amelia. Longitudinal deficien- cies occur when a specific part of a limb is missing; for example, when the fibula bone in the lower leg is miss- ing, but the rest of the leg is intact. Phocomelia is the condition in which only a mid-portion of a limb is miss- ing, as when the hands or feet are attached directly to the trunk. Diagnosis Many cases of congenital amputation are not diag- nosed until the baby is born. Ultrasound examinations may reveal the absence of a limb in some developing fetuses, but routine ultrasounds may not pick up signs of more subtle defects. However, if a doctor suspects that the fetus is at risk for developing a limb deficiency (for example, if the mother has been exposed to radiation), a more detailed ultrasound examination may be performed. Treatment Successful treatment of a child with congenital amputation involves an entire medical team, including a pediatrician, an orthopedist, a psychiatrist or psycholo- gist, a prosthetist (an expert in making prosthetics, or artificial limbs), a social worker, and occupational and physical therapists. The accepted method of treatment is to fit the child early with a functional prosthesis because this leads to normal development and less wasting away (atrophy) of the muscles of the limbs present. However, some parents and physicians believe that the child should be allowed to learn to play and perform tasks without a prosthesis, if possible. When the child is older, he or she can be involved in the decision of whether or not to be fitted for a prosthesis. Recently, there have been cases in which physicians have detected amniotic band constriction interfering with limb development fairly early in its course. In 1997, doc- tors at the Florida Institute for Fetal Diagnosis and Ther- apy reported two cases in which minimally invasive surgery freed constricting amniotic bands and preserved the affected limbs. Alternative treatment Prevention of birth defects begins with building the well-being of the mother before pregnancy. Prenatal care GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 887 Congenital amputation",

          "content": "ratio of UTIs in children younger than 12 months is 4:1 because of the high rate of birth defects in the urinary tract of male infants. In adult life, the male/female ratio of UTIs is 1:50. After age 50, however, the incidence among males increases due to prostate disorders. Cystitis in women Cystitis is a common female problem. It is estimated that 50% of adult women experience at least one episode of dysuria (painful urination); half of these patients have a bacterial UTI. Between 2\u20135% of women\u2019s visits to pri- mary care doctors are for UTI symptoms. About 90% of UTIs in women are uncomplicated but recurrent. Cystitis in men UTIs are uncommon in younger and middle-aged men, but may occur as complications of bacterial infec- tions of the kidney or prostate gland. Cystitis in children In children, cystitis is often caused by congenital abnormalities (present at birth) of the urinary tract. Vesi- coureteral reflux is a condition in which the child can- not completely empty the bladder. It allows urine to remain in or flow backward (reflux) into the partially empty bladder. Causes and symptoms The causes of cystitis vary according to sex because of the differences in anatomical structure of the urinary tract. Females Most bladder infections in women are so-called ascending infections, which means that they are caused by disease agents traveling upward through the urethra to the bladder. The relative shortness of the female urethra (1.2\u20132 in in length) makes it easy for bacteria to gain entry to the bladder and multiply. The most common bac- teria associated with UTIs in women include Escherichia coli (about 80% of cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species. Risk fac- tors for UTIs in women include: \u2022 Sexual intercourse. The risk of infection increases if the woman has multiple partners. \u2022 Use of a diaphragm for contraception \u2022 An abnormally short urethra \u2022 Diabetes or chronic dehydration \u2022 The absence of a specific enzyme (fucosyltransferase) in vaginal secretions. The lack of this enzyme makes it easier for the vagina to harbor bacteria that cause UTIs. \u2022 Inadequate personal hygiene. Bacteria from fecal matter or vaginal discharges can enter the female urethra because its opening is very close to the vagina and anus. \u2022 History of previous UTIs. About 80% of women with cystitis develop recurrences within two years. The early symptoms of cystitis in women are dysuria, or pain on urination; urgency, or a sudden strong desire to urinate; and increased frequency of uri- nation. About 50% of female patients experience fever, pain in the lower back or flanks, nausea and vomiting , or shaking chills. These symptoms indicate pyelonephri- tis, or spread of the infection to the upper urinary tract. Males Most UTIs in adult males are complications of kid- ney or prostate infections. They are usually associated with a tumor or kidney stones that block the flow of urine and are often persistent infections caused by drug- resistant organisms. UTIs in men are most likely to be caused by E. coli or another gram-negative bacterium. S. saprophyticus, which is the second most common cause of UTIs in women, rarely causes infections in men. Risk factors for UTIs in men include: \u2022 Lack of circumcision. The foreskin can harbor bacteria that cause UTIs. \u2022 Urinary catheterization. The longer the period of catheterization, the higher the risk of UTIs. The symptoms of cystitis and pyelonephritis in men are the same as in women. Hemorrhagic cystitis Hemorrhagic cystitis, which is marked by large quantities of blood in the urine, is caused by an acute bacterial infection of the bladder. In some cases, hemor- rhagic cystitis is a side effect of radiation therapy or treatment with cyclophosphamide. Hemorrhagic cystitis in children is associated with adenovirus type 11. Diagnosis When cystitis is suspected, the doctor will first examine the patient\u2019s abdomen and lower back, to evalu- ate unusual enlargements of the kidneys or swelling of the bladder. In small children, the doctor will check for fever, abdominal masses, and a swollen bladder. The next step in diagnosis is collection of a urine sample. The procedure differs somewhat for women and men. Laboratory testing of urine samples can now be performed with dipsticks that indicate immune system responses to infection, as well as with microscopic analysis of samples. Normal human urine is sterile. The GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 992 Cystitis",

About 30\u201350% of all children with Down syn- drome are found to have heart defects. A number of dif- ferent heart defects are common in Down syndrome, including abnormal openings (holes) in the walls that separate the heart\u2019s chambers (atrial septal defect, ven- tricular septal defect). These result in abnormal patterns of blood flow within the heart. The abnormal blood flow often means that less oxygen is sent into circulation throughout the body. Another heart defect that occurs in Down syndrome is called Tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot consists of a hole in the heart, along with three other major heart defects. Malformations of the gastrointestinal tract are pre- sent in about 5\u20137% of children with Down syndrome. The most common malformation is a narrowed, obstruct- ed duodenum (the part of the intestine into which the stomach empties). This disorder, called duodenal atresia, interferes with the baby\u2019s milk or formula leaving the stomach and entering the intestine for digestion. The baby often vomits forcibly after feeding, and cannot gain weight appropriately until the defect is repaired. Other medical conditions that occur in patients with Down syndrome include an increased chance of develop- ing infections, especially ear infections and pneumonia; certain kidney disorders; thyroid disease (especially low or hypothyroid); hearing loss; vision impairment requir- ing glasses (corrective lenses); and a 20-times greater chance of developing leukemia (a blood disorder). Development in a baby and child with Down syn- drome occurs at a much slower than normal rate. Because of weak, floppy muscles (hypotonia), babies learn to sit up, crawl, and walk much later than their nor- mal peers. Talking is also quite delayed. The level of mental retardation is considered to be mild-to-moderate in Down syndrome. The actual IQ range of Down syn- drome children is quite varied, but the majority of such children are in what is sometimes known as the trainable range. This means that most people with Down syn- drome can be trained to do regular self-care tasks, func- tion in a socially appropriate manner in a normal home environment, and even hold simple jobs. As people with Down syndrome age, they face an increased chance of developing the brain disease called Alzheimer\u2019s (sometimes referred to as dementia or senility). Most people have a six in 100 risk of develop- ing Alzheimer\u2019s, but people with Down syndrome have a 25 in 100 chance of the disease. Alzheimer\u2019s disease causes the brain to shrink and to break down. The num- ber of brain cells decreases, and abnormal deposits and structural arrangements occur. This process results in a loss of brain functioning. People with Alzheimer\u2019s have strikingly faulty memories. Over time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease will lapse into an increasingly unre- sponsive state. Some researchers have shown that even Down syndrome patients who do not appear to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease have the same changes occurring to the structures and cells of their brains. As people with Down syndrome age, they also have an increased chance of developing a number of other ill- nesses, including cataracts, thyroid problems, diabetes, and seizure disorders. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually suspected at birth, when the characteristic physical signs of Down syndrome are noted. Once this suspicion has been raised, genetic test- ing (chromosome analysis) can be undertaken in order to verify the presence of the disorder. This testing is usually done on a blood sample, although chromosome analysis can also be done on other types of tissue, including skin. The cells to be studied are prepared in a laboratory. Chemical stain is added to make the characteristics of the cells and the chromosomes stand out. Chemicals are added to prompt the cells to go through normal develop- ment, up to the point where the chromosomes are most visible, prior to cell division. At this point, they are examined under a microscope and photographed. The photograph is used to sort the different sizes and shapes of chromosomes into pairs. In most cases of Down syn- drome, one extra chromosome 21 will be revealed. The final result of such testing, with the photographed chro- mosomes paired and organized by shape and size, is called the individual\u2019s karyotype.

Congenital bladder anomalies Definition The two most common congenital bladder abnor- malities are exstrophy and congenital diverticula. An exstrophic bladder is one that is open to the outside and turned inside-out, so that its inside is visible at birth, pro- truding from the lower abdomen. A diverticulum is an extension of a hollow organ, usually shaped like a pouch with a narrow opening. Description During fetal development, folds enclose tissues and organs and eventually fuse at the edges to form sealed compartments. Both in the front and the back, folds eventually become major body structures. In the back, the entire spinal column folds in like a pipe wrapped in a pillow. In the front, the entire lower urinary system is folded in. \u2022 Exstrophy of the bladder represents a failure of this folding process to complete itself, so the organs form with more or less of their front side missing and open to the outside. At the same time, the front of the pelvic bone is widely separated. The abdominal wall is open, too. In fact, the defect often extends all the way to the penis in the male or splits the clitoris in the female. \u2022 A congenital bladder diverticulum represent an area of weakness in the bladder wall through which extrudes some of the lining of the bladder. (A small balloon squeezed in a fist will create diverticula-like effect between the fingers.) Bladder diverticula may be multi- ple, and they often occur at the ureterovesical junc- tion\u2014the entrance of the upper urinary system into the bladder. In this location, they may cause urine to reflux into the ureter and kidney, leading to infection and pos- sible kidney damage. Causes and symptoms As with many birth defects, the causes are not well known. Lack of prenatal care and nutrition has been linked to many birth defects; however, beyond the avoid- ance of known teratogens (anything that can cause a birth defect), there is little prevention possible. Exstrophy is rare, occurring in about one in 40,000 births. Diverticula are more common, but less serious. If left untreated, the patient with bladder exstrophy will have no control over urination and is more likely to develop bladder cancer . Diverticula, particularly if it causes urine reflux, may lead to chronic infection and its subsequent consequences. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2888 Congenital bladder anomalies",

Congenital lobar emphysema is more common in boys than in girls. Each person has two lungs, right and left. The right lung is divided into three sections, called lobes, and the left lung into two lobes. Congenital lobar emphysema usually affects only one lobe, and this is usually an upper lobe. It occurs most frequently in the left upper lobe, fol- lowed by the right middle lobe. Causes and symptoms The cause of congenital lobar emphysema often can- not be identified. The airway may be obstructed or the infant\u2019s lungs may not have developed properly. Congen- ital lobar emphysema is almost never of genetic origin. Symptoms of congenital lobar emphysema include: \u2022 shortness of breath \u2022 wheezing \u2022 lips and fingernail beds that have a bluish tinge Diagnosis Congenital lobar emphysema is usually identified within the first two weeks of the infant\u2019s life. It is diag- nosed by respiratory symptoms and a chest x ray, which shows the over-inflation of the affected lobe and may show a blocked air passage. Treatment For infants with no, mild, or intermittent symptoms, no treatment is necessary. For more serious cases of con- genital lobar emphysema, surgery is necessary, usually a lobectomy to remove the affected lung lobe.

Description The duodenum is the first part of the intestine, into which the stomach, the gall bladder, and the pancreas empty their contents. The pylorus connects the duode- num with the stomach and contains the valve that regu- lates stomach emptying. Obstruction usually occurs right at this outlet, so that the gall bladder and pancreas are unable to drain their secretions without hindrance. Causes and symptoms Obstruction of the duodenum occurs in adults and infants, each for a different set of reasons. In adults, the usual cause is a peptic ulcer of such antiquity that repeat- ed cycles of injury and scarring have narrowed the pas- sageway. Medical treatment of ulcers has progressed to the point where such obstinate ulcer disease is rarely seen any more. In infants, the conditions are congeni- tal\u2014either the channel is underdeveloped or the pylorus is overdeveloped. The first type is called duodenal hypoplasia and the second is termed hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. In rare cases, the channel may be miss- ing altogether, a condition called duodenal atresia. To say that these anomalies are congenital is not to say their cause is understood. As with most birth defects, the spe- cific cause is not known. Food that cannot exit the stomach in the forward direction will return whence it came. V omiting is the constant symptom of duodenal obstruction. It may be preceded by indigestion and nausea as the stomach attempts to squeeze its contents through an ever narrow- ing outlet. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis appears soon after birth. The infant will vomit feedings, lose weight, and be restless and irritable. Diagnosis X rays taken with contrast material in the stomach readily demonstrate the site of the blockage and often the ulcer that caused it. Gastroscopy is another way to evalu- ate the problem. In infants, x rays may not be necessary to detect pyloric stenosis. It is often possible to feel the enlarged pylorus, like an olive, deep under the ribs and see the stomach rippling as it labors to force food through.

Judith Turner Diaphragm (birth control) Definition Diaphragms are dome-shaped barrier methods of contraception that block sperm from entering the uterus. They are made of latex (rubber) and formed like a shal- low cup. Since vaginas vary in size, each patient will need to be fitted by a doctor or nurse with a diaphragm that conforms to the shape and contour of the vagina as well as the strength of the muscles in the vaginal walls. Diaphragms must be used with spermicidal cream or jelly. The device should cause no discomfort, and neither the woman nor her partner should feel that it is there. Purpose The purpose of a diaphragm is to prevent access to the womb (uterus) by the sperm and thus prevent concep- tion. The level of effectiveness is about 95%. Precautions Each client will undergo a physical examinationand a Pap smear. If these are normal, the physician will fit the patient for the device and give instructions on how to insert, remove, and clean the object. She will also be taught the signs and symptoms of potential complications. KEY TERMS Dermatitis\u2014Inflammation of the skin. Description Prior to insertion, the inside of the dome and the rim are covered with a thick layer (perhaps a tablespoon) of a spermicide that is compatible with the diaphragm being used. The domed area covers the opening into the uterus (cervix) and keeps the spermicide in place. As a result, any sperm that might get under the diaphragm will be destroyed. Diaphragms may be inserted two to three hours prior to intercourse, and must be left in place for six to eight hours following sexual relations. During this time the woman may not swim, bathe, or douche, but she may shower. If she desires to have intercourse again before the six to eight hours have passed, the diaphragm should not be removed. Instead, an applicator full of spermicide should be deposited into the vagina. A diaphragm will last for a year or more. It should be examined weekly for holes. This can be done by hold- ing it up to the light or filling it with water. Preparation Before inserting the diaphragm, the woman should empty her bladder and wash her hands with soap and water. The device should be checked for leaks by filling it with water or holding it up to the light. A spermicidal jelly is then applied to the inside and outside, and espe- cially around the rim. While standing with one foot ele- vated on a chair or step, lying down, or squatting, the woman folds the diaphragm inward toward the middle and inserts it into the vagina as far as it will go. Aftercare When removed, the diaphragm should be washed with a mild soap and water. After being dried, it can be dusted with corn starch before being returned to its con- tainer. The diaphragm should always be stored away from sunlight and heat in a cool, dry place. It should not be washed with harsh or perfumed soaps or used with perfumed powders because either of these substances can damage the diaphragm. Risks Although rare, wearing the diaphragm longer than the recommended time can result in toxic shock syn- drome. The signs and symptoms of this serious illness include sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness , faintness, weakness, aching muscles and joints, and rash. The doctor must be notified immediately if any of these conditions appear.

To be effective, condoms must be removed carefully so as not to \u201cspill\u201d the contents into the vaginal canal. Con- doms that leak or break do not provide protection against pregnancy or disease. If used correctly, male condoms have an effective- ness rate of about 90% for preventing pregnancy, but this rate can be increased to about 99% if used with a spermicide. (Several types of spermicides are available; they can be purchased in the form of contraceptive creams and jellies, foams, or films.) Benefits associated with this type of contraceptive device include easy avail- ability (no prescription is required), convenience of use, and lack of serious side effects. The primary disadvan- tage is that sexual activity must be interrupted in order to put the condom on. Female condoms, when used correctly and at every instance of intercourse, were shown to prevent pregnancy in over 95% of women surveyed over the course of six months. When used inconsistently, the female condom was shown to have a failure rate of 21% in the same study. One benefit of the female condom is that it may be inserted immediately before sexual intercourse or up to eight hours prior, so that sexual activity does not need to be interrupted for its insertion. One study performed by a manufacturer of the female condom indicated that 50\u201375% of couples in numerous countries found the bar- rier acceptable for use.

A similar 1993 study showed that out of 171 couples with one HIV-positive partner, all but two individuals were protected against HIV transmission with condom use. In addition to HIV , condoms provide effective transmission against gonor- rhea, chlamydia, syphilis, chancroid, and trichomonia- sis. A measure of protection is also provided against hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Before purchasing a condom, check the expiration date. Prior to use, examine the condom for holes. If a lubricant is going to be used, it should be water solu- ble because petroleum jellies, such as Vaseline, and other oil based lubricants can weaken latex. It is also important to note that condoms made from animal tis- sue or plastic are not recommended as a protection against STDs.

If the urinary stream becomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad- der may cause severe discomfort, a condition called acute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad- der can easily become infected. A burning feeling during urination and fever are clues that infection may have developed. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it may increase pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus- es permanent kidney damage. Diagnosis When a man\u2019s symptoms point to BPH, the first thing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal examination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel whether\u2014and how much\u2014the prostate is enlarged. A smooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis- tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer . The next step is a blood test for a substance called prostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30\u201350% of men with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This does not mean cancer by any means, but other measures are needed to make sure that the prostate enlargement is in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate, which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, can show whether it is enlarged and may show that cancer is present. If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate raises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec- ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. This is usually done using a lance-like instrument that is inserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and, guided by the physcian\u2019s finger, obtains six to eight pieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination. If cancer is present, the prognosis and treatment are changed accordingly.

Another and very simple test for obstruc- tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter, which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain\u2014 though invasive\u2014way of confirming obstruction from an enlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrument called a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not often necessary. It is routine to check a urine sample for an increased number of white blood cells, which may mean there is infection of the bladder or kidneys. The same sample may be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus- ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best.

Purpose Cystectomy is performed to treat cancer of the blad- der. Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat bladder cancer. Surgery is used to remove cancer when it is in the muscle of the bladder. Precautions Cystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not be appropriate for patients with superficial tumors that respond to more conservative treatment. Description Cystectomy is a major surgical operation. The patient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision is made across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located, tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad- der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. The bladder and associated organs are removed. In men, the prostate is removed with the bladder. In women, the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina are removed with the bladder. The bladder collects urine from the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since the bladder is removed, a new method must be created to remove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine is removed, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. The other end is used to form a stoma, an opening through the abdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con- nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys now flows down the ureters, into the tube, and through the stoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine. Preparation The medical team will discuss the procedure and tell the patient where the stoma will appear and what it will look like. The patient receives instruction on caring for a stoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated. A period of fasting and an enema may be required. KEY TERMS Ureters \u2014Tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urine produced by the kidneys passes through the ureters to the bladder. Aftercare After the operation, the patient is given fluid-based nutrition until the intestines being to function normally again. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the incision sites. The nature of the organs removed mean that there will be major lifestyle changes for the person undergoing the operation. Men will become impotent because nerves controlling penile erection are cut during removal of the bladder. In women, infertility is a conse- quence because the ovaries and uterus are removed. However, most women who undergo cystectomy are postmenopausal and past their childbearing years. Both men and women are fitted with an external bag that connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bag is generally worn around the waist under the clothing. It takes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing the bag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it is produced, essentially continuously. The stoma must be treated properly to ensure that it does not become infect- ed or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for their stoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust- ment to the major change in life style created by the stoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this by discussion with their physician. Risks As with any major surgery, there is a risk of infec- tion; in this case, infection of the intestine is especially dangerous as it can lead to peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen). Normal results The bladder is successfully removed and a stoma created. Intestinal function returns to normal and the patient learns proper care of the stoma and bag. He or she adjusts to lifestyle changes and returns to a normal rou- tine of work and recreation, some sports excluded. Abnormal results The patient develops an infection at the incision site.

If the urinary stream becomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad- der may cause severe discomfort, a condition called acute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad- der can easily become infected. A burning feeling during urination and fever are clues that infection may have developed. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it may increase pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus- es permanent kidney damage. Diagnosis When a man\u2019s symptoms point to BPH, the first thing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal examination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel whether\u2014and how much\u2014the prostate is enlarged. A smooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis- tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer . The next step is a blood test for a substance called prostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30\u201350% of men with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This does not mean cancer by any means, but other measures are needed to make sure that the prostate enlargement is in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate, which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, can show whether it is enlarged and may show that cancer is present. If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate raises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec- ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. This is usually done using a lance-like instrument that is inserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and, guided by the physcian\u2019s finger, obtains six to eight pieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination. If cancer is present, the prognosis and treatment are changed accordingly. A catheter placed through the urethra and into the bladder can show how much urine remains in the bladder after the patient urinates\u2014a measure of how severe the obstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc- tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter, which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain\u2014 though invasive\u2014way of confirming obstruction from an enlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrument called a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not often necessary. It is routine to check a urine sample for an increased number of white blood cells, which may mean there is infection of the bladder or kidneys. The same sample may be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus- ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best. The state of the kidneys may be checked in two ways: imaging by either ultrasound or injecting a dye (the intra- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1202 Enlarged prostate Enlarged prostate gland Ureter Prostate gland Urine retention in bladder Constricted urethra Normal sized prostate gland Enlarged prostate gland An enlarged prostate is a non-cancerous condition in which the narrowing of the urethra makes the elimination of urine more difficult.

Purpose Cystectomy is performed to treat cancer of the blad- der. Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat bladder cancer. Surgery is used to remove cancer when it is in the muscle of the bladder. Precautions Cystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not be appropriate for patients with superficial tumors that respond to more conservative treatment. Description Cystectomy is a major surgical operation. The patient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision is made across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located, tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad- der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. The bladder and associated organs are removed. In men, the prostate is removed with the bladder. In women, the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina are removed with the bladder. The bladder collects urine from the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since the bladder is removed, a new method must be created to remove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine is removed, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. The other end is used to form a stoma, an opening through the abdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con- nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys now flows down the ureters, into the tube, and through the stoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine. Preparation The medical team will discuss the procedure and tell the patient where the stoma will appear and what it will look like. The patient receives instruction on caring for a stoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated. A period of fasting and an enema may be required. KEY TERMS Ureters \u2014Tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urine produced by the kidneys passes through the ureters to the bladder. Aftercare After the operation, the patient is given fluid-based nutrition until the intestines being to function normally again. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the incision sites. The nature of the organs removed mean that there will be major lifestyle changes for the person undergoing the operation. Men will become impotent because nerves controlling penile erection are cut during removal of the bladder. In women, infertility is a conse- quence because the ovaries and uterus are removed. However, most women who undergo cystectomy are postmenopausal and past their childbearing years. Both men and women are fitted with an external bag that connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bag is generally worn around the waist under the clothing. It takes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing the bag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it is produced, essentially continuously. The stoma must be treated properly to ensure that it does not become infect- ed or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for their stoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust- ment to the major change in life style created by the stoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this by discussion with their physician. Risks As with any major surgery, there is a risk of infec- tion; in this case, infection of the intestine is especially dangerous as it can lead to peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen). Normal results The bladder is successfully removed and a stoma created. Intestinal function returns to normal and the patient learns proper care of the stoma and bag. He or she adjusts to lifestyle changes and returns to a normal rou- tine of work and recreation, some sports excluded. Abnormal results The patient develops an infection at the incision site.

Under 32 weeks, the baby is given blood trans- fusions while still in the mother\u2019s uterus. There are two techniques that are used to deliver a blood transfusion to a baby before birth. In the first, a needle is inserted through the mother\u2019s abdomen and uterus, and into the baby\u2019s abdomen. Red blood cells injected into the baby\u2019s abdominal cavity are absorbed into its bloodstream. In early pregnancy or if the baby\u2019s bilirubin levels are gravely high, cordocentesis is per- formed. This procedure involves sliding a very fine nee- dle through the mother\u2019s abdomen and, guided by ultra- sound, into a vein in the umbilical cord to inject red blood cells directly into the baby\u2019s bloodstream. After birth, the severity of the baby\u2019s symptoms are assessed. One or more transfusions may be necessary to treat anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and bleeding. Hyper- bilirubinemia is also treated with phototherapy, a treat- ment in which the baby is placed under a special light. This light causes changes in how the bilirubin molecule is shaped, which makes it easier to excrete. The baby may also receive oxygen and intravenous fluids contain- ing electrolytes or drugs to treat other symptoms. Prognosis In many cases of blood type incompatibility, the symptoms of erythroblastosis fetalis are prevented with careful monitoring and blood type screening. Treatment of minor symptoms is typically successful and the baby will not suffer long-term problems. Nevertheless, erythroblastosis is a very serious con- dition for approximately 4,000 babies annually. In about 15% of cases, the baby is severely affected and dies before birth. Babies who survive pregnancy may develop kernicterus, which can lead to deafness, speech prob- lems, cerebral palsy, or mental retardation . Extended hydrops fetalis can inhibit lung growth and contribute to heart failure . These serious complications are life threatening, but with good medical treatment, the fatality rate is very low. According to the U.S. Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention, there were 21 infant deaths in the United States during 1996 that were attributable to hemolytic disease (erythroblastosis fetalis) and jaundice. Prevention With any pregnancy, whether it results in a live birth, miscarriage , stillbirth , or abortion, blood typing is a universal precaution against blood compatibility disease. Blood types cannot be changed, but adequate forewarn- ing allows precautions and treatments that limit the dan- ger to unborn babies. If an Rh-negative woman gives birth to an Rh-posi- tive baby, she is given an injection of immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody protein, within 72 hours of the birth. The immunoglobulin destroys any fetal blood cells in her bloodstream before her immune system can react to them. In cases where this precaution is not taken, anti- bodies are created and future pregnancies may be com- plicated.

The rate is an indication of inflammation and increases in many diseases. Purpose ESR is increased in rheumatoid diseases, most infec- tions, and in cancer. An advanced rate doesn\u2019t diagnose a specific disease, but it does indicate that an underlying disease may be present. A physician can use ESR to monitor a person with an associated disease. When the disease worsens, the ESR increases; when the disease improves, the ESR decreases. The ESR doesn\u2019t always follow the course of cancer. ESR is called an acute-phase reactant test, meaning that it reacts to acute conditions in the body, such as infection or trauma. The rate increase follows a rise in temperature and white blood cells count, peaks after sev- eral days, and usually lasts longer than the elevated tem- perature or white blood cells count.

          "content": "Treatment Bowel obstruction requires a surgeon, sometimes immediately. Newer surgical techniques constantly improve the outcome, but obstruction is a mechanical problem that needs a mechanical solution. Most adults who come to surgery for obstruction have suffered for years from peptic ulcer disease. They will usually benefit from ulcer surgery at the same time their obstruction is relieved. The surgeon will therefore select a procedure that combines relief of obstruction with remedy for ulcer disease. There are many choices. In fact, even without obstruction, functional considerations require ulcer surgery to include enhancement of stomach emptying. To treat an infant with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, some surgeons have had success with forceful balloon dilation of the pylorus done through a gastroscope, but the standard procedure is to cut across the overdeveloped circular muscle that is constricting the stomach outlet. There are reports of infant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis remitting without surgery following a very careful feed- ing schedule, but mortality is unacceptably high. Prognosis A functioning and unrestricted intestine is a prereq- uisite for living independent of the most advanced and continuous medical care available.

          "content": "Treatment Infants with esophageal atresia are unlikely to survive without surgery to reconnect the esophagus. The procedure is done as soon as possible; however, prematurity, the presence of other birth defects, or complications of apira- tion pneumonia may delay surgery. Once diagnosed, the baby will be fed intraveneously until he or she has recov- ered sufficiently from the operation. Mucus and saliva will also be continuously removed via a catheter until recovery has occured. When surgery is performed, the esophagus is reconnected and, if neccessary, separated from the trachea. If the two ends of the esophagus are too far apart to be reat- tached, tissue from the large intestine is used to join them. Prognosis Surgery to correct esophageal atresia is usually suc- cessful. Post-operative complications may include diffi- culty swallowing, since the esophagus may not contract efficiently, and gastrointestinal reflux, in which the acidic contents of stomach back up into the lower part of the esophagus, possibly causing ulcers.

Fistula\u2014Unnatural connection between two hol- low organs or one organ and the outside. along which food and liquid travel from the throat to the stomach. Description Esophageal cancer usually originates in the inner layers of the lining of the esophagus and grows outward. In time, the tumor can obstruct the passage of food and liquid, making swallowing painful and difficult. Since most patients are not diagnosed until the late stages of the disease, esophageal cancer is associated with poor quality of life and low survival rates. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer, accounting for 95% of all esophageal cancers worldwide. The esophagus is nor- mally lined with thin, flat squamous cells that resemble tiny roof shingles. Squamous cell carcinoma can develop at any point along the esophagus but is most common in the middle portion. Adenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carci- noma as the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United States. Adenocarcinoma originates in glandu- lar tissue not normally present in the lining of the esoph- agus. Before adenocarcinoma can develop, glandular cells must replace a section of squamous cells. This occurs in Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a precancerous condition in which chronic acid reflux from the stomach stimulates a transformation in cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus. A very small fraction of esophageal cancers are melanomas, sarcomas, or lymphomas. There is great variability in the incidence of esophageal cancer with regard to geography, ethnicity, and gender. The overall incidence is increasing. About 13,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year. During the same 12-month period, 12,000 people die of this disease. It strikes between five and ten North Americans per 100,000. In some areas of China the cancer is endemic. Squamous cell carcinoma usually occurs in the sixth or seventh decade of life, with a greater incidence in African-Americans than in others. Adenocarcinoma develops earlier and is much more common in white patients. In general, esophageal cancer occurs more fre- quently in men than in women. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown, although many investigators believe that chronic irrita- tion of the esophagus is a major culprit. Most of the iden- tified risk factors represent a form of chronic irritation. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1239 Esophageal cancer",

For this procedure a tube flexible tube is inserted through the nose, down the throat, and into the stomach. The contents of the stomach are then suc- tioned out through the tube.

An antidote is another drug that counteracts or blocks the overdose drug.

Naloxone is an anti-nar- cotic drug that is given to counteract narcotic poison- ing. Nalmefen or methadone may also be used. \u2022 Psychiatric evaluation may be recommended if the drug overdose was taken deliberately. Prognosis While many victims of drug overdose recover with- out long term effects, there can be serious consequences. Some drug overdoses cause the failure of major organs like the kidneys or liver, or failure of whole systems like the respiratory or circulatory systems. Patients who sur- vive drug overdose may need kidney dialysis, kidney or liver transplant, or ongoing care as a result of heart fail- ure, stroke, or coma. Death can occur in almost any drug overdose situation, particularly if treatment is not started immediately. Prevention To protect children from accidental drug overdose, all medications should be stored in containers with child resistant caps. All drugs should be out of sight and out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Pre- scription medications should be used according to direc- tions and only by the person whose name is on the label.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD Esophageal ulcers see Ulcers (digestive) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Definition An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterolo- gy (the medical study of the stomach and intestines) is a thin, flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is limited to the examination of the inside of the gastrointestinal tract\u2019s upper portion, it is called upper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). With the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes- tine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent- ly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam. Purpose EGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as: \u2022 upper abdominal or chest pain \u2022 nausea or vomiting \u2022 difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) \u2022 bleeding from the upper intestinal tract \u2022 anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat certain conditions, such as an area of narrowing or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract Upper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for detecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used to diagnose early cancer and can frequently determine whether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Biopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or \u201csus- picious\u201d areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol- ogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc- tion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of cancer or infections. When treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti- nal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo- scope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), or remove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). In addition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treated by a number of endoscopic techniques. Recent studies have shown the usefulness of endo- scopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom- ach. This is done either with injection of certain materi- als (like alcohol), or with the use of instruments (like lasers) that burn the tumor. Other techniques combining medications and lasers also show promise. Precautions Patients should inquire as to the doctor\u2019s expertise with these procedures, especially when therapy is the main goal. The doctor should be informed of any aller- gies, medication use, and medical problems. Description First, a \u201ctopical\u201d (local) medication to numb the gag reflex is given either by spray or is gargled. Patients are usually sedated for the procedure (though not always) by injection of medications into a vein. The endoscopist then has the patient swallow the scope, which is passed through the upper gastrointestinal tract. The lens or cam- era at the end of the instrument allows the endoscopist to examine each portion of the upper gastrointestinal tract; photos can be taken for reference. Air is pumped in through the instrument to allow proper observation. Biopsies and other procedures can be performed without any significant discomfort.

A loop colostomy is most often performed for creation of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured. Preparation As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be required to sign a consent form after the procedure is explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along with various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG), may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi- ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist, who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen for the stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy management. In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least the day before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid- night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations (GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte- ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec- tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery to remove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom- iting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, giving more space in the surgical field and decreasing chances of accidental injury. Aftercare Post-operative care for the patient with a new colos- tomy, as with those who have had any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperature.

          "content": "Description The nasal septum is composed of two parts. Toward the back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, but further forward the bone becomes cartilage. With one finger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bent back and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis- placed to one side, it will impede the flow of air and mucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat- ed septum, can cause symptoms and disease. Causes and symptoms A deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor- mal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow- ing of the nasal passageway that it causes will threaten the drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which must pass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicine that when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus from the sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results. People with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater risk of obstruction because their nasal passageways are already narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them. The result is sinusitis, which can be acute and severe or chronic and lingering. Diagnosis It is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more difficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. It is common for a patient to complain that he/she can breathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis is easy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring, sleep apnea, and other breathing disorders. Treatment The definitive treatment is surgical repositioning of the septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixing it in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink the membranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista- mines, nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat- ments may also be temporarily beneficial. Alternative treatment As a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help- ful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent- ing drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hot peppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears and discharge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even more effective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often done using a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is poured into one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril. Then, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies are all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correct the problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflated balloon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a large enough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be an alternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in the nasospecific procedure is necessary. Prognosis Surgical repair is curative and carries little risk. Chronic infection can be painful and lead to complica- tions until it is resolved. If there is continued obstruction, the infection will very likely return. Prevention Avoidance of virus colds, airborne dusts, air pollu- tion, and known allergens will minimize the irritation and swelling of the membranes lining the nasal passages.

McCartney, MD Colon therapy see Colonic irrigation Colonic irrigation Definition Colonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy of the colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply colonic. It is the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal- lons of water through it with the use of special equipment. It is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not just the lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact- ed fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites that often build up over the passage of time. It is a procedure that should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner. Purpose Anyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping pains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list of bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable bowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic- ular, cancer patients are often advised to undertake a course of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part of their treatment. When a biological cancer therapy begins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerous mass, it is essential that speedy and effective elimination of the resulting toxins is achieved. Colon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and alternative practitioners insist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce- dures. Providing that care is taken to replace the natural organisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefits can be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter- native practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowel is the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it clean will be an effective protection against this. Removing large amounts of toxic matter relieves the patient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms such as arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis, and a host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga- tion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug- gish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapy treatments over time. In addition, removing the layer of fecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu- als allows improved assimilation of the nutrients from foods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and other nutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition- ers consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel to be essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Description Origins Cleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy is not a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have been used successfully for decades to relieve chronic toxicity and even acute cases of toxemia. Over time, many people develop a thick layer of fecal matter that coats their colon. It hardens and becomes impacted, reducing the efficiency of the bowel, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 854 Colonic irrigation",

Clinical evaluation is aimed at distinguishing those patients who require immediate diagnostic work-ups from those who can safely benefit from more conservative initial treat- ment. Some of the latter may require only reassurance, dietary modifications, or antacid use. Medications to block production of stomach acids, prokinate agents, or antibiotic treatment may be considered. Further diagnos- tic investigation is indicated if there is severe abdominal pain, pain radiating to the back, unexplained weight loss, difficulty swallowing, a palpable mass, or anemia.

When present, however, symptoms of the infection begin approximately two weeks after ingesting the pin- worm eggs. The main symptom is itching around the anus. Because the itching intensifies at night, when the female worms comes to the anus to lay eggs, it often leads to disrupted sleep and irritability. Poor sleeping at night in small children can be related to pinworms. Occa- sionally, the itching causes some bleeding and bruising in the region, and secondary bacterial infections can occur. In females, the itching may spread to the vagina and sometimes causes an infection of the vaginal region (vaginitis). Enterobiasis usually lasts one to two months. Diagnosis First, a physician will rule out other potential causes of the itching, such as hemorrhoids , lice, or fungal or bacterial infection. Once these have been ruled out, an accurate diagnosis of enterobiasis will require that either the eggs or the adult worms are detected. Rarely, the adult worms are seen as thin, yellowish-white threads, about 0.4 in (1 cm) long, in the stools of the infected person. Usually, an hour or so after the individual goes to sleep, the adult female worms may be seen moving around lay- ing eggs if a flashlight is shone at the rectal area. An easier method is to observe the eggs under the microscope. In order to collect a specimen for laboratory diagnosis, the physician may provide a paddle with a sticky adhesive on one side, or an individual may be instructed to place a piece of shiny cellophane tape sticky side down against the anal opening. The best time to per- form this test is at night or as soon as the individual wakes up in the morning, before having a bowel move- ment or taking a bath or shower. The pinworm eggs will stick to the tape, which can then be placed on a specimen KEY TERMS Anus\u2014The opening through which feces are elim- inated.

When under a microscope in the laboratory, the eggs will be clearly visible. Treatment In order to treat the disease, either mebendazole (Vermox) or pyrantel pamoate (Pin-X) will be given in two oral doses spaced two weeks apart. These medica- tions eradicate the infection in approximately 90% of cases. Re-infection is common and several treatments may be required. Because the infection is easily spread through contact with contaminated clothing or surfaces, it is recommended that all family members receive the therapeutic dose. Sometimes a series of six treatments are given, each spaced two weeks apart. If family mem- bers continue to be infected, a source outside the house may be responsible. To relieve the rectal itching, a shallow warm bath with either half a cup of table salt, or Epsom salts is rec- ommended. Also, application of an ointment containing zinc oxide or regular petroleum jelly can be used to relieve rectal itching. Prognosis Pinworms cause little damage and can be easily erad- icated with proper treatment. Full recovery is expected. Prevention The disease can be prevented by treating all the infected cases and thus eliminating the source of infec- tion. Some ways to keep from catching or spreading the disease include the following recommendations: \u2022 wash hands thoroughly before handling food and eating \u2022 keep finger nails short and clean \u2022 avoiding scratching the anal area \u2022 take early morning showers to wash away eggs deposit- ed overnight \u2022 once the infection has been identified, and treatment is started, change the bed linen, night clothes, and under- wear daily \u2022 machine wash linens in hot water and dry with heat to kill any eggs \u2022 open the blinds or curtains since eggs are sensitive to sunlight Resources BOOKS Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine.

Rebecca J. Frey Enterobiasis Definition Enterobiasis, or pinworm infection as it is common- ly called, is an intestinal infection caused by the parasitic roundworm called Enterobius vermicularis . The most common symptom of this irritating, but not particularly dangerous, disease is itching around the anal area. Description Enterobiasis is also called seatworm infection or oxyuriasis. In the United States, enterobiasis is the most common worm infection, and some estimate that approx- imately 10% of the United States population is infected. Worldwide, approximately 200 million people are infect- ed. Enterobiasis can affect people of any age, but is most common among children ages 5\u201314 and particularly affects those in the daycare setting. Causes and symptoms The disease is highly contagious and is caused by a parasitic worm called Enterobius vermicularis. The adult female worm is about the size of a staple (approximately 0.4 in [1 cm] long and 0.02 in [0.5 mm] wide) and has a pointed tip. The disease is transmitted by ingesting the eggs of the pinworm. These eggs travel to the small intes- tine where, after approximately one month, they hatch and mature into adult worms. During the night, the female adult worms travel to the area around the anus and deposit eggs in the folds of the anal area. A single female pinworm can lay 10,000 eggs and, after laying eggs, dies. The eggs are capable of causing infection after six hours at body temperature. Significant itching in the anal region is caused by the movement of the adult worm as the eggs are deposited. When an individual scratches the anal region, the tiny eggs get under the finger nails and in the underwear and night clothes. Anything the individual touches with the contami- nated fingers, for example, toys, bedding, blankets, bath- room door knobs, or sinks, becomes contaminated. The eggs are very hardy and can live on surfaces for two to three weeks. Anyone touching these contaminated sur- faces can ingest the eggs and become infected.

          "content": "Description Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a disorder that occurs most frequently in women at the beginning and end of their reproductive lives. About half the cases occur in women over 45 years of age, and about one fifth occur in women under age 20. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed when other causes of uterine bleeding have been eliminated. Failure of the ovary to release an egg during the menstru- al cycle occurs in about 70% of women with DUB. This is probably related to a hormonal imbalance. DUB is common in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (cysts on the ovaries). Women who are on dialysis may also have heavy or prolonged periods. So do some women who use an intrauterine device ( IUD) for birth control. DUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed- ing disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions. Menorrhagia Menorrhagia, sometimes called hypermenorrhea, is another term for abnormally long, heavy periods. This type of period can be a symptom of DUB, or many other diseases or disorders. In menorrhagia, menstrual periods occur regularly, but last more than seven days, and blood loss exceeds 3 oz (88.7 ml). Passing blood clots is com- mon. Between 15\u201320% of healthy women experience debilitating menorrhagia that interferes with their normal activities. Menorrhagia may or may not signify a serious underlying problem. Metrorrhagia Metrorrhagia is bleeding between menstrual periods. Bleeding is heavy and irregular as opposed to ovulatory spotting which is light bleeding, in mid-cycle, at the time of ovulation. Polymenorrhea Polymenorrhea describes the condition of having too frequent periods. Periods occur more often than every 21 days, and ovulation usually does not occur dur- ing the cycle. Causes and symptoms Dysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, is stimulated to grow by the hormone estrogen. When exposure to estro- gen is extended, or not balanced by the presence of prog- esterone, the endometrium continues to grow until it out- grows its blood supply. Then it sloughs off, causing irregular bleeding. If the bleeding is heavy enough and frequent enough, anemia can result. Menorrhagia is representative of DUB. It is caused by many conditions including some outside the repro- ductive system. Causes of menorrhagia include: \u2022 adenomyosis (a benign condition characterized by growths in the area of the uterus) \u2022 imbalance between the hormones estrogen and proges- terone \u2022 fibroid tumors \u2022 pelvic infection \u2022 endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner mucous membrane of the uterus) \u2022 endometrial polyps \u2022 endometriosis (a condition in which endometrial or endrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normal place in the uterus) \u2022 use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception \u2022 hypothyroidism \u2022 blood clotting problems (rare) \u2022 lupus erythematosus \u2022 pelvic inflammatory disease \u2022 steroid therapy \u2022 advanced liver disease \u2022 renal (kidney) disease \u2022 chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemicals) To diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of the potential causes mentioned above must be eliminat- ed. When all potential causes connected with pregnancy, infection, and tumors (benign or malignant) are eliminat- ed, then menorrhagia is presumed to be caused by dys- functional uterine bleeding. Diagnosis Diagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with the patient herself. The doctor will ask for a detailed description of the problem, and take a history of how long it has existed, and any patterns the patient has observed. A woman can assist the doctor in diagnosing the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding by keeping a record of the time, frequency, length, and quantity of bleeding. She should also tell the doctor about any ill- nesses, including long-standing conditions, like diabetes mellitus. The doctor will also inquire about sexual activ- ity, use of contraceptives, current medications, and past surgical procedures. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1112 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding",

          "content": "are evaluated, in addition to measuring pressures of and collecting blood samples from the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery. Left-sided heart catheterization is performed by way of a catheter through an artery which tests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function of the mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle. Purpose The primary reason for conducting a cardiac catheterization is to diagnose and manage persons known or suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con- dition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually in the United States. Symptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform- ing this procedure include: \u2022 chest pain, characterized by prolonged heavy pressure or a squeezing pain \u2022 abnormal treadmill stress test \u2022 myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack \u2022 congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi- nated from birth \u2022 a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease \u2022 a need to measure the heart muscle\u2019s ability to pump blood Typically performed along with angiography, a tech- nique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outline the heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the visualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalities in the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi- ologist may assess the patient\u2019s need and readiness for coronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasive approach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either surgically or with the use of a balloon (angioplasty). When looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro- scopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to be assessed: \u2022 enlargement of the left ventricle \u2022 ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood vessel) \u2022 narrowing of the aortic valve \u2022 insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve \u2022 the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the other due to septal defects (also known as shunting) Precautions Cardiac catheterization is categorized as an \u201cinva- sive\u201d procedure which involves the heart, its valves, and coronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm or leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important to evaluate for the following conditions before considering this procedure: \u2022 A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func- tion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi- tions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro- cedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure. \u2022 A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected, antibiotics may be given before the test to prevent inflammation of the membrane which lines the heart (endocarditis). Description To understand how a cardiac catheterization is able to diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work- ings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just as the body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in its everyday functions, so does the heart. The heart is made up of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter- ies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy- gen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality in any of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart\u2019s function. These abnormalities cause the heart\u2019s blood flow to decrease and result in the condition known as coronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency. Catheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and treating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of fluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may resemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the veins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can monitor a body\u2019s various functions at each moment. Generally a test that lasts two to three hours, a patient should expect the following prior to and during the catheterization procedure: \u2022 A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient to relax but remain conscious during the test. \u2022 An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to administer medication. Electrodes will be attached to the chest to enable the painless procedure known as an electrocardiograph. \u2022 Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by injecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is injected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quick stinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced as the catheter travels through the blood vessel. \u2022 After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery system, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is injected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 656 Cardiac catheterization",

Richard Robinson Electronic fetal monitoring Definition Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for examining the condition of a baby in the uterus by noting any unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni- toring is performed late in pregnancyor continuously dur- ing labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFM can be utilized either externally or internally in the womb. Purpose The heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust- ment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli. The fetal monitor records an unborn baby\u2019s heart rate and graphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoring is usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when the baby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFM include: babies in a breech position, premature labor , and induced labor, among others. When electronic fetal monitoring was originally introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that it would help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lack of oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birth asphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn deaths. It occurs when there are less than normal amounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ and there is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue. A lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia. Perinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth, shortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If the interruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the baby may recover without any damage. If the time is longer, there may be some injury that is reversible. If the time period without oxygen is very long, there may be perma- nent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor- tant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible. One of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm in the unborn baby, which can be detected by electronic fetal monitoring. The fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the machine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby\u2019s heartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits just picks up the sound of the baby\u2019s heart beating. The fetal monitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heart rate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con- tractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps the doctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling the stress of contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby\u2019s heartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then go back to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks for any changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there is a drastic drop in the baby\u2019s heart beat or if the heart rate does not recover immediately after a contraction. Because it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When an adult complains to a provider about not feeling well, checking the heart rate is only one of many things that the doctor will do. With an unborn baby, however, check- ing the heart rate is basically the only thing that a doctor or midwife can do. Fetal monitoring can be helpful in a variety of differ- ent situations. During pregnancy, fetal monitoring can be used as a part of antepartum testing .

          "content": "Its healing effects have been well documented since as early as 1550 B.C. by the Egyptians. However, charcoal was almost forgotten until 15 years ago when it was rediscovered as a wonderful oral agent to treat most over- doses and toxins. Description Activated charcoal\u2019s most important use is for treat- ment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption of most poisons or drugs by the stomach and intestines. In addition to being used for most swallowed poisons in humans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rab- bits, rats, and other animals, as well. It can also adsorb gas in the bowels and has been used for the treatment of gas or diarrhea. Charcoal\u2019s other uses such as treatment of viruses, bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snake venoms and other substances by adsorption have not been supported by clinical studies. By adding water to the powder to make a paste, activated charcoal can be used as an external application to alleviate pain and itch- ing from bites and stings. Poisons and drug overdoses It is estimated that one million children accidentally overdose on drugs mistaken as candies or eat, drink, or inhale poisonous household products each year. Infants and toddlers are at the greatest risk for accidental poison- ing. Activated charcoal is one of the agents most com- monly used for these cases. It can absorb large amounts of poisons quickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be stored for a long time, and can be conveniently administered at home. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxic substances in the stomach and intestines. This prevents the toxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout the body. The activated charcoal with the toxic substance bound to it is then excreted in the stool without harm to the body. When poisoning is suspected the local poison control center should be contacted for instructions. They may recommend using activated charcoal, which should be available at home so that it can be given to the poi- soned child or pet immediately. For severe poisoning, several doses of activated charcoal may be needed. Intestinal disorders In the past, activated charcoal was a popular remedy for gas. Even before the discovery of America by Euro- peans, Native Americans used powdered charcoal mixed with water to treat an upset stomach. Now charcoal is being rediscovered as an alternative treatment for this con- dition. Activated charcoal works like a sponge. Its huge surface area is ideal for soaking up different substances, including gas. In one study, people taking activated char- KEY TERMS Antidote \u2014A remedy to counteract a poison or injury. Adsorption\u2014The binding of a chemical (e.g., drug or poison) to a solid material such as activated charcoal or clay. coal after eating a meal with high gas-producing foods did not produce more gas than those who did not have these foods. Charcoal has also been used to treat other intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, constipation, and cramps. There are few studies to support these uses and there are also concerns that frequent use of charcoal may decrease absorption of essential nutrients, especially in children. Other uses Besides being a general antidote for poisons or reme- dy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to treat other conditions as well. Based on its ability to adsorb or bind to other substances, charcoal has been effectively used to clean skin wounds and to adsorb waste materials from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been used to adsorb snake venoms, viruses, bacteria, and harmful materials excreted by bacteria or fungi. However, because of lack of scientific studies, these uses are not recom- mended. Activated charcoal, when used together with other remedies such as aloe vera, acidophilus, and psylli- um, helps to keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under control. While charcoal shows some anti-aging activity in rats, it is doubtful if it can do the same for humans. Recommended dosage For poisoning Activated charcoal is available without prescription. However, in case of accidental poisoning or drug overdose an emergency poison control center, hospital emergency room, or doctor\u2019s office should be called for advice. In case that both syrup of ipecac and charcoal are recommended for treatment of the poison, ipecac should be given first. Charcoal should not be given for at least 30 minutes after ipecac or until vomiting from ipecac stops. Activated char- coal is often mixed with a liquid before being swallowed or put into the tube leading to the stomach. Activated charcoal is available as 1.1 oz (33 ml) liquid bottles. It is also avail- able in 0.5 oz (15 ml) container sizes and as slurry of char- coal pre-mixed in water or as a container in which water or soda pop is added.

For acute poisoning, the dosage is as follows: \u2022 Infants (under 1 year of age): 1 g/kg. \u2022 Children (1\u201312 years of age): 15\u201330 g or 1\u20132 g/kg with at least 8 oz of water. \u2022 Adults: 30\u2013100 g or 1\u20132 g/kg with at least 8 oz of water. For diarrhea or gas A person can take charcoal tablets or capsules with water or sprinkle the content onto foods. The dosage for treatment of gas or diarrhea in adults is 520\u2013975 mg after each meal and up to 5 g per day. Precautions Parents should keep activated charcoal on hand in case of emergencies. Do not give charcoal together with syrup of ipecac. The charcoal will adsorb the ipecac. Charcoal should be taken 30 minutes after ipecac or after the vomiting from ipecac stops. Some activated charcoal products contain sorbitol. Sorbitol is a sweetener as well as a laxative, therefore, it may cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. These products should not be used in infants. Charcoal may interfere with the absorption of med- ications and nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. For uses other than for treatment of poisoning, charcoal should be taken two hours after other medications. Charcoal should not be used to treat poisoning caused by corrosive products such as lye or other strong acids or petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene, or cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the condition worse and delay diagnosis and treatment. In addition, charcoal is also not effective if the poison is lithium, cyanide, iron, ethanol, or methanol. Parents should not mix charcoal with chocolate syrup, sherbet, or ice cream, even though it may make charcoal taste better. These foods may prevent charcoal from working properly. Activated charcoal may cause swelling or pain in the stomach. A doctor should be notified immediately. It has been known to cause problems in people with intestinal bleeding, blockage or those people who have had recent surgery. These patients should talk to their doctor before using this product. Charcoal may be less effective in people with slow digestion. Charcoal should not be given for more than three or four days for treatment of diarrhea. Continuing for longer periods may interfere with normal nutrition. Charcoal should not be used in children under three years of age to treat diarrhea or gas. Activated charcoal should be kept out of reach of children. Side effects Charcoal may cause constipation when taken for overdose or accidental poisoning. A laxative should be taken after the crisis is over. Activated charcoal may cause the stool to turn black. This is to be expected. Pain or swelling of the stomach may occur. A doctor should be consulted. Interactions Activated charcoal should not be mixed together with chocolate syrup, ice cream or sherbet. These foods prevent charcoal from working properly.

          "content": "can be close enough to be confusing. However, the pres- ence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with a genital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid. For a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus ducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster- ile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus sample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special media and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi takes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In addition, the pus may be examined under the microscope to see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pus may also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. A blood sample will probably be taken from the patient\u2019s arm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria that causes syphilis. Treatment The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given either once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouth for one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin), co-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin (Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone (Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or ofloxacin (Floxin). The ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce the swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to the ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre- vent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskin may require circumcision . Pus would be removed from infected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe. Very large buboes may require surgical drainage. Prognosis Without treatment, chancroid may either go away quickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers for many months. A complete cure is obtained with antibiotic treatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars. Severe scarring of the foreskin may require circumcision. Urethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urine tube to the skin) may occur and requires corrective surgery. KEY TERMS Bubo\u2014A tender, swollen lymph node in the groin that may follow a chancroid ulcer. Groin\u2014The region of the body that lies between the abdomen and the thighs. Prevention The best prevention for chancroid is to use a con- dom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be prevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con- tact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with a disease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid, it is important that all sexual contacts of the patient are identified and treated.

It is made from wood or other materials that have been exposed to very high temperatures in an airless environment. It is then treated, or activated, to increase its ability to adsorb by reheating with oxidizing gas or other chemicals to break it into a very fine powder. Activated charcoal is pure carbon specially processed to make it highly adsorbent of particles and gases in the body\u2019s digestive system.

A physician should be notified if the patient is dehy- drated, and if oral replacement is suggested then com- mercial (Pedialyte and others) or homemade preparations can be used. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided this easy recipe for home preparation, which can be taken in small frequent sips: \u2022 Table salt\u20143/4 tsp \u2022 Baking powder\u20141 tsp \u2022 Orange juice\u20141 c \u2022 Water\u20141 qt (1 L) When feasible, food intake should be continued even in those with acute diarrhea. A physician should be con- sulted as to what type and how much food is permitted. Anti-motility agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate) are useful for those with chronic symptoms; their use is limited or even contraindicated in most individuals with acute diarrhea, especially in those with high fever or bloody bowel movements. They should not be taken without the advice of a physician. Other treatments are available, depending on the cause of symptoms. For example, the bulk agent psylli- um helps some patients by absorbing excess fluid and solidifying stools; cholestyramine, which binds bile acids, is effective in treating bile salt induced diarrhea. Low fat diets or more easily digestible fat is useful in some patients. New antidiarrheal drugs that decrease excessive secretion of fluid by the intestinal tract is another approach for some diseases. Avoidance of med- ications or other products that are known to cause diar- rhea (such as lactose) is curative in some, but should be discussed with a physician. Alternative treatment It is especially important to find the cause of diar- rhea, since stopping diarrhea when it is the body\u2019s way of eliminating something foreign is not helpful and can be harmful in the long run. One effective alternative approach to preventing and treating diarrhea involves oral supplementation of aspects of the normal flora in the colon with the yeasts Lactobacillus acidophilus , L. bifidus, or Saccharomyces boulardii . In clinical settings, these \u201cbiotherapeutic\u201d agents have repeatedly been helpful in the resolution of diarrhea, especially antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Their effectiveness is also supported by the results of a research study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1996. KEY TERMS Anti-motiltiy medications \u2014Medications such as loperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil), or medications containing codeine or narcotics that decrease the ability of the intestine to con- tract. These can worsen the condition of a patient with dysentery or colitis. Colitis\u2014Inflammation of the colon. Endoscope\u2014An endoscope, as used in the field of gastroenterology, is a thin flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Both diagnosis, through biopsies or other means, and therapeutic proce- dures can be done with this instrument. Endoscopy \u2014The performance of an exam using an endoscope is known generally as endoscopy. Lactose intolerance \u2014An inability to properly digest milk and dairy products. Oral rehydration solution (ORS)\u2014A liquid prepa- ration developed by the World Health Organiza- tion that can decrease fluid loss in persons with diarrhea. Originally developed to be prepared with materials available in the home, commercial preparations have recently come into use. Steatorrhea\u2014Excessive amounts of fat in the feces. Nutrient replacement also plays a role in preventing and treating episodes of diarrhea. Zinc especially appears to have an effect on the immune system, and deficiency of this mineral can lead to chronic diarrhea. Also, zinc replacement improves growth in young patients. Plenty of fluids, especially water, should be taken by individuals suffering from diarrhea to prevent dehydration. The BRAT diet also can be useful in helping to resolve diar- rhea. This diet limits food intake to bananas, rice, apple- sauce, and toast. These foods provide soluble and insolu- ble fiber without irritation. If the toast is slightly burnt, the charcoal can help sequester toxins and pull them from the body. Acute homeopathic remedies can be very effective for treating diarrhea especially in infants and young children.

Botulism is treated in a different way from other bacterial food poisonings. Botulism antitoxin is given to adults, but not infants, if it can be administered within 72 hours after symptoms are first observed. If given later, it provides no benefit. Both infants and adults require hospitalization, often in the intensive care unit. If the ability to breathe is impaired, patients are put on a mechanical ventilator to assist their breathing and are fed intravenously until the paralysis passes. Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners offer the same advice as tradi- tional practitioners concerning diet modification. In addi- tion they recommend taking charcoal tablets,Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus , and citrus seed extract. An electrolyte replacement fluid can be made at home by adding one teaspoon of salt and four teaspoons of sugar to one quart of water. For food poisoning other than botulism, two homeopathic remedies, either Arsenicum album or Nux vomica, are strongly recommended. Prognosis Most cases of food poisoning (except botulism) clear up on their own within one week without medical assistance.

Adults usually recover without medical interven- tion, but many children need to be hospitalized as the result of E. coli food poisoning. E. coli toxins may be absorbed into the blood stream where they destroy red blood cells and platelets. Platelets are important in blood clotting. About 5% of victims develop hemolytic-uremic syndrome which results in sudden kidney failure and makes dialysis necessary. (Dialysis is a medical proce- dure used to filter the body\u2019s waste product when the kidneys have failed). Botulism is the deadliest of the bacterial food-borne illnesses. With prompt medical care, the death rate is less than 10%. Prevention Food poisoning is almost entirely preventable by practicing good sanitation and good food handling tech- niques.

          "content": "However, if the aneurysm is small or in a place that would be difficult to reach, or if the person who has the aneurysm is in poor health, the surgical treatment may be a greater risk than the aneurysm. Risk of rupture is high- er for people who have more than one aneurysm. Unrup- tured aneurysm would probably be treated with a surgi- cal procedure called the clip ligation, as described below. Ruptured aneurysm The primary treatment for a ruptured aneurysm involves stabilizing the victim\u2019s condition, treating the immediate symptoms, and promptly assessing further treatment options, especially surgical procedures. The patient may require mechanical ventilation, oxygen, and fluids. Medications may be given to prevent major sec- ondary complications such as seizures, rebleeding, and vasospasm (narrowing of the affected blood vessel). Vasospasm decreases blood flow to the brain and causes the death of nerve cells. A drug such as nimodipine (Nimotop) may help prevent vasospasm by relaxing the smooth muscle tissue of the arteries. Even with treat- ment, however, vasospasm may cause stroke or death. To prevent further hemorrhage from the aneurysm, it must be removed from circulation. In general, surgical procedures should be performed as soon as possible to prevent rebleeding. The chances that aneurysm will rebleed are greatest in the first 24 hours, and vasospasm usually does not occur until 72 hours or more after rup- ture. If the patient is in poor condition or if there is vasospasm or other complication, surgical procedures may be delayed. The preferred surgical method is a clip ligation in which a clip is placed around the base of the aneurysm to block it off from circulation. Surgical coat- ing, wrapping, or trapping of the aneurysm may also be performed. These procedures do not completely remove the aneurysm from circulation, however, and there is some risk that it may rebleed in the future. Newer tech- niques that look promising include balloon embolization, a procedure that blocks the aneurysm with an inflatable membrane introduced by means of a catheter inserted through the artery. Prognosis An unruptured aneurysm may not cause any symp- toms over an entire lifetime. Surgical clip ligation will ensure that it won\u2019t rupture, but it may be better to leave the aneurysm alone in some cases. Familial cerebral aneurysms may rupture earlier than those without a genetic link. The outlook is not as good for a person who suffers a ruptured aneurysm. Fifteen to twenty-five percent of people who experience a ruptured aneurysm do not sur- vive. An additional 25\u201350% die as a result of complica- tions associated with the hemorrhage. Of the survivors, 15\u201350% suffer permanent brain damage and disability. These conditions are caused by the death of nerve cells. Nerve cells can be destroyed by the hemorrhage itself or by complications from the hemorrhage, such as vasospasm or hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus, a dilata- tion (expansion) of the fluid-filled cavity surrounding the brain, occurs in about 15% of cases. Immediate medical treatment is vital to prevent further complications and brain damage in those who survive the initial rupture. Patients who survive SAH and aneurysm clipping are unlikely to die from events related to SAH. Prevention There are no known methods to prevent an aneurysm from forming. If an aneurysm is discovered before it rup- tures, it may be surgically removed. CT or MRI angiogra- phy may be recommended for relatives of patients with familial cerebral aneurysms.

This rapid rewarming halts ice crystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels. Aloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) is applied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele- vated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on the extent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned by removing foreign material) or simply covered with aloe vera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to prevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen to combat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in most cases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen- sation returns during rewarming. Except when injury is minimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay of several days, during which hydrotherapy and physical therapy are used to restore the affected part to health. Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissue removal, and advise that 22\u201345 days must pass before a decision on amputation can safely be made. Frostnip Frostnipped fingers are helped by blowing warm air on them or holding them under one\u2019s armpits. Other frostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. The injured areas should never be rubbed. Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners suggest several kinds of treatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving the hospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or using contrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con- trast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold water applications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient can stand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol- lowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. These applications are repeated three times each, ending with the cold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissue growth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo- pathic and botanical therapies may also assist recovery from frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per- foratum) is recommended when nerve ending are affected (especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica montana) is prescribed for shock. Cayenne pepper (Cap- sicum frutescens) can enhance circulation and relieve pain. Drinking hot ginger (Zingiber officinale) tea also aids cir- culation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture to avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy. Prognosis The rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment, pioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much more effective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and amputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degree frostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in 1982\u201385 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss, 25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu- tation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatment using older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly 35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although the comparison group included a higher proportion of sec- ond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatment results was determined to be statistically significant. The extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf- ferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is not the only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the first weeks or months, people often experience tingling, a burning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks from an electric current. Other possible consequences of frost- bite include skin\u2014color changes, nail deformation or loss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every- one, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years\u2014 and sometimes a lifetime\u2014is inevitable. Prevention With the appropriate knowledge and precautions, frostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and most challenging environments. Appropriate clothing and footwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep the blood circulating properly, clothing should be worn loosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and head is also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garments need to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing and footwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco- hol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmful effects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warn against alcohol use and smoking in the cold because of the circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten- tion to the weather report before venturing outdoors and avoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolated areas during a blizzard are also important.

Without tissue examination, vasculitis can- not be diagnosed reliably, and probably coexists with CAA too rarely to justify steroid treatment in most cases.

Many survivors have persistent neurologic deficits related to the brain lobe affected by hemorrhage, and are at risk for additional hemorrhages, seizures, and dementia.

Laurie Barclay, MD Cerebral aneurysm Definition A cerebral aneurysm occurs at a weak point in the wall of a blood vessel (artery) that supplies blood to the brain. Because of the flaw, the artery wall bulges outward and fills with blood. This bulge is called an aneurysm. An aneurysm can rupture, spilling blood into the surround- ing body tissue. A ruptured cerebral aneurysm can cause permanent brain damage, disability, or death. Description A cerebral aneurysm can occur anywhere in the brain. Aneurysms can have several shapes. The saccular aneurysm, once called a berry aneurysm, resembles a piece of fruit dangling from a branch. Saccular aneurysms are usually found at a branch in the blood vessel where they balloon out by a thin neck. Saccular cerebral aneurysms most often occur at the branch points of large arteries at the base of the brain. Aneurysms may also take the form of a bulge in one wall of the artery\u2014a lateral aneurysm\u2014or a widening of the entire artery\u2014a fusiform aneurysm. The greatest danger of aneurysms is rupture. Approximately 50\u201375% of stricken people survive an aneurysmal rupture. A ruptured aneurysm spills blood into the brain or into the fluid-filled area that surrounds the brain tissue. Bleeding into this area, called the sub- arachnoid space, is referred to as subarachnoid hemor- rhage (SAH). About 25,000 people suffer a SAH each year. It is estimated that people with unruptured aneurysm have an annual 1\u20132% risk of hemorrhage. Under age 40, more men experience SAH. After age 40, more women than men are affected. Most people who have suffered a SAH from a rup- tured aneurysm did not know that the aneurysm even existed. Based on autopsy studies, medical researchers estimate that 1\u20135% of the population has some type of cerebral aneurysm. Aneurysms rarely occur in the very young or the very old; about 60% of aneurysms are diag- nosed in people between ages 40 and 65. Some aneurysms may have a genetic link and run in families. The genetic link has not been completely proven and a pattern of inheritance has not been deter- mined. Some studies seem to show that first-degree rela- tives of people who suffered aneurysmal SAH are more likely to have aneurysms themselves. These studies reported that such immediate family members were four times more likely to have aneurysms than the general population. Other studies do not confirm these findings. Better evidence links aneurysms to certain rare diseases of the connective tissue. These diseases include Marfan syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Polycystic kid- ney disease is also associated with cerebral aneurysms. These diseases are also associated with an increased risk of aneurysmal rupture. Certain other conditions raise GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 697 Cerebral aneurysm",

Unfortu- nately, these symptoms can be confused with tension headaches or migraines, and treatment can be delayed until rupture occurs. When an aneurysm ruptures, most victims experi- ence a sudden, extremely severe headache. This headache is typically described as the worst headache of the victim\u2019s life. Nausea and vomiting commonly accompany the headache. The person may experience a short loss of consciousness or prolonged coma. Other common signs of a SAH include a stiff neck,fever, and a sensitivity to light. About 25% of victims experience neurological problems linked to specific areas of the brain, swelling of the brain due to fluid accumulation (hydrocephalus), or seizure. Diagnosis Based on the clinical symptoms, a doctor will run several tests to confirm an aneurysm or an SAH. A com- puted tomography (CT) scan of the head is the initial procedure. A magnetic resonance imaging test (MRI) may be done instead of a CT scan. MRI, however, is not as sensitive as CT for detecting subarachnoid blood. A CT scan can determine whether there has been a hemor- rhage and can assist in pinpointing the location of the aneurysm.

If the CT scan is negative for a hemorrhage or pro- vides an unclear diagnosis, the doctor will order a cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) analysis , also called a lumbar puncture. In this procedure, a small amount of cere- brospinal fluid is removed from the lower back and examined for traces of blood and blood-breakdown prod- ucts. If this test is positive, cerebral angiography is used to map the brain\u2019s blood vessels and the damaged area. The angiography is done to pinpoint the aneurysm\u2019s location. About 15% of people who experience SAH have more than one aneurysm. For this reason, angiogra- phy should include both the common carotid artery that feeds the front of the brain and the vertebral artery that feeds the base of the brain. Occasionally, the angiogra- phy fails to find the aneurysm and must be repeated. If seizures occur, electroencephalography (EEG) may be used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. Treatment Unruptured aneurysm If an aneurysm has not ruptured and is not causing any symptoms, it may be left untreated.

Cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and recreational drug use (for example, use of cocaine) have been linked with an increased risk. The role, if any, of high blood pressure has not been determined. Some stud- ies have implicated high blood pressure in aneurysm for- mation and rupture, but people with normal blood pres- sure also experience aneurysms and SAHs. High blood pressure may be a risk factor but not the most important one. Pregnancy , labor, and delivery also seem to increase the possibility that an aneurysm might rupture, but not all doctors agree. Physical exertion and use of oral contraceptives are not suspected causes for aneurys- mal rupture. Causes and symptoms Cerebral aneurysms can be caused by brain trauma, infection, hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis), or abnormal rapid cell growth (neoplastic disease), but most seem to arise from a congenital, or developmental, defect. These congenital aneurysms occur more frequent- ly in women. Whatever the cause may be, the inner wall of the blood vessel is abnormally thin and the pressure of the blood flow causes an aneurysm to form. Most aneurysms go unnoticed until they rupture. However, 10\u201315% of unruptured cerebral aneurysms are found because of their size or their location. Common warning signs include symptoms that affect only one eye, such as an enlarged pupil, a drooping eyelid, or pain above or behind the eye. Other symptoms are a localized headache , unsteady gait, a temporary problem with sight, double vision, or numbness in the face. Some aneurysms bleed occasionally without rupturing. Symptoms of such an aneurysm develop gradually. The symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, neck pain, black-outs, ringing in the ears,dizziness, or seeing spots. Eighty to ninety percent of aneurysms are not diag- nosed until after they have ruptured. Rupture is not always a sudden event.

Several laboratory tests of the patient\u2019s blood pro- vide information for diagnosis. Measurement of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level in the patient\u2019s blood serum is the most useful laboratory test in the early stages. In a normal pregnancy, the level of this hormone doubles about every two days during the first 10 weeks. In an ectopic pregnancy, the rate of the increase is much slower and the low hCG for the stage of the pregnancy is a strong indication that the pregnancy is abnormal. (It could also represent a miscarriage in progress.) The level is usually tested several times over a period of days to determine whether or not it is increas- ing at a normal rate. Progesterone levels in the blood are also measured. Lower than expected levels can indicate that the pregnan- cy is not normal. An ultrasound examination may provide information about whether or not the pregnancy is ectopic.

The sound waves bounce off of the internal organs and create an image on a screen. The doctor should be able to see whether or not there is a fetus developing in the uterus after at least five weeks of gestation. Before that point, a normal pregnan- cy is too small to see. A culdocentesis may also help confirm a diagnosis. In this procedure a needle is inserted into the space at the top of the vagina, behind the uterus and in front of the rectum. Blood in this area may indicate bleeding from a ruptured fallopian tube. A laparoscopy will enable the doctor to see the patient\u2019s reproductive organs and examine an ectopic pregnancy. In this technique, a hollow tube with a light on one end is inserted through a small incision in the abdomen. Through this instrument the internal organs can be observed. Treatment Ectopic pregnancy requires immediate treatment. The earlier the condition is treated, the better the chance to preserve the fallopian tube intact for future normal pregnancies. Medical If the ectopic pregnancy is discovered in a very early stage of development, the drug methotrexate may be given. The best results are obtained when the pregnancy is less than six weeks old and the tubal mass is no more than 1.4 in (3.5 cm) in diameter. Methotrexate, which has been used successfully since 1987, works by inhibiting the growth of rapidly growing cells. (It is also used to treat some cancers.) Most side effects are mild and tem- porary, but the patient must be monitored after treatment. Usually the medication is injected into the muscle in a single dose, but may also be given intravenously or injected directly into the fallopian tube to dissolve the embryonic tissue. Methotrexate has also been used to treat ovarian, abdominal, and cervical pregnancies that are discovered in the early stages. Surgical When a laparoscopy is done to visualize the ectopic pregnancy, the scope can be fitted with surgical tools and used to remove the ectopic mass immediately after it is identified. The affected fallopian tube can be repaired or removed as necessary. This procedure can be done with- out requiring the patient to stay in the hospital overnight.

Description The fingertips are specialized areas of the hand with highly developed sensory and manipulative functions. Large sensory and motor areas located in the brain regu- late the precise and delicate functions of fingertips. The fingertip is the site where extensor and flexor tendons insert. Fingertip injuries are extremely common since the hands hold a wide array of objects. In 2001, the approxi- mately 10% of all accidents in the United States referred for Emergency Room consults involve the hand. Hand injuries are frequently the result of job injuries and account for 11\u201314% of on-the-job injuries and 6% of compensation paid injuries. Injury to the nail bed occurs in approximately 15\u201324% of fingertip injuries. Fingertip injuries can result in amputation or tissue loss. The injury is assessed whether the bone and underly- ing tissue are intact and the size of the wound area. The pulp is the area of skin opposite the fingernail and is usu- ally very vulnerable to injury. Pulp injuries commonly occur in persons who use or are in close contact with fast moving mechanical devices. These injuries can crush, cut, and puncture. The fingertips can also be injured by com- mon crushing accidents. This could cause the develop- ment of a subungal hematoma (an accumulation of blood under the nail). At the base of the distal phalanx (the first circular skin fold from the tip) injuries can occur that can fracture the underlying bone in the area.

The plural of embolism is emboli. Description Emboli have moved from the place where they were formed through the bloodstream to another part of the body, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow of blood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clots but are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis- sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or single and massive. They can be life-threatening and require immediate emergency medical care. There are three gen- eral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary. Pulmonary emboli are the most common. Arterial embolism In arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc- tion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, or thigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication of heart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere- bral embolism) causes stroke, which can be fatal. An estimated 5\u201314% of all strokes are caused by cerebral emboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis- sue death and amputation of the affected limb if not treated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneys can also suffer damage from emboli. Gas embolism Gas emboli result from the compression of respira- tory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapid changes in environmental pressure, for example, while flying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases, gases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood and other tissues become small bubbles that can block blood flow and cause organ damage. Pulmonary embolism In a pulmonary embolism, a common illness, blood flow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli block the main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there are no initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quickly become fatal. According to the American Heart Associa- tion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonary emboli annually and 60,000 die from it. A pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less than 10% of patients who die from a pulmonary embolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than 90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications of deep vein thrombosis , blood clots in the deep vein of the leg or pelvis. Causes and symptoms Arterial emboli are usually a complication of heart disease where blood clots form in the heart\u2019s chambers. Gas emboli are caused by rapid changes in environmen- tal pressure that could happen when flying or scuba div- ing. A pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel through the blood stream to the lungs and block a pulmonary artery. More than 90% of the cases of pul- monary embolism are a complication of deep vein thrombosis, which typically occurs in patients who have had orthopedic surgery and patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure. Risk factors for arterial and pulmonary emboli include: prolonged bed rest, surgery, childbirth , heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer,obesity,a broken hip or leg, oral contraceptives , sickle cell ane- mia, chest trauma, certain congenital heart defects, and old age. Risk factors for gas emboli include: scuba div- ing, amateur plane flight, exercise, injury, obesity, dehy- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1169 Embolism",

Areas of pus (abscesses) may appear as a result of dying worms or a secondary bacterial infection. Diagnosis The disease is diagnosed by taking a patient history, performing a physical examination , and by screening blood specimens for specific proteins produced by the immune system in response to this infection (antibodies). Early diagnosis may be difficult because, in the first stages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections. To make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for a pattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc- tion, together with the patient\u2019s possible exposure to filariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar- vae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, but because mosquitos, which spread the disease, are active at night, the larvae are usually only found in the blood between about 10 pm and 2 am. Treatment Either ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba- mazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat- ing the larvae, impairing the adult worms\u2019 ability to reproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu- nately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible. The medication is started at low doses to prevent reac- tions caused by large numbers of dying parasites. While effective, the medications can cause severe side effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either of the drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the blood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can cause severe allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filled sores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlled using antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs (cor- ticosteroids). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine in someone with very high levels of parasite infection may lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain (encephali- tis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and confusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive numbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drug reactions include dizziness, weakness, and nausea. Symptoms caused by the death of the parasites include fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and asthma. Reactions usually begin within two days of start- ing treatment and may last between two and four days. No treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may be used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drain the fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery may also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro- tum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat- ing the legs and providing support with elastic bandages. Prognosis The outlook is good in early or mild cases, especially if the patient can avoid being infected again. The disease is rarely fatal, and with continued WHO medical inter- vention, even gross elephantiasis is now becoming rare. Prevention The best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent being repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry the disease. Some methods of preventing insect bites include the following: \u2022 limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or jungle areas \u2022 wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored clothing that attracts mosquitoes \u2022 avoid perfumes and colognes \u2022 treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per- methrin (Duramon, Permanone) \u2022 wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children, try citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects \u2022 if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor screens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep \u2022 use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less active In addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest- ed areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before being bitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien- tists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time. Resources BOOKS Infectious Disease. Ed. Barbara A. Bannister, et al.

Enlarged lymph nodes, swelling of the affected area, skin ulcers, bone and joint pain, tired- ness, and red streaks along the arm or leg also may occur. Abscesses can form in lymph nodes or in the lymphatic vessels. They may appear at the surface of the skin as well. Long-term infection with lymphatic filariasis can lead to lymphedema, hydrocele (a buildup of fluid in any saclike cavity or duct) in the scrotum, and elephantiasis of the legs, scrotum, arms, penis, breasts, and vulvae. The most common site of elephantiasis is the leg. It typically begins in the ankle and progresses to the foot and leg. At first the swollen leg may feel soft to the touch but eventu- ally becomes hard and thick. The skin may appear dark- ened or warty and may even crack, allowing bacteria to infect the leg and complicate the disease. The microfilari- ae usually don\u2019t cause injury. In some instances, they cause \u201ceosinophilia,\u201d an increased number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cells) in the blood. This disease is more intense in people who never have been exposed to lymphatic filariasis than it is in the native people of tropical areas where the disease occurs. This is because many of the native people often are immunologically tolerant. Diagnosis The only sure way to diagnose lymphatic filariasis is by detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms or the microfilariae. Microscopic examination of the person\u2019s blood may reveal microfilariae. But many times, people who have been infected for a long time do not have microfilariae in their bloodstream. The absence of them, therefore, does not mean necessarily that the person is not infected. In these cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid or performing other clinical tests is necessary. Collecting blood from the individual for microscopic examination should be done during the night when the microfilariae are more numerous in the bloodstream. (Interestingly, this is when mosquitoes bite most frequent- ly.) During the day microfilariae migrate to deeper blood vessels in the body, especially in the lung. If it is decided to perform the blood test during the day, the infected indi- vidual may be given a \u201cprovocative\u201d dose of medication to provoke the microfilariae to enter the bloodstream. Blood then can be collected an hour later for examination. Detecting the adult worms can be difficult because they are deep within the lymphatic system and difficult to get to. Biopsies usually are not performed because they usually don\u2019t reveal much information. Treatment The drug of choice in treating lymphatic filariasis is diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The trade name in the United States is Hetrazan. The treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day, three times a day, for three weeks. The drug is taken in tablet form. DEC kills the microfilariae quickly and injures or kills the adult worms slowly, if at all. If all the adult worms are not killed, remaining paired males and females may continue to produce more larvae. There- fore, several courses of DEC treatment over a long time period may be necessary to rid the individual of the parasites. DEC has been shown to reduce the size of enlarged lymph nodes and, when taken long-term, to reduce ele- phantiasis. In India, DEC has been given in the form of a medicated salt, which helps prevent spread of the disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1167 Elephantiasis Man suffering from elephantiasis.

Lata Cherath, PhD Filariasis Definition Filiariasis is the name for a group of tropical dis- eases caused by various thread-like parasitic round worms (nematodes) and their larvae. The larvae transmit the disease to humans through a mosquito bite. Filariasis is characterized by fever, chills, headache , and skin lesions in the early stages and, if untreated, can progress to include gross enlargement of the limbs and genitalia in a condition called elephantiasis. Description Approximately 170 million people in the tropical and subtropical areas of southeast Asia, South America, Africa, and the islands of the Pacific are affected by this debilitat- ing parasitic disease. While filariasis is rarely fatal, it is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disabili- ty in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named filariasis one of only six \u201cpotentially eradica- ble\u201d infectious diseases and has embarked upon a 20-year campaign to eradicate the disease. In all cases, a mosquito first bites an infected indi- vidual then bites another uninfected individual, transfer- ring some of the worm larvae to the new host. Once with- in the body, the larvae migrate to a particular part of the body and mature to adult worms. Filariasis is classified into three distinct types according to the part of the body that becomes infected: lymphatic filariasis affects the cir- culatory system that moves tissue fluid and immune cells (lymphatic system); subcutaneous filariasis infects the areas beneath the skin and whites of the eye; and serous cavity filariasis infects body cavities but does not cause disease. Several different types of worms can be respon- sible for each type of filariasis, but the most common species include the following: Wucheria bancrofti, Bru- gia malayi (lymphatic filariasis), Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa, Mansonella streptocerca, Dracunculus medi- nensis (subcutaneous filariasis), Mansonella pustans , and Mansonella ozzardi (serous cavity filariasis). The two most common types of the disease are Ban- croftian and Malayan filariasis, both forms of lymphatic filariasis. The Bancroftian variety is found throughout Africa, southern and southeastern Asia, the Pacific islands, and the tropical and subtropical regions of South America and the Caribbean. Malayan filariasis occurs only in southern and southeastern Asia. Filariasis is occa- sionally found in the United States, especially among immigrants from the Caribbean and Pacific islands. A larvae matures into an adult worm within six months to one year and can live between four and six years. Each female worm can produce millions of larvae, and these larvae only appear in the bloodstream at night, when they may be transmitted, via an insect bite, to anoth- er host. A single bite is usually not enough to acquire an infection, therefore, short-term travelers are usually safe. A series of multiple bites over a period of time is required to establish an infection. As a result, those individuals who are regularly active outdoors at night and those who spend more time in remote jungle areas are at an increased risk of contracting the filariasis infection. Causes and symptoms In cases of lymphatic filariasis, the most common form of the disease, the disease is caused by the adult worms actually living in the lymphatic vessels near the lymph nodes where they distort the vessels and cause local inflammation. In advanced stages, the worms can actually obstruct the vessels, causing the surrounding tissue to become enlarged. In Bancroftian filariasis, the legs and genitals are most often involved, while the Malayan vari- ety affects the legs below the knees. Repeated episodes of inflammation lead to blockages of the lymphatic system, especially in the genitals and legs. This causes the affected area to become grossly enlarged, with thickened, coarse skin, leading to a condition called elephantiasis. In conjunctiva filariasis, the worms\u2019 larvae migrate to the eye and can sometimes be seen moving beneath the skin or beneath the white part of the eye (conjuncti- va). If untreated, this disease can cause a type of blind- ness known as onchocerciasis. Symptoms vary, depending on what type of parasitic worm has caused the infection, but all infections usually GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1330 Filariasis",

X rays can penetrate most structures. Precautions Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or second trimester, should not have chest x rays unless absolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women who are, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec- tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia- tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure, particularly for children. However, the amount of radia- tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal. Description Routine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal view (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat- eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand for this exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid in the lungs. During the actual time of exposure, the technologist will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is very important in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is no motion that could detract from the quality and sharpness of the film image. The procedure will only take a few minutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is a matter of a few seconds. The chest x ray may be performed in a physician\u2019s office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or hospital radiology department. In some cases, particular- ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may be taken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality than those taken with permanent equipment, but are the best choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden patients may be placed in as upright a position as possi- ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid. Preparation There is no advance preparation necessary for chest x rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam area, a hospi- tal gown will replace all clothing on the upper body and all jewelry must be removed. Aftercare No aftercare is required by patients who have chest x rays. Risks The only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal exposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant women and children. Those patients should use protective lead aprons during the procedure.

It is quite common for people to only have one bowel movement per day, and some as few as one or two per week. Alternative practitioners advise that we probably should have one bowel movement for every meal that we eat. If not, then we are not eliminating wastes complete- ly, and if input exceeds output, then we will surely suffer the consequences at some point. Incomplete elimination of body wastes may result in the following, depending on where the deposits end up: \u2022 sluggish system \u2022 joint pain and arthritis \u2022 irritable bowel syndrome \u2022 diverticulitis \u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease \u2022 leaky gut syndrome \u2022 heart problem \u2022 migraine \u2022 allergies \u2022 bad breath \u2022 acne and other skin problems such as psoriasis \u2022 asthma \u2022 early senility and Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2022 chronic fatigue syndrome \u2022 cancer, particularly of the bowel \u2022 multiple sclerosis During colonic irrigation, a small speculum is passed into the patient\u2019s bowel through the rectum. This is attached to a tube, which leads to a machine that pumps temperature-controlled water into the colon at a controlled rate (to be controlled by either the practitioner or the patient). The temperature of the water should ide- ally be kept as close to body temperature as possible. The patient will temporarily be filled with water up to the level of the entire colon. Patients say they can feel the water up under their ribs but that the process, although sometimes uncomfortable, is not painful. The amount of water will vary but will generally be in the region of between two and six liters (or quarts) at any one time. This triggers peristaltic action and the patient will begin to expel the water along with fecal matter back through the tube and into the machine. The fecal matter is flushed out through a viewing tube, so that what is eliminated may be monitored. Quite often, unsuspected parasites are expelled, along with very old fecal material, very dark in color, which may KEY TERMS Dysbiosis \u2014The condition that results when the natural flora of the gut are thrown out of balance, such as when antibiotics are taken.

Some therapists com- ment that it looks like aging rubber. During the treatment, the therapist will gently massage the patient\u2019s abdomen to help dislodge impacted fecal mat- ter. In addition to massage, sometimes acupressure, reflexology, or lymphatic drainage techniques may be used to loosen deposits and stimulate the bowel. It is important that the right amount of water is used, as too much will cause discomfort and too little will be ineffective. If cor- rectly done, colonic irrigation is not painful at all and some patients claim to sleep through their treatment. Sanitation is vital to this process. The tubes and speculums used are generally disposable, but other parts of the machine, such as the viewing tube, must be steril- ized after each patient. Normally, a series of treatments will be required to achieve desired results regarding the elimination of impacted, decaying matter, and restoration of bowel reg- ularity. Initially, only gas and recent fecal matter may be expelled. The residue attached to the colon wall is usual- ly the result of years of neglect, and therapists say that one cannot expect complete relief in only one session. Impacted fecal matter can cause an imbalance of the natural organisms that normally populate the bowel, caus- ing what is known as dysbiosis. Under ideal conditions, the bowel is populated by a variety of naturally occurring organisms. It seems that the enzymes occurring in fresh fruit and vegetables encourage these beneficial organ- isms. One of the results of eating processed denatured foods is that this natural balance is upset, and food may begin to rot in the bowel instead of being processed. Decomposing matter can cause a toxic condition and may lead to many health problems, as constipation caus- es backed up pollution of the body cells.

          "content": "pregnancy. Some drugs also increase the incidence of clefting, such as phenytoin, sodium valproate, and methotrexate. The pregnant mother\u2019s nutrition may affect the incidence of clefting as well. Babies born with a cleft lip will be seen to have an elongated opening in the upper lip. The size of this opening may range from a small notch in the upper lip to an open- ing that extends into the base of the nostril. The cleft lip may be below the right or left nostril or below both nostrils. Babies born with a cleft palate will be seen to have an opening into the roof of the mouth. The size and posi- tion of the cleft varies and it may involve only the hard palate, or only the soft palate and may occur on both sides of the center of the palate. In some cases the cleft palate will be covered with the normal lining of the mouth and can only be felt by the examiner. Babies with cleft lips and palates have feeding diffi- culties, which are more severe in babies with cleft palates. The difficulty in feeding is due to the baby being unable to achieve complete suction. In the case of clefts of the hard palate, liquids enter the nose from the mouth through the opening in the hard palate. A cleft palate also affects a child\u2019s speech, since the palate is necessary for speech formation. The child\u2019s speech pattern may still be affected despite surgical repair. Ear infections are more common in babies born with cleft palates. The infections occur because the muscles of the palate do not open the Eustachian tubes which drain the middle ear. This allows fluid to collect and increases the risk of infection and hearing loss. Teeth may also erupt misaligned. Diagnosis Cleft lip and palate can be diagnosed before birth by ultrasound. After birth, cleft lip and palate are diagnosed by physical exam. Treatment If cleft lip and/or palate are diagnosed by ultrasound before birth, further testing may be required to diagnose associated abnormalities if present. Referral to a cleft team is essential. A cleft team consists of specialists in the management of babies with clefts and includes sur- geons as well as nurses and speech therapists. Members of the team inform the parents of all aspects of manage- ment. Feeding methods are also discussed, since feeding is the first problem that must be dealt with. It may be possible to breastfeed a baby born with only a cleft lip, but babies born with cleft palates usually have more problems with feeding and frequently require special bottles and teats. A palatal obturator is a device that fits into the roof of the mouth, thus blocking the cleft open- ing and allowing easier suckling. Surgery to repair cleft lips is sometimes performed after orthodontic treatment to narrow the gap in the upper lip. The orthodontic treatment can involve acrylic splints with or without screws or may involve the use of adhesive tape placed across the gap in the lip. The orthodontic treat- ment for cleft lip should be started within the first three weeks of life and continue until the cleft lip is repaired. The timing of surgical cleft lip repair depends on the judgment of the surgeon who will perform the operation. The procedure is usually performed between one and three months of age. The goals of the operation are to close the gap in the upper lip, place scars in the natural skin curves and to repair muscle so that the lip appears normal during movement. The closure is done in the three layers (skin, muscle, and mucosa) that line the inside of the lip. At the time of the procedure, if the nose is shaped abnormally due to the cleft lip, it is also cor- rected. Sometimes further surgery may be needed on the lip and/or nose to refine the result. The goals of the surgeon repairing a cleft palate are normal speech, normal facial growth, and hearing for the affected infant. The repair of the cleft palate is usually per- formed between three and 18 months of age. The timing may extend beyond this and varies with the type of cleft palate and center where the procedure is being performed.

          "content": "Depending of the type of cleft palate, more than one oper- ation may be needed to close the cleft and improve speech. Nonsurgical treatment of a cleft palate is available for patients who are at high risk for surgery and consists of a prosthetic appliance worn to block the opening in the palate. Babies born with cleft palates are vulnerable to ear infections. Their Eustachian tubes do not effectively drain fluid from the middle ear so fluid accumulates and infection sets in. This may lead to hearing loss. These children require drainage tubes to be inserted to prevent fluid accumulation. Babies born with clefts usually require orthodontic treatment between 13 and 18 years of age. They also require speech therapy. Prognosis Babies born with cleft lip and palate have a good prognosis, and approximately 80% will develop normal speech. There is no known means of preventing clefting. Good prenatal care is essential and avoiding harmful substances appear to reduce the risk.

CFIs are sometimes referred to as closed fist injuries or fight bites. Description Clenched fist injuries are most common over the metacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is deceptive because they do not bleed heavily and the underlying injury is hidden by soft tissue when the patient opens his hand and straightens the injured finger. CFIs can, however, have seri- ous consequences, including infection, cellulitis, inflam- mation of the bone or bone marrow (osteomyelitis), septic arthritis, and inflammation of the sheaths covering the ten- dons of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to perma- nent loss of function or amputation. Most CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force of impact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting from contact with the teeth, and contamination of the wound by the bacteria in human saliva. As the patient opens his hand, the skin of the finger is pulled backward over the deeper part of the wound, thus sealing bacteria within the injured tissue. This sealing of the wound by normal motions of the finger is the reason why clenched fist injuries have the highest rate of infection of any human bite. The rate of infection of clenched-fist injuries varies from 15\u201350%. Causes and symptoms The causes of CFIs include fighting and other forms of aggressive behavior, often combined with drug or alcohol consumption. The symptoms of clenched fist injury include pain in the affected part of the hand and some stiffness of the injured finger with limitation of movement. If the patient has delayed getting medical treatment, there may be evi- dence of infection, including swelling, redness, and sup- puration (a discharge of pus). The skin around the wound will be warm to the touch and fever may be present. Diagnosis Diagnosis of clenched fist injuries is usually made on the basis of the location of the injury and x-ray find- ings. The most common finding in CFI x rays is soft tis- sue swelling, but the x rays may also reveal air pockets in deep tissues or the joint spaces, fragments of teeth, frac- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2820 Clenched fist injury",

Samuel Uretsky, PharmD Corticotropin test see Adrenocorticotropic hormone test Cortisol tests Definition This test is a measure of serum cortisol (also known as hydrocortisone), or urine cortisol (also known as uri- nary free cortisol), an important hormone produced by a pair of endocrine glands called the adrenal glands. Purpose This test is performed on patients who may have malfunctioning adrenal glands. Blood and urine cortisol, together with the determination of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), are the three most important tests in the investigation of Cushing\u2019s syndrome (caused by an overproduction of cortisol) and Addison\u2019s disease (caused by the underproduction of cortisol). Precautions Increased levels of cortisol are associated with preg- nancy. Physical and emotional stress can also elevate cortisol levels. Drugs that may cause increased levels of cortisol include estrogen, oral contraceptives, ampheta- mines, cortisone, and spironolactone (Aldactone). Drugs that may cause decreased levels include androgens, aminoglutethimide, betamethasone, and other steroid medications, danazol, lithium, levodopa, metyrapone and phenytoin (Dilantin). Description Cortisol is a potent hormone known as a glucocorti- coid that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, pro- teins, and fats, but especially glucose. Cortisol increases blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of glucose from glucose stores in cells. It also acts to inhibit insulin, thus affecting glucose transport into cells.

A cleft lip, sometimes referred to as a harelip, is an opening in the upper lip that can extend into the base of the nostril. A cleft palate is an opening in the roof of the mouth. Description Babies born with cleft lips will have an opening involv- ing the upper lip. The length of the opening ranges from a small notch, to a cleft that extends into the base of the nos- tril. Cleft lips may involve one or both sides of the lip. Babies born with cleft palates have openings in the palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and posi- tion of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in the hard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the mouth, opening into the floor of the nose. It may be only in the soft palate, the soft portion of the roof of the mouth. The cleft palate may involve both the hard and soft palate and may occur on both sides of the center of the palate. Babies may have cleft lips with or without cleft palates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips. The incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated with a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native Ameri- cans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns. The inci- dence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in 1,000. The inci- dence among whites is one in 1,000 newborns. African Americans have an incidence of 0.3 in 1,000 newborns. Causes and symptoms Cleft lips and palates not associated with a syn- drome are caused by a combination of genetic and envi- ronmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a combi- nation is called multifactorial. The embryo inherits genes that increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate. When an embryo with such genes is exposed to certain environ- mental factors the embryo develops a cleft. The risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or palate increases with the number of affected relatives and increases with relatives that have more severe clefts. Environmental factors that increase the risk of cleft lip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use during GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2818 Cleft lip and palate",

The condition is also known as talipes. Description True clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone for- mation in the foot. There are four variations of clubfoot, including talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes equines, and talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the most common form of clubfoot, the foot generally turns inward so that the leg and foot look somewhat like the letter J. In talipes valgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In tal- ipes equinus, the foot points downward, similar to that of a toe dancer. In talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward, with the heel pointing down. Clubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes an infant\u2019s feet appear abnormal at birth because of the intrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is no anatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true club- foot, and the problem can usually be corrected by apply- ing special braces or casts to straighten the foot. The ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5 to 1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In the United States, the incidence is approximately 1 in every 1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported an over- all incidence of 1.20 in every 1,000 children; by 1994, that number had doubled to 2.41 in every 1,000 live births. No reason was offered for the increase. Causes and symptoms Experts do not agree on the precise cause of club- foot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance has been extensively investigated using family studies and other epidemiological methods. As of 1999, no definitive conclusions had been reached, although a Mendelian pat- tern of inheritance is suspected. This may be due to the interaction of several different inheritance patterns, dif- ferent patterns of development appearing as the same condition, or a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associ- ated with clubfoot in animal studies. But, as of 2001, these findings have not been replicated in humans. A family history of clubfoot has been reported in 24.4% of families in a single study. These findings sug- gest the potential role of one or more genes being respon- sible for clubfoot. Several environmental causes have been proposed for clubfoot. Obstetricians feel that intrauterine crowd- ing causes clubfoot. This theory is supported by a sig- nificantly higher incidence of clubfoot among twins compared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure to the drug misoprostol has been linked with clubfoot. Misoprostol is commonly used when trying, usually unsuccessfully, to induce abortion in Brazil and in other countries in South and Central America. Researchers in Norway have reported that males who are in the printing trades have significantly more off- spring with clubfoot than men in other occupations. For unknown reasons, amniocentesis , a prenatal test, has also been associated with clubfoot. The infants of mothers who smoke during pregnancy have a greater chance of being born with clubfoot than are offspring of women who do not smoke. True clubfoot is usually obvious at birth. The four most common varieties have been described. A clubfoot has a typical appearance of pointing downward and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 822 Clubfoot",

Folic acid is a vitamin that has been shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects. Pregnant women should avoid exposure to infection, especially during the first trimester. Abstention from drugs and alcohol during pregnancy may reduce risk. Genetic counseling is advisable for parents who have had one child with anencephaly, since the likelihood of having another is increased. Resources BOOKS Bradley, W. G., et al.

This con- dition has been more recently termed developmental hip dysplasia, as it often develops over the first few weeks, months, or years of life. Description Congenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children that is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. During gestation, the infant\u2019s hip should be developing with the head of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centered in its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulum should cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit- ting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla- sia, the development of the acetabulum in an infant allows the femoral head to ride upward out of the joint socket, especially when weight bearing begins. Causes and symptoms Clinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip dysplasia, with more females affected than males. This disorder is found in many cultures around the world. However, statistics show that the Native American popu- lation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This has been documented to be due to the common practice of swaddling and using cradleboards for restraining the infants. This places the infant\u2019s hips into extreme adduc- tion (brought together). The incidence of congenital hip dysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian and breech position births. Evidence also shows a greater chance of this hip abnormality in the first born compared to the second or third child. Hormonal changes within the mother during pregnancy, resulting in increased ligament laxity, is thought to possibly cross over to the placenta and cause the baby to have lax ligaments while still in the womb. Other symptoms of complete dislocation include a shortening of the leg and limited ability to abduct the leg. Diagnosis Because the abnormalities of this hip problem often vary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for an accurate diagnosis of congenital hip dysplasia. The hip disorder can be diagnosed by moving the hip to determine if the head of the femur is moving in and out of the hip joint. One specific method, called the Ortolani test, begins with each of the examiners\u2019 hands around the infant\u2019s knees, with the second and third fingers pointing down the child\u2019s thigh. With the legs abducted (moved apart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinct clicking sound with motion. If symptoms are present with a noted increase in abduction, the test is considered positive for hip joint instability. It is important to note this test is only valid a few weeks after birth. The Barlow method is another test performed with the infant\u2019s hip brought together with knees in full bent posi- tion. The examiner\u2019s middle finger is placed over the out- side of the hipbone while the thumb is placed on the inner side of the knee. The hip is abducted to where it can be felt if the hip is sliding out and then back in the joint. In older babies, if there is a lack of range of motion in one hip or even both hips, it is possible that the movement is blocked because the hip has dislocated and the muscles have con- tracted in that position. Also in older infants, hip disloca- tion is evident if one leg looks shorter than the other. X-ray films can be helpful in detecting abnormal find- ings of the hip joint. X rays may also be helpful in finding the proper positioning of the hip joint for treatments of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 892 Congenital hip dysplasia",

          "content": "less by heat. Finally, botulism is much more likely to be fatal even in tiny quantities. Adult botulism outbreaks are usually associated with home canned food, although occasionally commer- cially canned or vacuum packed foods are responsible for the disease. C. botulinum grows well in non-acidic, oxygen-free environments. If food is canned at too low heat or for too brief a time, the bacteria is not killed. It reproduces inside the can or jar, releasing its deadly neu- rotoxin. The toxin can be made harmless by heating the contaminated food to boiling for ten minutes. However, even a very small amount of the C. botulinum toxin can cause serious illness or death. Symptoms of adult botulism appear about 18\u201336 hours after the contaminated food is eaten, although there are documented times of onset ranging from four hours to eight days. Initially a person suffering from bot- ulism feels weakness and dizziness followed by double vision. Symptoms progress to difficulty speaking and swallowing. Paralysis moves down the body, and when the respiratory muscles are paralyzed, death results from asphyxiation. People who show any signs of botulism poisoning must receive immediate emergency medical care to increase their chance of survival. Infant botulism is a form of botulism first recog- nized in 1976. It differs from food-borne botulism in its causes and symptoms. Infant botulism occurs when a child under the age of one year ingests the spores of C. botulinum . These spores are found in soil, but a more common source of spores is honey. The C. botulinum spores lodge in the baby\u2019s intesti- nal tract and begin to grow, producing their neurotoxin. Onset of symptoms is gradual. Initially the baby is consti- pated. This is followed by poor feeding, lethargy, weak- ness, drooling, and a distinctive wailing cry. Eventually, the baby loses the ability to control its head muscles. From there the paralysis progresses to the rest of the body. Diagnosis One important aspect of diagnosing food poisoning is for doctors to determine if a number of people have eaten the same food and show the same symptoms of ill- ness. When this happens, food poisoning is strongly sus- pected. The diagnosis is confirmed when the suspected bacteria is found in a stool culture or a fecal smear from the person. Other laboratory tests are used to isolate bac- teria from a sample of the contaminated food. Botulism is usually diagnosed from its distinctive neurological symptoms, since rapid treatment is essential. Many cases of food poisoning go undiagnosed, since a definite diag- nosis is not necessary to effectively treat the symptoms. Because it takes time for symptoms to develop, it is not necessarily the most recent food one has eaten that is the cause of the symptoms. Treatment Treatment of food poisoning, except that caused by C. botulinum, focuses on preventing dehydration by replacing fluids and electrolytes lost through vomiting and diarrhea. Electrolytes are salts and minerals that form electrically charges particles (ions) in body fluids. Electrolytes are important because they control body fluid balance and are important for all major body reac- tions. Pharmacists can recommend effective, pleasant- tasting, electrolytically balanced replacement fluids that are available without a prescription. When more fluids are being lost than can be consumed, dehydration may occur. Dehydration more likely to happen in the very young, the elderly, and people who are taking diuretics . To prevent dehydration, a doctor may give fluids intravenously. In very serious cases of food poisoning, medications may be given to stop abdominal cramping and vomiting. Anti-diarrheal medications are not usually given. Stop- ping the diarrhea keeps the toxins in the body longer and may prolong the infection. People with food poisoning should modify their diet. During period of active vomiting and diarrhea they should not try to eat and should drink only clear liquids frequently but in small quantities. Once active symptoms stop, they should eat bland, soft, easy to digest foods for two to three days. One example is the BRAT diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, all of which are easy to digest. Milk products, spicy food, alcohol and fresh fruit should be avoided for a few days, although babies should continue to breastfeed. These modifications are often all the treatment that is necessary. Severe bacterial food poisonings are sometimes treated with antibiotics.

Fibromyomas see Uterine fibroids Fibrous breast lumps see Fibroadenoma Fifth disease Definition Fifth disease is a mild childhood illness caused by the human parvovirus B19 that causes flu-like symptoms and a rash. It is called fifth disease because it was fifth on a list of common childhood illnesses that are accompa- nied by a rash, including measles , rubella or German measles, scarlet fever (or scarlatina), and scarlatinella, a variant of scarlet fever. Description The Latin name for the disease is erythema infectio- sum, meaning infectious redness. It is also called the \u201cslapped cheek disease\u201d because, when the bright red rash first appears on the cheeks, it looks as if the face has been slapped. Anyone can get the disease, but it occurs more frequently in school-aged children. The disease is usually mild, and both children and adults usually recov- er quickly without complications. In fact, some individu- als exhibit no symptoms and never even feel ill. Out- breaks most often occur in the winter and spring. Causes and symptoms Fifth disease is caused by the human parvovirus B19, a member of the Parvoviridae family of viruses, that lives in the nose and throat of the infected person. The virus is spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Because the virus needs a rapidly dividing cell in order to multiply, it attacks the red blood cells of the body. Once infected, a person is believed to be immune to reinfection. Symptoms may appear four to 21 days after being exposed to the virus. Initial symptoms are flu-like and include headache, body ache, sore throat, a mild fever of 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), and chills. It is at this time, prior to the development of the rash, that individuals are conta- gious. These symptoms last for two to three days. In chil- dren, a bright red rash that looks like a slap mark devel- ops suddenly on the cheeks. The rash may be flat or raised and may or may not be itchy. Sometimes, the rash spreads to the arms, legs, and trunk, where it has a lace- like or net-like appearance. The rash can also involve the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. By the time the rash appears, individuals are no longer infectious. On average, the rash lasts for 10\u201311 days, but may last for as long as five to six weeks. The rash may fade away and then reappear upon exposure to sunlight, hot baths, emo- tional distress, or vigorous exercise. Adults generally do not develop a rash, but instead may have swollen and painful joints, especially in the hands and feet. In adults, symptoms such as sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain,diarrhea, and vom- iting occur more frequently than in children and are usually more severe. The joint pain can be arthritis-like and last for several months, especially in women, but the disease does not appear to progress to rheumatoid arthritis. The virus causes the destruction of red blood cells and, therefore, a deficiency in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (anemia) can result. In healthy peo- ple, the anemia is mild and only lasts a short while. In people with weakened immune systems, however, either because they have a chronic disease like AIDS or cancer (immunocompromised), or are receiving medication to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressed), such as organ transplant recipients, this anemia can be severe and last long after the infection has subsided. Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, lack of color, lack of energy, and shortness of breath . Some individuals with sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency, a number of different hered- itary blood disorders, and those who have received bone marrow transplantations may be susceptible to develop- ing a potentially life-threatening complication called a transient aplastic crisis where the body is temporarily unable to form new red blood cells.

Botulism is treated in a different way from other bacterial food poisonings. Botulism antitoxin is given to adults, but not infants, if it can be administered within 72 hours after symptoms are first observed. If given later, it provides no benefit. Both infants and adults require hospitalization, often in the intensive care unit. If the ability to breathe is impaired, patients are put on a mechanical ventilator to assist their breathing and are fed intravenously until the paralysis passes. Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners offer the same advice as tradi- tional practitioners concerning diet modification. In addi- tion they recommend taking charcoal tablets,Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus , and citrus seed extract. An electrolyte replacement fluid can be made at home by adding one teaspoon of salt and four teaspoons of sugar to one quart of water. For food poisoning other than botulism, two homeopathic remedies, either Arsenicum album or Nux vomica, are strongly recommended. Prognosis Most cases of food poisoning (except botulism) clear up on their own within one week without medical assistance.

People generally recover without antibiotic treatment, although they may feel tired for a week after the active symptoms subside. Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus is found on humans and in the environment in dust, air, and sewage. The bacteria is spread primarily by food handlers using poor sanitary practices. Almost any food can be contaminated, but salad dressings, milk products, cream pastries, and any food kept at room temperature, rather than hot or cold are likely candidates. It is difficult to estimate the number of cases of food poisoning from Staphylococcus aureus that occur each year, because its symptoms are so similar to those caused by other foodborne bacteria. Many cases are mild and the victim never sees a doctor. Symptoms appear rapidly, usually one to six hours after the contaminated food is eaten. The acute symp- toms of vomiting and severe abdominal cramps without fever usually last only three to six hours and rarely more than 24 hours. Most people recover without medical assistance. Deaths are rare. Escherichia coli (E. coli) There are many strains of E. coli, and not all of them are harmful. The strain that causes most severe food poi- soning is E. coli O157:H7 . Food poisoning by E. coli occurs in three out of every 10,000 people. Foodborne E. coli is found and transmitted mainly in food derived from cows such as raw milk, raw or rare ground beef and fruit or vegetables that are contaminated. Symptoms of food poisoning from E. coli are slower to appear than those caused by some of the other food- borne bacteria. E. coli produces toxins in the large intes- tine rather than higher up in the digestive system. This accounts for the delay in symptoms and the fact that vomiting rarely occurs in E. coli food poisoning. One to three days after eating contaminated food, the victim with E. coli O157:H7begins to have severe abdom- inal cramps and watery diarrhea that usually becomes bloody within 24 hours. There is little or no fever, and rarely does the victim vomit. The bloody, watery diarrhea lasts from one to eight days in uncomplicated cases. Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) According to the FDA,C. jejuniis the leading cause of bacterial diarrhea in the United States. It is responsible for more cases of bacterial diarrhea than Shigella and Salmo- nella combined. Anyone can get food poisoning from C. jejuni, but children under five and young adults between the ages of 15 and 29 are more frequently infected. C. jejuni is carried by healthy cattle, chickens, birds, and flies. It is not carried by healthy people in the United States or Europe. The bacteria is also found ponds and stream water. The ingestion of only a few hundred C. jejuni bacteria can make a person sick. Symptoms of food poisoning begin two to five days after eating food contaminated with C. jejuni . These symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, nausea, headache , muscle pain, and diarrhea. The diarrhea can be watery or sticky and may contain blood. Symptoms last from seven to 10 days, and relapses occur in about one quarter of people who are infected. Dehydration is a common complication. Other complications such as arthritis-like joint pain and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are rare. Shigella Shigella is a common cause of diarrhea in travelers to developing countries. It is associated with contaminat- ed food and water, crowded living conditions, and poor sanitation. The bacterial toxins affect the small intestine. Symptoms of food poisoning by Shigella appear 36\u201372 hours after eating contaminated food. These symp- toms are slightly different from those associated with most foodborne bacteria. In addition to the familiar watery diar- rhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, chills and fever occur. The diarrhea may be quite severe with cramps pro- gressing to classical dysentery. Up to 40% of children with severe infections show neurological symptoms. These include seizures caused by fever, confusion, headache, lethargy, and a stiff neck that resembles meningitis. The disease runs its course usually in two to three days but may last longer. Dehydration is a common com- plication. Most people recover on their own, although they may feel exhausted, but children who are malnour- ished or have weakened immune systems may die. Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) C. botulinum, which causes both adult botulism and infant botulism, is unlike any of the other foodborne bac- teria. First, C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium in that it can only live in the absence of oxygen. Second, the toxins from C. botulinum are neurotoxins.

Once they outgrow their forward facing car seats, children between the ages of four and eight who weigh between 40\u201380 lb (18\u201336 kg) should ride in a booster seat. Every child who rides in a car over this age and weight should buckle up with a properly fitted lap and shoulder belt. \u2022 Teach children pedestrian safety. Younger children should never be allowed to cross the street by them- selves, and older kids should know to follow traffic signs and signals, cross the street at the corner, and look both ways before stepping off the curb. \u2022 Teach children about personal safety. Kids should know what to do in case they get lost or are approached by a stranger. It is also imperative that parents talk openly with their children about their body and sexuality, and what behavior is inappropriate, to protect them against sexual predators. Child-proofing the household is also an important step towards keeping kids healthy. To make a house a safe home: \u2022 Ban guns. Accidental shootings in the home injure an estimated 1,500 children under age 14 each year. If a gun must be in the home, it should be securely locked in a tamper proof box or safe. \u2022 Keep all matches, lighters, and flammable materials properly stored and out of the reach of children. \u2022 Make sure hot water heaters are set to 120 degrees or below to prevent scalding injuries. \u2022 Equip the home with working fire extinguishers and smoke alarms, and teach children what to do in case of fire. \u2022 Secure all medications (including vitamins, herbs, and supplements), hazardous chemicals, and poisonous substances (including alcohol and tobacco). \u2022 Don\u2019t smoke. Aside from causing cancer and other health problems in smokers, second-hand smoke is haz- ardous to a child\u2019s health. \u2022 Keep small children away from poisonous plants out- doors, and remove any indoor plants that are toxic. \u2022 Post the phone numbers of poison control and the pedi- atrician near the phone, and teach children about dial- ing 9-1-1 for emergencies. \u2022 Children under age five should never be left alone in the bathtub, wading pool, or near any standing water source (including an open toilet). Drowning is the lead- ing cause of death by injury for children between the ages of one and four. \u2022 Remove lead paint. Lead is a serious health hazard for children, and houses built before 1978 should be tested for lead paint. If lead is found, the paint should be removed using the appropriate safety precautions. These safety guidelines are not all-inclusive, and there are many age-specific safety precautions that par- ents and guardians of children should observe. For exam- ple, infants should never be left with a propped-up bottle in their mouths or given small play items because of the choking hazards involved. Resources BOOKS Holtzman, Debra Smiley.

Jill Granger David Kaminstein Esophageal acidity test see Esophageal function tests Esophageal aperistalsis see Achalasia Esophageal atresia Definition Esophageal atresia is a serious birth defect in which the esophagus, the long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, is segmented and closed off at any point. This condition usually occurs with tracheoesophageal fistula, a condition in which the esophagus is improperly attached to the trachea, the nearby tube that connects the nasal area to the lungs. Esophageal atresia occurs in approximately 1 in 4,000 live births. Description Failure of an unborn child (fetus) to develop proper- ly results in birth defects. Many of these defects involve organs that do not function, or function only incidentally, before birth, and, as a result, go undetected until the baby is born. In this case, the digestive tract is unnecessary for fetal growth, since all nutrition comes from the mother through the placenta and umbilical cord. During fetal development, the esophagus and the tra- chea arise from the same original tissue. Normally, the two tubes would form separately (differentiate); howev- er, in cases of esphageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas, they do not, resulting in various malformed con- figurations. The most common configuration is the \u201cC\u201d type, in which the upper part of the esophagus abruptly ends in a blind pouch, while the lower part attaches itself to the trachea. This configuration occurs in 85\u201390% of cases. Esophageal atresia without involvement of the tra- chea occurs in only 8% of cases. Causes and symptoms The cause of esophageal atresia, like that of most birth defects, is unknown. An infant born with this defect will at first appear all right, swallowing normally. However, the blind pouch will begin to fill with mucus and saliva that would nor- mally pass through the esophagus to the stomach. These secretions back up into the mouth and nasal area, causing the baby to drool excessively. When fed, the baby will also immediately regurgitate what he or she has eaten. Choking and coughing may also occur as the baby breaths in the fluid backing up from the esophagus. Aspi- ration pneumonia, an infection of the respiratory system caused by inhalation of the contents of the digestive tract, may also develop. Diagnosis Physicians who suspect esophageal atresia after being presented with the above symptoms diagnose the condition using x-ray imaging or by passing a catheter through the nose and into the esophagus. Esophageal atresia is indicated if the catheter hits an obstruction 4\u20135 in (10\u201313 cm) from the nostrils. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1238 Esophageal atresia",

During this time, counseling is usually provided on eating right and starting a light exer- cise program to keep the heart healthy. Patients should eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, grains, and non-fat or low-fat dairy products, and reduce fats to less than 30% of all calories. An exercise program will usually be tailored for the patient, who will be encouraged to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program where exercise will be supervised by professionals. Cardiac rehabilitation pro- grams, offered by hospitals and other organizations, may also include classes on heart-healthy living. Full recovery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three to four months and is a gradual process. Upon release from the hospital, the patient will feel weak because of the extended bed rest in the hospi- tal. Within a few weeks, the patient should begin to feel stronger. While the incision scar from coronary artery bypass graft surgery heals, which takes one to two months, it may be sore. The scar should not be bumped, scratched, or otherwise disturbed. An exercise test is often conduct- ed after the patient leaves the hospital to determine how effective the surgery was and to confirm that progressive exercise is safe.

Patients who have poorer results from coronary artery bypass graft surgery include those over the age of 70, those who have poor left ventricular function, or are undergoing a repeat surgery or other procedures con- currently, and those who continue smoking, do not treat high cholesterol or other coronary risk factors, or have another debilitating disease. Long term, symptoms recur in only about 3\u20134% of patients per year. Five years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, survival expectancy is 90%, at 10 years it is about 80%, at 15 years it is about 55%, and at 20 years it is about 40%. Angina recurs in about 40% of patients after about 10 years. In most cases, it is less severe than before the surgery and can be controlled by drug therapy. In patients who have had vein grafts, 40% of the grafts are severely obstructed 10 years after the procedure. Repeat coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be necessary, and is usu- ally less successful than the first surgery. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery There are two new types of minimally invasive coro- nary artery bypass graft surgery: port-access coronary artery bypass (also called PACAB or PortCAB) and min- imally invasive coronary artery bypass (also called MID- CAB). These procedures are minimally invasive because they do not require the neck-to-navel incision, sawing through the breastbone, or opening the rib cage to expose the heart. Both procedures enable surgeons to work on the coronary arteries through small chest holes called ports and other small incisions. Port-access coronary artery bypass requires the use of a heart-lung machine but minimally invasive coronary artery bypass does not. Advantages of these procedures over standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery include a shorter hospital stay, a shorter recovery period, and lower costs. Port-access coronary artery bypass enables surgeons to perform bypasses through smaller incisions. Using a video monitor to view the procedure, the surgeon passes instruments through ports in the patient\u2019s chest to per- form the bypass. Mammary arteries or leg veins are used for the grafts. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass is performed on a beating heart and is appropriate only for bypasses of one or two arteries. Small ports are made in the patient\u2019s chest, along with a small incision directly over the coronary artery to be bypassed. Generally, the surgeon uses a mammary artery for the bypass. Early data on outcomes for port-access coronary artery bypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are favorable. Mortality rates with port-access coronary artery bypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are both less than 3%\u2014about the same as in standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery. One clinical trial indicated that survival at seven years was the same in minimally invasive coronary artery bypass and standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but that another intervention was necessary five times more often with minimally invasive coronary artery bypass than with standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The American Heart Association Council on Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery feels that both pro- cedures appear promising but that further study is needed. More data covering longer term outcomes are necessary in order to fully assess these procedures. Preparation The patient is usually admitted to the hospital the day before the coronary artery bypass graft surgery is scheduled. Coronary angiography has been previously performed to show the surgeon where the arteries are blocked and where the grafts might best be positioned. The patient is given a blood-thinning drug\u2014usually heparin\u2014that helps to prevent blood clots. The evening before the surgery, the patient showers with antiseptic soap and is shaved from chin to toes. After midnight, food and fluids are restricted. A sedative is prescribed on the morning of surgery and sometimes the night before. Heart monitoring begins. Aftercare The patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit for at least the first two days after the surgery. He or she is connected to chest and breathing tubes, a mechanical venti- lator, a heart monitor and other monitoring equipment, and a urinary catheter. The breathing tube and ventilator are usually removed within six hours of surgery, but the other tubes remain in place as long as the patient is in the inten- sive care unit. Drugs are prescribed to control pain and to prevent unwanted blood clotting. The patient is closely monitored. Vital signs and other parameters, such as heart sounds and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterial blood, are checked frequently. The chest tube is checked to ensure that it is draining properly. The patient is fed intra- venously for the first day or two. Daily doses of aspirinare started within six to 24 hours after the procedure. Chest physiotherapy is started after the ventilator and breathing tube are removed. The therapy includes coughing, turning frequently, and taking deep breaths. Other exercises will be encouraged to improve the patient\u2019s circulation and prevent complications due to prolonged bed rest. If there are no complications, the patient begins to resume a normal routine around the second day. This includes eating regular food, sitting up, and walking GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 927 Coronary artery bypass graft surgery",

It is less invasive and less expensive than coronary artery bypass surgery. In coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or vein from an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build a detour around the coronary artery blockage. The healthy vessel then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Bypass surgery is major surgery. It is appropriate for those patients with blockages in two or three major coro- nary arteries, those with severely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and those who have not responded to other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen- eral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to support the patient while the healthy vein or artery is attached past the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% of patients who have bypass surgery experience full relief from angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Only about 3\u20134% of patients per year experience a return of symptoms. Survival rates after bypass surgery decrease over time. At five years after surgery, survival expectancy is 90%; at 10 years about 80%, at 15 years about 55%, and at 20 years about 40%. Three semi-experimental surgical procedures for unblocking coronary arteries are currently being studied. Atherectomy is a procedure in which the cardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque from the blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is inserted into the affected artery to burn or break down the plaque. A metal coil called a stent can be implanted per- manently to keep a blocked artery open. Stenting is becoming more common. Alternative treatment Natural therapies may reduce the risk of certain types of heart disease, but once symptoms appear, con- ventional medical attention is necessary. A healthy diet (including cold-water fish as a source of essential fatty acids) and exercise, important components of conven- tional prevention and treatment strategies, also are emphasized in alternative approaches to coronary artery disease. Herbal medicine has a variety of remedies that may have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease. For example, ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) may help reduce cholesterol. Garlic ( Allium sativum ), ginger, and hot red or chili peppers are all circulatory enhancers that can help prevent blood clots. Yoga and other bodywork, massage, relaxation therapies, and talking therapies may also help prevent coronary artery disease and stop, or even reverse, the progression of atherosclerosis. Vitamin and mineral therapy to reduce, reverse, or protect against coronary artery disease includes chromium; calcium and magnesium; B-complex vitamins; the anti-oxidant vita- mins C and E; selenium; and zinc. Traditional Chinese medicine may recommend herbal remedies, massage, acupuncture, and dietary modification. Prognosis In many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc- cessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death rates from coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s. New diagnostic techniques enable doctors to identify and treat coronary artery disease in its earliest stages. New tech- nologies and surgical procedures have extended the lives of many patients who would otherwise have died. Research on coronary artery disease continues. Prevention A healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery disease and help keep it from progressing. A heart- healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, moderate drinking, no recreational drugs, controlling hypertension, and managing stress. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are excellent to help prevent recurring coronary problems for people who are at risk and who have had coronary events and procedures. Eat right A healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are low in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol, and high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta- bles and limited sodium. Some foods are low in fat but high in cholesterol and some are low in cholesterol but high in fat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol and, in exces- sive amounts, increases the amount of the clot-forming proteins in blood. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are good for the heart. Fat should comprise no more than 30% of total daily calories. Cholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is found in foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal products. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fiber can help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per day. Many popular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol by an average of 25\u201330% when used with a low-fat, low-cho- lesterol diet. Fruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are low-calorie and nearly fat free. Vita- min C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits and veg- etables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into a form that damages coronary arteries.

          "content": "Procedure The surgery team for coronary artery bypass graft surgery includes the cardiovascular surgeon, assisting sur- geons, a cardiovascular anesthesiologist, a perfusion tech- nologist (who operates the heart-lung machine), and spe- cially trained nurses. After general anesthesia is adminis- tered, the surgeon removes the veins or prepares the arter- ies for grafting. If the saphenous vein is to be used, a series of incisions are made in the patient\u2019s thigh or calf. More commonly, a segment of the internal mammary artery will be used and the incisions are made in the chest wall. The surgeon then makes an incision from the patient\u2019s neck to navel, saws through the breastbone, and retracts the rib cage open to expose the heart. The patient is connected to a heart-lung machine, also called a cardiopulmonary bypass pump, that cools the body to reduce the need for oxygen and takes over for the heart and lungs during the procedure. The heart is then stopped and a cold solution of potassium-enriched normal saline is injected into the aor- tic root and the coronary arteries to lower the temperature of the heart, which prevents damage to the tissue. Next, a small opening is made just below the block- age in the diseased coronary artery. Blood will be redirect- ed through this opening once the graft is sewn in place. If a leg vein is used, one end is connected to the coronary artery and the other to the aorta. If a mammary artery is used, one end is connected to the coronary artery while the other remains attached to the aorta. The procedure is repeated on as many coronary arteries as necessary. Most patients who have coronary artery bypass graft surgery have at least three grafts done during the procedure. Electric shocks start the heart pumping again after the grafts have been completed. The heart-lung machine is turned off and the blood slowly returns to normal body temperature. After implanting pacing electrodes (if need- ed) and inserting a chest tube, the surgeon closes the chest cavity. Success rate of coronary artery bypass graft surgery About 90% of patients experience significant improve- ments after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients experience full relief from chest pain and resume their nor- mal activities in about 70% of the cases; the remaining 20% experience partial relief. In 5\u201310% of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries, the bypass graft stops supplying blood to the bypassed artery within one year.

Next, the surgeon removes the fat and cholesterol buildup, along with any blood clots that have formed, with a blunt dissecting instrument. Then the surgeon bathes the clean wall in salt solution combined with heparin, an anticoagulant. Then the surgeon stitches the artery just enough so that the bypass shunt tube can be removed, and then he/she stitches the artery completely closed. After checking to make sure no blood is leaking, the surgeon next closes the skin incision with stitches. The operation should improve symptoms, although its long-term effects may be more limited, since arterial narrowing is rarely confined to one area of one artery. If narrowing is a problem throughout the body, arterial reconstructive surgery may be required. The total cost of an endarterectomy, including diag- nostic tests, surgery, hospitalization, and follow-up care, will vary according to hospital, doctor, and area of the country where the operation is performed, but a patient can expect to pay in the range of $15,000. Patients who are very young, very old, or very ill, or who need more extensive surgery, may require more expensive treatment. Preparation Before surgery, the doctor pinpoints the location of the narrowed artery with an x-ray procedure called angiography . For surgery to be effective, the degree of narrowing should be at least 70%, but it should not be total. Patients undergoing angiography are given a local anesthetic, but the endarterectomy itself requires the use of a general anesthesia. Aftercare After the surgery, the patient spends the first two days lying flat in bed. Patients who have had carotid endarterectomy should not bend the neck sharply during this time. Because the blood flow to the brain is now greatly increased, patients may experience a brief but severe headache , or lightheadedness.

Maureen Haggerty Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Definition Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a surgical procedure in which one or more blocked coronary arter- ies are bypassed by a blood vessel graft to restore normal blood flow to the heart. These grafts usually come from the patient\u2019s own arteries and veins located in the leg, arm, or chest. Purpose Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called coronary artery bypass surgery, CABG, and bypass oper- ation) is performed to restore blood flow to the heart. This relieves chest pain and ischemia , improves the patient\u2019s quality of life, and in some cases, prolongs the patient\u2019s life. The goals of the procedure are to enable the patient to resume a normal lifestyle and to lower the risk of a heart attack. The decision to perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a complex one, and there is some disagreement among experts as to when it is indicated. Many experts feel that it has been performed too frequently in the Unit- ed States. According to the American Heart Association, appropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery include patients with blockages in at least three major coronary arteries, especially if the blockages are in arteries that feed the heart\u2019s left ventricle; patients with angina so severe that even mild exertion causes chest pain; and patients who cannot tolerate percutaneous trans- luminal coronary angioplasty and do not respond well to drug therapy. It is well accepted that coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with severe coronary artery disease (three or more dis- eased arteries with impaired function in the left ventricle). Precautions Coronary artery bypass graft surgery should ideally be postponed for three months after a heart attack. Patients should be medically stable before the surgery, if possible. Description Coronary artery bypass graft surgery builds a detour around one or more blocked coronary arteries with a graft from a healthy vein or artery. The graft goes around the clogged artery (or arteries) to create new pathways for oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery performed in a hospital. The length of the procedure depends upon the number of arteries being bypassed, but it generally takes from four to six hours\u2014sometimes longer. The average hospital stay is four to seven days. Full recov- ery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three to four months. Within four to six weeks, people with seden- tary office jobs can return to work; people with physical jobs must wait longer and sometimes change careers. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is widely per- formed in the United States. The American Heart Associ- ation estimates that 573,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were performed on 363,000 patients in 1995. Seventy-four percent of these procedures were per- formed on men and 44% on men and women under the age of 65 (1995 data). The estimated average cost of this procedure in 1995 was $44,820.

          "content": "CABG surgery see Coronary artery bypass graft surgery CAD see Coronary artery disease Caffeine Definition Caffeine is a drug that stimulates the central nervous system. Purpose Caffeine makes people more alert, less drowsy, and improves coordination. Combined with certain pain relievers or medicines for treating migraine headache , caffeine makes those drugs work more quickly and effec- tively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve headaches. Antihistamines are sometimes combined with caffeine to counteract the drowsiness that those drugs cause. Caf- feine is also sometimes used to treat other conditions, including breathing problems in newborns and in young babies after surgery. Description Caffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate. Colas and some other soft drinks contain it. Caffeine also comes in tablet and capsule forms and can be bought without a prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include No Doz, Overtime, Pep-Back, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, and Vivarin. Some pain relievers, medicines for migraine headaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine. Recommended dosage Adults and children age 12 years and over 100\u2013200 mg no more than every 3\u20134 hours. In timed-release form, the dose is 200\u2013250 mg once a day. Timed-release forms should not be taken less than six hours before bedtime. Children under 12 years Not recommended. Other considerations Avoid taking too much caffeine when it is being taken as an over-the-counter drug. Consider how much caffeine is being taken in from coffee, tea, chocolate, soft drinks, and other foods that contain caffeine. Check with a pharmacist or physician to find out how much caffeine is safe to use. Precautions Caffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be used regularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to more seri- ous sleep disorders, like insomnia. People who use large amounts of caffeine over long periods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens, they have to use more and more caffeine to get the same effects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence. If the person then stops using caffeine abruptly, with- drawal symptoms may occur. These can include throb- bing headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, yawning, irritabili- ty, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symp- toms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is avoid- ed. Then the symptoms usually disappear. If taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere with sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person from falling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night. The notion that caffeine helps people sober up after drinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact, using caf- feine and alcohol together is not a good idea. The combi- nation can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting. Older people may be more sensitive to caffeine and thus more likely to have certain side effects, such as irri- tability, nervousness, anxiety, and sleep problems.

          "content": "Description Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feel- ings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical and mental deterioration, they become what are known as depressive disorders. Each year in the United States, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17 million people at an approximate annual direct and indirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like- ly to experience an episode of severe depression in her lifetime, with a 10\u201320% lifetime prevalence, com- pared to 5\u201310% for men. The average age a first depressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, although the disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately, from children to the elderly. There are two main categories of depressive disor- ders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depressive disorder is a moderate to severe episode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi- viduals experiencing this major depressive episode may have trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they once took pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif- ficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, or have a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children, the major depression may appear as irritability. While major depressive episodes may be acute (intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo- ing, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (one or more years in children) and has an average duration of 16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymic disorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflicted with the disorder may experience some periods of nor- mal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length. Its onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not be able to pinpoint exactly when they started feeling depressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder may experience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, low self-esteem, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness. Depression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n affective mental illness that causes radical emotional changes and mood swings, from manic highs to depres- sive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. Causes and symptoms The causes behind depression are complex and not yet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu- rotransmitters\u2014the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cell\u2014 is believed to be key to depression, external factors such as upbringing (more so in dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor- tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is abused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles- cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking may emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depression may follow. Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops depressive disorders. Individuals with major depression in their immediate family are up to three times more likely to have the disorder themselves. It would seem that biological and genetic factors may make certain individuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor- ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig- ger the disorder. External stressors and significant life changes, such as chronic medical problems, death of a loved one, divorce or estrangement, miscarriage , or loss of a job, can also result in a form of depression known as adjust- ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder usually resolve themselves, occasionally they may evolve into a major depressive disorder. Major depressive episode Individuals experiencing a major depressive episode have a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest or pleasure in activities. Children experiencing a major depressive episode may appear or feel irritable rather than depressed. In addition, five or more of the following symptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri- od of at least two weeks: \u2022 Significant change in weight. \u2022 Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep). \u2022 Psychomotor agitation or retardation. \u2022 Fatigue or loss of energy. \u2022 Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt. \u2022 Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci- siveness. \u2022 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal and/or suicide attempts.

Prognosis Untreated or improperly treated depression is the number one cause of suicide in the United States. Proper treatment relieves symptoms in 80\u201390% of depressed patients. After each major depressive episode, the risk of recurrence climbs significantly\u201450% after one episode, 70% after two episodes, and 90% after three episodes. For this reason, patients need to be aware of the symp- toms of recurring depression and may require long-term maintenance treatment of antidepressants and/or therapy. Prevention Patient education in the form of therapy or self-help groups is crucial for training patients with depressive dis- orders to recognize symptoms of depression and to take an active part in their treatment program. Extended main- tenance treatment with antidepressants may be required in some patients to prevent relapse. Early intervention with children with depression is effective in arresting development of more severe problems. Resources BOOKS American Psychiatric Association.

          "content": "Dysthymic disorder Dysthymia commonly occurs in tandem with other psychiatric and physical conditions. Up to 70% of dys- thymic patients have both dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder, known as double depression. Sub- stance abuse, panic disorders, personality disorders , social phobias, and other psychiatric conditions are also found in many dysthymic patients. Dysthymia is prevalent in patients with certain medical conditions, including mul- tiple sclerosis, AIDS, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and post-car- diac transplantation. The connection between dysthymic disorder and these medical conditions is unclear, but it may be related to the way the medical condition and/or its pharmacological treatment affects neurotransmitters. Dys- thymic disorder can lengthen or complicate the recovery of patients also suffering from medical conditions. Along with an underlying feeling of depression, people with dysthymic disorder experience two or more of the following symptoms on an almost daily basis for a period for two or more years (most suffer for five years), or one year or more for children: \u2022 under or overeating \u2022 insomnia or hypersomnia \u2022 low energy or fatigue \u2022 low self-esteem \u2022 poor concentration or trouble making decisions \u2022 feelings of hopelessness Diagnosis In addition to an interview, several clinical invento- ries or scales may be used to assess a patient\u2019s mental status and determine the presence of depressive symp- toms. Among these tests are: the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Child Depression Inventory (CDI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Zung Self-Rating Scale for Depression. These tests may be administered in an out- patient or hospital setting by a general practitioner, social worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist. Treatment Major depressive and dysthymic disorders are typi- cally treated with antidepressants or psychosocial thera- py. Psychosocial therapy focuses on the personal and interpersonal issues behind depression, while antidepres- sant medication is prescribed to provide more immediate relief for the symptoms of the disorder. When used together correctly, therapy and antidepressants are a powerful treatment plan for the depressed patient. Antidepressants Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) reduce depression by increasing levels of serotonin, a neuro- transmitter. Some clinicians prefer SSRIs for treatment of dysthymic disorder.

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are less expensive than SSRIs, but have more severe side-effects, which may include persistent dry mouth, sedation, dizziness , and cardiac arrhythmias.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS) such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to avoid potentially serious hypertensive side effects. Heterocyclics include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tra- zodone (Desyrel). Bupropion should not be prescribed to patients with a seizure disorder. Side effects of the drug may include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, low blood pressure, and insomnia. Because trazodone has a sedative effect, it is useful in treating depressed patients with insom- nia. Other possible side effects of trazodone include dry mouth, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and headache. Psychosocial therapy Psychotherapy explores an individual\u2019s life to bring to light possible contributing causes of the present depression. During treatment, the therapist helps the patient to become self-aware of his or her thinking pat- terns and how they came to be. There are several differ- ent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the common goal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv- ing and coping skills. Cognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the patient\u2019s faulty thinking is causing the current depression and focuses on changing the depressed patient\u2019s thought patterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patient identify negative or distorted thought patterns and the emotions and behavior that accompany them, and then retrains the depressed individual to recognize the think- ing and react differently to it. Electroconvulsant therapy ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy , is usually employed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatment options have been explored. However, it is sometimes used early in treatment when severe depression is present and the patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient is becoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic. The treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses that move into the brain through electrodes on the patient\u2019s head. ECT is given under general anesthesia and patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre- vent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behind the success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed that the electrical current modifies the electrochemical processes of the brain, consequently relieving depres- sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusion are possible side effects immediately following an ECT procedure. Memory loss, typically transient, has also been reported in ECT patients. Alternative treatment St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum ) is used throughout Europe to treat depressive symptoms. Unlike traditional prescription antidepressants, this herbal anti- depressant has few reported side effects. Some users may experience high blood pressure, headaches, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting. As of early 1998, United States. clinical trials organized by the National Institute of Men- tal Health were still in the planning phase. Its efficacy in severe depression is very uncertain. Homeopathic treatment can also be very therapuetic in treating depression.

          "content": "Treatment Treating conduct disorder requires an approach that addresses both the child and his environment. Behavioral therapy and psychotherapy can help a child with CD to control his anger and develop new coping skills. Family group therapy may also be effective in some cases. Par- ents should be counseled on how to set appropriate limits with their child and be consistent and realistic when dis- ciplining. If an abusive home life is at the root of the con- duct problem, every effort should be made to move the child into a more supportive environment. Parent training programs are increasing in number. For children with coexisting ADHD, substance abuse, depression, or learning disorders , treating these conditions first is preferred, and may result in a signifi- cant improvement to the CD condition. In all cases of CD, treatment should begin when symptoms first appear. Recent studies have shown Ritalin to be a useful drug for both ADHD and CD. When aggressive behavior is severe, mood stabi- lizing medication, including lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs), car- bamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), and propranolol (Inderal), may be an appropriate option for treating the aggressive symptoms. However, placing the child into a structured setting or treatment program such as a psy- chiatric hospital may be just as beneficial for easing aggression as medication. Prognosis The prognosis for children with CD is not bright. Follow-up studies of conduct disordered children have shown a high incidence of antisocial personality disor- der, affective illnesses, and chronic criminal behavior later in life. However, proper treatment of co-existing disorders, early identification and intervention, and long-term support may improve the outlook signifi- cantly.

Prevention A supportive, nurturing, and structured home envi- ronment is believed to be the best defense against CD. Children with learning disabilities and/or difficulties in school should get immediate and appropriate academic assistance. Addressing these problems when they first appear helps to prevent the frustration and low self- esteem that may lead to CD later on.

          "content": "Eye muscle surgery Definition Eye muscle surgery is surgery to weaken, strength- en, or reposition any of the muscles that move the eyeball (the extraocular muscles). Purpose The purpose of eye muscle surgery is generally to align the pair of eyes so that they gaze in the same direc- tion and move together as a team, either to improve appearance or to aid in the development of binocular vision in a young child. To achieve binocular vision, the goal is to align the eyes so that the location of the image on the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of the image on the retina of the other eye. In addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help people with other eye disorders ( nystagmus and Duane syndrome, for example). Precautions Depth perception (stereopsis) develops around the age of three months old. For successful development of binocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen- sionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the age of four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, so an early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even be performed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu- lar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis- es (vision therapy) will probably be necessary. Description The extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the sclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering of the eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginary equator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye. The other end of each of these muscles attaches to a part of the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These muscles enable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or the other, or any angle in between. Normally both eyes move together, receive the same image on corresponding locations on both retinas, and the brain fuses these images into one three-dimensional image. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder where one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, most often outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose (esotropia). The brain now receives two different images, and either suppresses one or the person sees double (diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakening or strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyes toward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward, the muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened. Rarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people with nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con- dition where one or both eyes move rapidly or oscillate; it can sometimes be helped by moving the eyes to the posi- tion of least oscillation. Duane syndrome is a disorder where there is limited horizontal eye movement; it can sometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle. There are two methods to alter extraocular muscles. Traditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, or reposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon first makes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membrane covering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle to prevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle from the eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, the muscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle is removed so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle is reattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle. In a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition- ing it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might be operated on at the same time. Another way of weakening eye muscles, using botu- linum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced in the early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off, the realignment may be permanent, depending upon whether neurological connections for binocular vision were established during the time the toxin was active. This technique can also be used to adjust a muscle after traditional surgery. The cost of eye muscle surgery is about $2,000\u2013 $4,000, and about 700,000 surgeries are performed annu- ally in the United States. Preparation Patients should make sure their doctors are aware of any medications that they are taking, even over-the- counter medications. Patients should not take aspirin,o r any other blood-thinning medications for ten days prior to surgery, and should not eat or drink after midnight the night before. Aftercare Patients will need someone to drive them home after their surgery. They should continue to avoid aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for an addi- tional three days, but they can take acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol). Patients should discuss this with the surgeon to be clear what medications they can or cannot take. Pain will subside after two to three days, and patients can resume most normal activities within a few days. Again, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1269 Eye muscle surgery",

Diagnosis Exophthalmos is obvious when it is advanced enough to cause complications. When there is doubt in the early stages, a mechanical device called an exoph- thalmometer can measure the protrusion. Computed tomography scans (CT scans) are of great value in examining the bony components of the orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is equally valuable for displaying the contents of the orbit, because it \u201csees through\u201d the bone. Treatment If a tumor is growing behind the eye, it needs to be removed. If Graves\u2019 disease is the cause, it may subside with treatment of the overactive thyroid, but this is not guaranteed. Local care to the front of the eye to keep it moist is necessary if the eyelid cannot close. Prognosis Exophthalmos can be progressive. Its progress must be carefully followed, treating complications as they occur. Prevention Vision can usually be preserved with attentive treat- ment.

          "content": "research is needed to try to harness the benefits of inflix- imab, while avoiding the potential complications. Serious cases of malabsorption/malnutrition may need to be treated by providing nutritional supplements. These supplements must be in a form that can be absorbed from the damaged, inflamed intestine. Some patients find that certain foods are hard to digest, includ- ing milk, large quantities of fiber, and spicy foods. When patients are suffering from an obstruction, or during peri- ods of time when symptoms of the disease are at their worst, they may need to drink specially formulated, high- calorie liquid supplements. Those patients who are severely ill may need to receive their nutrition through a needle inserted in a vein (intravenously), or even by a tiny tube (a catheter) inserted directly into a major vein in the chest. A number of medications are available to help decrease the cramping and pain associated with Crohn\u2019s disease. These include loperamide, tincture of opium, and codeine. Some fiber preparations (methylcellulose or psyllium) may be helpful, although some patients do not tolerate them well. The first step in treating an obstruction involves gen- eral attempts to decrease inflammation with sul- fasalazine, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. A patient with a severe obstruction will have to stop taking all food and drink by mouth, allowing the bowel to \u201crest.\u201d Abscesses and other infections will require antibi- otics. Surgery may be required to repair an obstruction that does not resolve on its own, to remove an abscess, or to repair a fistula. Such surgery may involve the removal of a section of the intestine. In extremely severe cases of Crohn\u2019s disease that do not respond to treatment, a patient may need to have the entire large intestine removed (an operation called a colectomy). In this case, a piece of the remaining small intestine is pulled through an opening in the abdomen. This bit of intestine is fash- ioned surgically to allow a special bag to be placed over it. This bag catches the body\u2019s waste, which no longer can be passed through the large intestine and out of the anus. This opening, which will remain in place for life, is called an ileostomy. Prognosis Crohn\u2019s disease is a life-long illness. The severity of the disease can vary, and a patient can experience periods of time when the disease is not active and he or she is symptom-free. However, the complications and risks of Crohn\u2019s disease tend to increase over time. Well over 60% of all patients with Crohn\u2019s disease will require surgery, and about half of these patients will require more than one operation over time. About 5\u201310% of all Crohn\u2019s patients will die of their disease, primarily due to massive infection.

Croup is usually not serious, and most children recover within a few days. In a small percentage of cases, a child develops breathing difficulties and may need medical attention. Description At one time, the term croup was primarily associated with diphtheria, a life-threatening respiratory infection.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

          "content": "exposed to microorganisms and environmental agents that can cause infections or allergic reactions. Conjunc- tivitis can be acute or chronic depending upon how long the condition lasts, the severity of symptoms, and the type of organism or agent involved. It can also affect one or both eyes and, if caused by infection, can be very easi- ly transmitted to others during close physical contact, particularly among children in a daycare center. Other names for conjunctivitis include pink eye and red eye. Causes and symptoms Conjunctivitis may be caused by a viral infection, such as a cold, acute respiratory infection, or disease such as measles, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. Symp- toms include mild to severe discomfort in one or both eyes, redness, swelling of the eyelids, and watery, yellow, or green discharge. Symptoms may last anywhere from several days to two weeks. Infection with an adenovirus, however, may also cause a significant amount of pus-like discharge and a scratchy, foreign body-type of sensation in the eye. This may also be accompanied by swelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes near the ear. Bacterial conjunctivitis can occur in adults and chil- dren and is caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus , and Hemophilus . Symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis include a pus-like discharge and crusty eyelids after awakening. Redness of the conjunctiva can be mild to severe and may be accompanied by swelling. Persons with symptoms of conjunctivitis who are sexual- ly active may possibly be infected with the bacteria that cause either gonorrhea or chlamydia. There may be large amounts of pus-like discharge, and symptoms may include intolerance to light (photophobia), watery mucous discharge, and tenderness in the lymph nodes near the ear that may persist for up to three months. Conjunctivitis may also be caused by environmental hazards, such as wind, smoke, dust, and allergic reac- tions caused by pollen, dust, or grass. Symptoms range from itching and redness to a mucous discharge. Persons who wear contact lenses may develop allergic conjunc- tivitis caused by the various eye solutions and foreign proteins contained in them. Other less common causes of conjunctivitis include exposure to sun lamps or the electrical arcs used during welding, and problems with inadequate drainage of the tear ducts. Diagnosis An accurate diagnosis of conjunctivitis centers on taking a patient history to learn when symptoms began, how long the condition has been going on, the symptoms experienced, and other predisposing factors, such as upper respiratory complaints, allergies, sexually trans- mitted diseases, herpes simplex infections, and exposure to persons with pink eye. It may be helpful to learn whether an aspect of an individual\u2019s occupation may be the cause, for example, welding. Diagnostic tests are usu- ally not indicated unless initial treatment fails or an infec- tion with gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected. In such cases, the discharge may be cultured and Gram stained to determine the organism responsible for causing the condi- tion. Cultures and smears are relatively painless. Treatment The treatment of conjunctivitis depends on what caused the condition. In all cases, warm compresses applied to the affected eye several times a day may help to reduce discomfort. Conjunctivitis due to a viral infection, particularly those due to adenoviruses, are usually treated by applying warm compresses to the eye(s) and applying topical antibi- otic ointments to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Viral conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Topical steroids are com- monly prescribed in combination with antiviral therapy. In cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, a physician may prescribe an antibiotic eye ointment or eye drops contain- ing sodium sulfacetamide (Sulamyd) to be applied daily for seven to 14 days. If, after 72 hours, the condition does not improve, a physician or primary care provider should be notified because the bacteria involved may be resistant to the antibiotic used or the cause may not be bacterial. For cases of conjunctivitis caused by a gonococcal organism, a physician may prescribe an intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and a topical antibi- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 903 Conjunctivitis This person has severe conjunctivitis, most likely caused by an allergic reaction.

With accompanying chlamydia infection, a topical antibiotic ointment containing erythromycin (Ilotycin) may be prescribed to be applied 1-2 times daily. In addi- tion, oral erythromycin or tetracycline therapy may be indicated for three to four weeks. Here again, sexual partners should also be treated. Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated by removing the allergic substance from a person\u2019s environment, if possible; by applying cool compresses to the eye; and by administering eye drops four to six times daily for four days. Also, the antihistamine diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) may help to relieve itchy eyes. Alternative treatment Conjunctivitis caused by gonococcal and chlamydial infection usually requires conventional medical treat- ment. With bacterial, viral, and allergic conjunctivitis, however, alternative options can be helpful. Internal immune enhancement with supplementation can aid in the resolution of bacterial and viral conjunctivitis. Removal of the allergic agent is an essential step in treat- ing allergic conjunctivitis. As with any of the recom- mended treatments, however, if no improvement is seen within 48\u201372 hours, a physician should be consulted. Homeopathically, there are a number of acute reme- dies designed to treat conjunctivitis. These include Pul- satilla (windflower, Pulsatilla nigricans ), Belladonna , and eyebright ( Euphrasia officinalis ). Eye drops, pre- pared with homeopathic remedies and/or herbs, can be a good substitute for pharmaceutical eye drops. Eye washes can also be made. Herbal eyewashes made with eyebright (1 tsp. dried herb steeped in 1 pint of boiling water) or chamomile (Matricaria recutita; 2\u20133 tsp in 1 pt of boiling water) may be helpful. Eyewashes should be strained and cooled before use, and close attention should be paid to make sure that any solution put into the eye is sterile. Other simple home remedies may help relieve the discomfort associated with conjunctivitis. A boric acid eyewash can be used to clean and soothe the eyes. A warm compress applied to the eyes for five to 10 minutes three times a day can help relieve the discomfort of bac- terial and viral conjunctivitis. A cool compress or cool, damp tea bags placed on the eyes can ease the discomfort of allergic conjunctivitis. Prognosis If treated properly, the prognosis for conjunctivitis is good. Conjunctivitis caused by an allergic reaction should clear up once the allergen is removed. However, allergic conjunctivitis will likely recur if the individual again comes into contact with the particular allergen. Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or a virus, if treated properly, is usually resolved in 10\u201314 days. If there is no relief of symptoms in 48\u201372 hours, or there is moderate to severe eye pain, changes in vision, or the conjunctivi- tis is suspected to be caused by herpes simplex, a physi- cian should be notified immediately. If untreated or if treatment fails and is not corrected, conjunctivitis may cause visual impairment by spreading to other parts of the eye, such as the cornea. Prevention Conjunctivitis can, in many cases, be prevented, or at least the course of the disease can be shortened by fol- lowing some simple practices. \u2022 Frequently wash hands using antiseptic soap, and use single-use towels during the disease to prevent spread- ing the infection. \u2022 Avoid chemical irritants and known allergens. \u2022 If in an area where welding occurs, use the proper pro- tective eye wear and screens to prevent damaging the eyes. \u2022 Use a clean tissue to remove discharge from eyes, and wash hands to prevent the spread of infection. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 904 Conjunctivitis Eyelid Conjunctiva Cornea Lens Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva, a thin, delicate membrane that covers the eyeball and lines the eyelid.

          "content": "\u2022 Fecal bacteria are more likely to be able to infect the cornea. \u2022 A bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which can contaminate eyedrops, is particularly able to cause corneal infection. \u2022 A group of incomplete bacteria known as Chlamydia can be transmitted to the eye directly by flies or dirty hands. One form of chlamydial infection is the leading cause of blindness in developing countries and is known as Egyptian ophthalmia or trachoma. Another type of Chlamydia causes a sexually transmitted disease. \u2022 Other sexually transmitted diseases\u2014for example, syphilis\u2014can affect the cornea. The most common viruses to damage the cornea are adenoviruses and herpes viruses. Viral and fungal infec- tions are often caused by improper use of topical corti- costeroids. If topical corticosteroids are used in a patient with herpes simplex keratitis, the ulcer can get much worse and blindness could result. Symptoms are obvious. The cornea is intensely sen- sitive, so corneal ulcers normally produce severe pain. If the corneal ulcer is centrally located, vision is impaired or completely absent. Tearing is present and the eye is red. It hurts to look at bright lights. Diagnosis The doctor will take a case history to try to deter- mine the cause of the ulcer. This can include improper use of contact lenses; injury, such as a scratch from a twig; or severe dry eye. An instrument called a slit lamp will be used to examine the cornea. The slit lamp is a microscope with a light source that magnifies the cornea, allowing the extent of the ulcer to be seen. Fluorescein, a yellow dye, may be used to illuminate further detail. If a germ is responsible for the ulcer, identification may require scraping samples directly from the cornea, con- junctiva, and lids, and sending them to the laboratory. KEY TERMS Fluorescein \u2014A fluorescent chemical used to examine the cornea. Germ\u2014A disease-causing microorganism. Inflammation\u2014The body\u2019s reaction to irritation. Topical corticosteroids \u2014Cortisone and related drugs used on the skin and in the eye, usually for allergic conditions. Treatment A corneal ulcer needs to be treated aggressively, as it can result in loss of vision. The first step is to eliminate infection. Broad spectrum antibiotics will be used before the lab results come back. Medications may then be changed to more specifically target the cause of the infection. A combination of medications may be neces- sary. Patients should return for their follow-up visits so that the doctor can monitor the healing process. The cornea can heal from many insults, but if it remains scarred, corneal transplantation may be necessary to restore vision. If the corneal ulcer is large, hospitaliza- tion may be necessary. Prognosis Treated early enough, corneal infections will usually resolve, perhaps even without the formation of an ulcer. However, left untreated, infections can lead to ulcers and the corneal ulcer can result in scarring or perforation of the cornea. Other problems may occur as well, including glaucoma . Patients with certain systemic diseases that impede healing (such as diabetes mellitus or rheuma- toid arthritis) may need more aggressive treatment. The later the treatment, the more damage will be done and the more scarring will result. Corneal transplant is standard treatment with a high probability of success. Prevention Attentive care of contact lenses will greatly reduce the incidence of corneal damage and ulceration. Germs that cause no problems in the mouth or on the hands can damage the eye, so contact lens wearers must wash their hands before touching their lenses and must not use sali- va to moisten them. Tap water should not be used to rinse the lenses. Contacts should be removed whenever there is irritation and left out until the eyes are back to normal. It is not advisable to wear contact lenses while swim- ming or in hot tubs. Daily wear contact lenses have been found to be less of a risk than contacts for overnight wear (extended wear). Organisms have been cultured from contact lens cases, so the cases should be rinsed in hot water and allowed to air dry. Cases should be replaced every three months. Patients should follow their doctors\u2019 schedules for replacement of the contacts. Eye protection in the workplace, or wherever tiny particles are flying around, is essential. Ultraviolet (UV) coatings on glasses or sunglasses can help protect the eyes from the sun\u2019s rays. Goggles with UV protection should be worn when skiing or in suntanning salons to protect against UV rays. Prompt attention to any red eye should prevent progressive damage.

Lisa Papp, RN Consciousness disorders see Coma Constipation Definition Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in which bowel movements occur less often than usual or consist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to pass. Bowel habits vary, but an adult who has not had a bowel movement in three days or a child who has not had a bowel movement in four days is considered constipated. Description Constipation is one of the most common medical complaints in the United States. Constipation can occur at any age, and is more common among individuals who resist the urge to move their bowels at their body\u2019s sig- nal. This often happens when children start school or enter daycare and feel shy about asking permission to use the bathroom. Constipation is more common in women than in men and is especially apt to occur during pregnancy . Age alone does not increase the frequency of constipa- tion, but elderly people (especially women) are more likely to suffer from constipation. Although this condition is rarely serious, it can lead to: \u2022 bowel obstruction \u2022 chronic constipation \u2022 hemorrhoids (a mass of dilated veins in swollen tissue around the anus) \u2022 hernia (a protrusion of an organ through a tear in the muscle wall) \u2022 spastic colitis ( irritable bowel syndrome , a condition characterized by alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation) \u2022 laxative dependency GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 905 Constipation",

          "content": "Chalazion A chalazion is an enlargement of a meibomian gland (an oil-producing gland in the eyelid), usually not associ- ated with an infectious agent. More likely, the gland opening is clogged. Initially, a chalazion may resemble a stye, but it usually grows larger. A chalazion may also be located in the middle of the lid and be internal. Blepharitis Blepharitis is the inflammation of the eyelid mar- gins, often with scales and crust. It can lead to eyelash loss, chalazia, styes, ectropion, corneal damage, exces- sive tearing, and chronic conjunctivitis. Entropion Entropion is a condition where the eyelid margin (usually the lower one) is turned inward; the eyelashes touch the eye and irritate the cornea. Ectropion Ectropion is a condition where one or both eyelid margins turn outward, exposing both the conjunctiva that covers the eye and the conjunctiva that lines the eyelid. Eyelid edema Eyelid edema is a condition where the eyelids con- tain excessive fluid. Eyelid tumors Eyelids are susceptible to the same skin tumors as the skin over the rest of the body, including noncancer- ous tumors and cancerous tumors (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma , and sebaceous gland carcinoma). Eyelid muscles are suscep- tible to sarcoma. Causes and symptoms Stye Styes are usually caused by bacterial staphylococcal infections. The symptoms are pain and inflammation in one or more localized regions near the eyelid margin. Chalazion A chalazion is caused by a blockage in the outflow duct of a meibomian gland. Symptoms are inflammation and swelling in the form of a round lump in the lid that may be painful. Blepharitis Some cases of blepharitis are caused by bacterial infection and some by head lice, but in some cases, the cause is unclear. It may also be caused by an overproduc- tion of oil by the meibomian glands. Blepharitis can be a chronic condition that begins in early childhood and can last throughout life. Symptoms can include itching, burn- ing, a feeling that something is in the eye, inflammation, and scales or matted, hard crusts surrounding the eyelashes. Entropion Entropion usually results from aging, but sometimes can be due to a congenital defect, a spastic eyelid muscle, or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be from surgery, injury, or disease. It is accompanied by exces- sive tearing, redness, and discomfort. Ectropion Similar to entropion, the usual cause of ectropion is aging. It also can be due to a spastic eyelid muscle or a scar, as in entropion. It also can be the result of allergies. Symptoms are excessive tearing and hardening of the eyelid conjunctiva. Eyelid edema Eyelid edema is most often caused by allergic reac- tions, for example, allergies to eye makeup, eyedrops or other drugs, or plant allergens such as pollen. Trichinosis, a disease caused by eating undercooked meat, also causes eyelid edema. However, swelling can also be caused by more serious causes, such as infection, and can lead to orbital cellulitis which can threaten vision. Symptoms can include swelling, itching, redness, or pain. Eyelid tumors Tumors found on the eyelids are caused by the same conditions that cause these tumors elsewhere on the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1271 Eyelid disorders A chalazion on the eyelid.This condition is caused by an obstruction of one of the meibomian glands which lubricate the edge of the eyelid.

Surgical procedures include: arterial switch, balloon atrial septostomy, balloon valvulo- plasty, Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, Fontan proce- dure, pulmonary artery banding, Ross procedure, shunt procedure, and venous switch or intra-atrial baffle. Arterial switch, to correct transposition of the great arteries, involves connecting the aorta to the left ventricle and connecting the pulmonary artery to the right ventri- cle. Balloon atrial septostomy, also done to correct trans- position of the great arteries, enlarges the atrial opening during heart catheterization. Balloon valvuloplasty uses a balloon-tipped catheter to open a narrowed heart valve, improving the flow of blood in pulmonary stenosis. It is sometimes used in aortic stenosis. Transposition of the great arteries can also be corrected by the Damus-Kaye- Stansel procedure, in which the pulmonary artery is cut in two and connected to the ascending aorta and the far- thest section of the right ventricle. For tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia, the Fontan procedure connects the right atrium to the pul- monary artery directly or with a conduit, and the atrial defect is closed. Pulmonary artery banding, narrowing the pulmonary artery with a band to reduce blood flow and pressure in the lungs, is used for ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal defect, and tricuspid atresia. Later, the band can be removed and the defect corrected with open-heart surgery. To correct aortic stenosis, the Ross procedure grafts the pulmonary artery to the aorta. For tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, or pulmonary atresia, the shunt proce- dure creates a passage between blood vessels, sending blood into parts of the body that need it. For transposi- tion of the great arteries, venous switch creates a tunnel inside the atria to re-direct oxygen-rich blood to the right ventricle and aorta and venous blood to the left ventricle and pulmonary artery. When all other options fail, some patients may need a heart transplant. Children with congenital heart disease require lifelong monitoring, even after successful surgery. The American Heart Association recommends regular dental check-ups and the preventive use of antibiotics to protect patients from heart infections, or endocarditis . Since children with congenital heart dis- ease have slower growth, nutrition is important. Physi- cians may also limit their athletic activity. Prognosis The outlook for children with congenital heart dis- ease has improved markedly in the past two decades. Many types of congenital heart disease that would have been fatal can now be treated successfully. Research on diagnosing heart defects when the fetus is in the womb may lead to future treatment to correct defects before birth. Promising new prevention methods and treatments include genetic screening and the cultivation of cardiac tissue in the laboratory that could be used to repair con- genital heart defects.

          "content": "the disease may be more common among adults than pre- viously thought. Causes and symptoms The first sign of cat-scratch disease may be a small blister at the site of a scratch or bite three to 10 days after injury. The blister (which sometimes contains pus) often looks like an insect bite and is usually found on the hands, arms, or head. Within two weeks of the blister\u2019s appear- ance, lymph nodes near the site of injury become swollen. Often the infected person develops a fever or experiences fatigue or headaches. The symptoms usually disappear within a month, although the lymph nodes may remain swollen for several months. Hepatitis, pneumonia, and other dangerous complications can arise, but the likelihood of cat-scratch disease posing a serious threat to health is very small. AIDS patients and other immunocompromised people face the greatest risk of dangerous complications. Occasionally, the symptoms of cat-scratch disease take the form of what is called Parinaud\u2019s oculoglandular syn- drome. In such cases, a small sore develops on the palpe- bral conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inner eyelid), and is often accompanied by conjunctivitis(inflammation of the membrane) and swollen lymph nodes in front of the ear. Researchers suspect that the first step in the develop- KEY TERMS Acetaminophen \u2014A drug for relieving pain and fever. AIDS\u2014Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Rubbing one\u2019s eyes after handling the cat then transmits the bacteria to the conjunctiva. Diagnosis A family doctor should be called whenever a cat scratch or bite fails to heal normally or is followed by a persistent fever or other unusual symptoms such as long- lasting bone or joint pain. The appearance of painful and swollen lymph nodes is another reason for consulting a doctor. When cat-scratch disease is suspected, the doctor will ask about a history of exposure to cats and look for evidence of a cat scratch or bite and swollen lymph nodes. A blood test for Bartonella henselae may be ordered to confirm the doctor\u2019s diagnosis. Treatment For otherwise healthy people, rest and over-the- counter medications for reducing fever and discomfort (such as acetaminophen ) while waiting for the disease to run its course are usually all that is necessary. Antibi- otics are prescribed in some cases, particularly when complications occur or the lymph nodes remain swollen and painful for more than two or three months, but there is no agreement among doctors about when and how they should be used. If a lymph node becomes very swollen and painful, the family doctor may decide to drain it. Prognosis Most people recover completely from a bout of cat- scratch disease. Further attacks are rare. Prevention Certain common-sense precautions can be taken to guard against the disease. Scratches and bites should be washed immediately with soap and water, and it is never a good idea to rub one\u2019s eyes after handling a cat without first washing one\u2019s hands. Children should be told not to play with stray cats or make cats angry. Immunocompro- mised people should avoid owning kittens, which are more likely than adult cats to be infectious. Because cat- scratch disease is usually not a life-threatening illness and people tend to form strong emotional bonds with their cats, doctors do not recommend getting rid of a cat suspected of carrying the disease.

          "content": "cysteine (Mucomyst) has been used as a mucolytic for many years but is not prescribe frequently now, while DNase (Pulmozyme) is a newer product gaining in popu- larity. DNase breaks down the DNA from dead white blood cells and bacteria found in thick mucus. People with CF may pick up bacteria from other CF patients. This is especially true of Burkholderia cepacia, which is not usually found in people without CF. While the ideal recommendation from a health standpoint might be to avoid contact with others who have CF, this is not usually practical (since CF clinics are a major site of care), nor does it meet the psychological and social needs of many people with CF. At a minimum, CF centers recom- mend avoiding prolonged close contact between people with CF, and scrupulous hygiene, including frequent hand washing. Some CF clinics schedule appointments on dif- ferent days for those with and without B. cepaciacolonies. Some doctors choose to prescribe antibiotics only dur- ing infection, while others prefer long-term antibiotic treat- ment against S. aureus. The choice of antibiotic depends on the particular organism or organisms found. Some antibi- otics are given as aerosols directly into the lungs. Antibiotic treatment may be prolonged and aggressive. Supplemental oxygen may be needed as lung dis- ease progresses. Respiratory failure may develop, requiring temporary use of a ventilator to perform the work of breathing. Lung transplantation has become increasingly common for people with CF, although the number of people who receive them is still much lower than those who want them. Transplantation is not a cure, however, and has been likened to trading one disease for another. Long-term immunosuppression is required, increasing the likelihood of other types of infection. About 50% of adults and more than 80% of children who receive lung transplants live longer than two years. Liver transplants are also done for CF patients whose livers have been damaged by fibrosis. Long-term use of ibuprofen has been shown to help some people with CF, presumably by reducing inflam- mation in the lungs. Close medical supervision is neces- sary, however, since the effective dose is high and not everyone benefits. Ibuprofen at the required doses inter- feres with kidney function, and together with aminogly- coside antibiotics, may cause kidney failure. A number of experimental treatments are currently the subject of much research. Some evidence indicates that aminoglycoside antibiotics may help overcome the genetic defect in some CF mutations, allowing the pro- tein to be made normally. While promising, these results would apply to only about 5% of those with CF. Gene therapy is currently the most ambitious approach to curing CF. In this set of techniques, non- defective copies of the CFTR gene are delivered to affected cells, where they are taken up and used to create the CFTR protein. While elegant and simple in theory, gene therapy has met with a large number of difficulties in trials so far, including immune resistance, very short duration of the introduced gene, and inadequately wide- spread delivery. Alternative treatment In homeopathic medicine, the symptoms of the disease would be addressed to enhance the quality of life for the person with cystic fibrosis. Treating the cause of CF, because of the genetic basis for the disease, is not possible. Homeopathic medicine seeks to treat the whole person, however, and in CF, this approach might include: \u2022 mucolytics to help thin mucous \u2022 supplementation of pancreatic enzymes to assist in digestion \u2022 respiratory symptoms can be addressed to open lung passages \u2022 hydrotherapy techniques to help ease the respiratory symptoms and help the body eliminate \u2022 immune enhancements can help revent the develop- ment of secondary infections \u2022 dietary enhancements and adjustments are used to treat digestive and nutritional problems Prognosis People with CF may lead relatively normal lives with the control of symptoms. The possible effect of pregnancy on the health of a woman with CF requires careful consid- eration before beginning a family as do issues of longevi- ty and their children\u2019s status as carriers. Although most men with CF are functionally sterile, new procedures for removing sperm from the testes are being tried, and may offer more men the chance to become fathers. Approximately half of people with CF live past the age of 30. Because of better and earlier treatment, a per- son born today with CF is expected, on average, to live to age 40. Prevention Adults with a family history of cystic fibrosis may obtain a genetic test of their carrier status for purposes of family planning. Prenatal testing is also available. There is currently no known way to prevent development of CF in a person with two defective gene copies. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 989 Cystic fibrosis",

Other medications that have been tested or are being tested for treatment of CFS are: \u2022 Fludrocortisone (Florinef), a synthetic steroid, which is currently being tested for treatment of people with CFS. It causes the body to retain salt, thereby increas- ing blood pressure. It has helped some people with CFS who have neurally mediated hypotension. \u2022 Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, often prescribed for high blood pressure. Such drugs, including atenolol (Tenoretic, Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal), are sometimes pre- scribed for neurally mediated hypotension. \u2022 Gamma globulin, which contains human antibodies to a variety of organisms that cause infection. It has been used experimentally to boost immune function in peo- ple with CFS. \u2022 Ampligen, a drug which stimulates the immune system and has antiviral activity. In one small study, ampligen improved mental function in people with CFS. Alternative treatment A variety of nutritional supplements are used for treatment of CFS. Among these are vitamin C, vitamin B12, vitamin A, vitamin E, and various dietary minerals. These supplements may help improve immune and men- tal functions. Several herbs have been shown to improve immune function and have other beneficial effects. Some that are used for CFS are astragalus ( Astragalus mem- branaceus), echinacea (Echinacea spp.), garlic ( Allium sativum), ginseng (Panax ginseng), gingko (Gingko bilo- ba), evening primrose oil ( Oenothera biennis ), shiitake mushroom extract ( Lentinus edodes ), borage seed oil, and quercetin. Many people have enhanced their healing process for CFS with the use of a treatment program inclusive of one or more alternative therapies. Stress reduction tech- niques such as biofeedback, meditation, acupuncture, and yoga may help people with sleep disturbances relax and get more rest. They also help some people reduce depression and anxiety caused by CFS. Prognosis The course of CFS varies widely for different peo- ple. Some people get progressively worse over time, while others gradually improve. Some individuals have periods of illness that alternate with periods of good health. While many people with CFS never fully regain their health, they find relief from symptoms and adapt to the demands of the disorder by carefully following a treatment plan combining adequate rest, nutrition,e x e r - cise, and other therapies.

          "content": "Alternative treatment Initially, alternative practitioners will suggest that the patient drink an adequate amount of water each day (six to eight glasses), exercise on a regular basis, and eat a diet high in soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers include pectin, flax, and gums; insoluble fibers include psyllium and brans from grains like wheat and oats. Fresh fruits and vegetables contain both soluble and insoluble fibers. Castor oil, applied topically to the abdomen and covered by a heat source (a heating pad or hot water bottle), can help relieve constipation when used nightly for 20\u201330 minutes. Acupressure This needleless form of acupuncture is said to relax the abdomen, ease discomfort, and stimulate regular bowel movements when diet and exercise fail to do so. After lying down, the patient closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. For two minutes, he applies gentle fingertip pressure to a point about two and one-half inches below the navel. Accupressure can also be applied to the outer edges of one elbow crease and maintained for 30 seconds before pressing the crease of the other elbow. This should be done three times a day to relieve constipation. Aromatherapy Six drops of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) and six drops of thyme ( Thymus spp.) diluted by 1 oz of almond oil, olive oil, or another carrier oil can relieve constipation when used to massage the abdomen. Herbal therapy A variety of herbal therapies can be useful in the treatment of constipation. Several herbs, including chamomile (Matricaria recutita), dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum ), and burdock ( Arctium lappa ), act as bit- ters, stimulating the movement of the digestive and excretory systems. There are also \u201claxative\u201d herbs that assist with bowel movement. Two of these are senna (Cassia senna ) and buckthorn ( Rhamnus purshiana ). These \u201claxative\u201d herbs are stronger acting on elimination than bitters and can sometimes cause cramping (mixing them with a calming herb like fennel or caraway can help reduce cramping). Both senna and buckthorn are power- ful herbs that are best used with direction from an experi- enced practitioner, since they can have adverse side effects and the patient may become dependent on them. Homeopathy Homeopathy also can offer assistance with consti- pation. There are acute remedies for constipation that can be found in one of the many home remedy books on homeopathic medicine. A constitutional prescription also can help rebalance someone who is struggling with con- stipation. Massage Massaging the leg from knee to hip in the morning, at night, and before trying to move the bowels is said to relieve constipation. There is also a specific Swedish massage technique that can help relieve constipation. Yoga The knee-chest position, said to relieve gas and stim- ulate abdominal organs, involves: \u2022 standing straight with arms at the sides \u2022 lifting the right knee toward the chest \u2022 grasping the right ankle with the left hand \u2022 pulling the leg as close to the chest as possible \u2022 holding the position for about eight seconds \u2022 repeating these steps with the left leg The cobra position, which can be repeated as many as four time a day, involves: \u2022 lying on the stomach with legs together \u2022 placing the palms just below the shoulders, holding elbows close to the body \u2022 inhaling, then lifting the head (face forward) and chest off the floor GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 907 Constipation Transverse colon Descending colon Stool Sigmoid colon Rectum Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in which bowel movements occur less often than usual or consist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to pass.

When treat- ed with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure, many patients in the study had marked improvements in their CFS symptoms. Diagnosis CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim- inating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques- tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses they have had, and medications they are taking. They also conduct a physical examination , neurological examination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly- ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the United States, many doctors use the CDC case definition to determine if a patient has CFS. To be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both of the following criteria: \u2022 Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for at least six months that is of new or definite onset, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly relieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational, social, or personal activities to be greatly reduced. \u2022 Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short- term memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following exercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more than 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must not have started before the fatigue began. Treatment There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual- ly are individualized to each person\u2019s particular symp- toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom- mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced diet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and resting when needed are key to maintaining existing energy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to keep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too much exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp- toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also may help some people with CFS. Many medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal preparations have been used to treat CFS. While many of these are unproven, others seem to provide some people with relief. People with CFS should discuss their treatment KEY TERMS Arthralgia\u2014Joint pain.

          "content": "underlying inflammatory process involved in fibromyal- gia has helped promote the validity of this disease. In 1990, the America College of Rheumatology developed standards for fibromyalgia that health care practitioners can use to diagnose this condition. Accord- ing to these standards, a person is thought to have fibromyalgia if he or she has widespread pain in combi- nation with tenderness in at least 11 of the 18 sites known as trigger points. Trigger point sites include the base of the neck, along the backbone, in front of the hip and elbow, and at the rear of the knee and shoulder. Treatment There is no known cure for fibromyalgia. Therefore, the goal of treatment is successful symptom manage- ment. Treatment usually requires a combination of thera- pies, exercise , proper rest, and diet. A patient\u2019s clear understanding of his or her role in the recovery process is imperative for successful management of this condition. Treatments found to be helpful include heat and occa- sionally cold applications. A regular stretching program is often useful. Aerobic activities focusing on increasing the heart rate are the preferred forms of exercise over most other forms of exertion. Exercise programs need to include good warm-up and cool-down sessions, with special atten- tion given to avoiding exercises causing joint pain. The diet should include a large variety of fruits and vegetables which provide the body with trace elements and minerals that are necessary for healthy muscles. Adequate rest is essential in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Avoidance of stimulating foods or drinks (such as coffee) and medications like decongestants prior to bedtime is advised. If diet, exercise, and ade- quate rest do not relieve the symptoms of fibromyalgia, medications may be prescribed. Medications prescribed and found to have some benefit include antidepressant drugs, muscle relaxants, and anti-inflammatory drugs. People with fibromyalgia often need a rheumatology consultation (a meeting with a doctor who specializes in disorders of the joints, muscles, and soft tissue) to decide the cause of various rheumatic symptoms, to be educated about fibromyalgia and its treatment, and to exclude other rheumatic diseases. A treatment program must be individ- ualized to meet the patient\u2019s needs. The rheumatologist, as the team leader, enlists and coordinates the expertise of other health professionals in the care of the patient. Alternative treatment Massage therapy can be helpful, especially when a family member is instructed on specific massage tech- niques to manage episodes of increased symptoms. Spe- KEY TERMS Connective tissue\u2014Tissue that supports and binds other body tissue and parts. Lyme disease \u2014An acute recurrent inflammatory disease involving one or a few joints, believed to be transmitted by a tickborne virus. The condition was originally described in the community of Lyme, Connecticut, but has also been reported in other parts of the United States and other coun- tries. Knees, other large joints are most commonly involved with local inflammation and swelling. Rheumatology\u2014The study of disorders character- ized by inflammation, degeneration of connective tissue, and related structures of the body. These disorders are sometimes collectively referred to as rheumatism. cific attention to mental health, including psychological consultation, may also be important, since depression may precede or accompany fibromyalgia. Other alterna- tive therapies, including hellerwork , rolfing, homeo- pathic medicine, Chinese traditional medicine (both acupuncture and herbs), polarity therapy, and Western botanical medicine, can assist the person with fibromyal- gia to function day to day and can contribute to healing. Prognosis Fibromyalgia is a chronic problem. The symptoms sometimes improve and at other times worsen, but they often continue for months to years. Prevention There is no known or specific way to prevent fibromyalgia. However, similar to many other medical conditions, remaining as healthy as possible with a good diet, safe exercise, and adequate rest is the best prevention. Resources BOOKS Schumacher, H. R.

          "content": "Genes from a small blood or tissue sample are analyzed for specific mutations; presence of two copies of the mutated gene confirms the diagnosis of CF in all but a very few cases. However, since there are so many differ- ent possible mutations, and since testing for all of them would be too expensive and time-consuming, a negative gene test cannot rule out the possibility of CF. Couples planning a family may decide to have them- selves tested if one or both have a family history of CF. Prenatal genetic testing is possible through amniocente- sis. Many couples who already have one child with CF decide to undergo prenatal screening in subsequent preg- nancies, and use the results to determine whether to ter- minate the pregnancy. Siblings in these families are also usually tested, both to determine if they will develop CF, and to determine if they are carriers, to aid in their own family planning. If the sibling has no symptoms, deter- mining his carrier status is often delayed until his teen years or later, when he is closer to needing the informa- tion to make decisions. Newborn screening Some states now require screening of newborns for CF, using a test known as the IRT test. This is a blood test which measures the level of immunoreactive trypsino- gen, which is generally higher in babies with CF than those without it. This test gives many false positive results immediately after birth, and so requires a second test several weeks later. A second positive result is usual- ly followed by a sweat test. Treatment There is no cure for CF. Treatment has advanced con- siderably in the past several decades, increasing both the life span and the quality of life for most people affected by CF. Early diagnosis is important to prevent malnutri- tion and infection from weakening the young child. With proper management, many people with CF engage in the full range of school and sports activities. Nutrition People with CF usually require high-calorie diets and vitamin supplements. Height, weight, and growth of a person with CF are monitored regularly. Most people with CF need to take pancreatic enzymes to supplement or replace the inadequate secretions of the pancreas. Tablets containing pancreatic enzymes are taken with every meal; depending on the size of the tablet and the meal, as many as 20 tablets may be needed. Because of incomplete absorption even with pancreatic enzymes, a person with CF needs to take in about 30% more food than a person without CF. Low-fat diets are not recom- mended except in special circumstances, since fat is a source of both essential fatty acids and abundant calories. Some people with CF cannot absorb enough nutri- ents from the foods they eat, even with specialized diets and enzymes. For these people, tube feeding is an option. Nutrients can be introduced directly into the stomach through a tube inserted either through the nose (a naso- gastric tube) or through the abdominal wall (a gastrosto- my tube). A jejunostomy tube, inserted into the small intestine, is also an option. Tube feeding can provide nutrition at any time, including at night while the person is sleeping, allowing constant intake of high-quality nutrients. The feeding tube may be removed during the day, allowing normal meals to be taken. Respiratory health The key to maintaining respiratory health in a person with CF is regular monitoring and early treatment. Lung function tests are done frequently to track changes in functional lung volume and respiratory effort. Sputum samples are analyzed to determine the types of bacteria present in the lungs. Chest x rays are usually taken at least once a year. Lung scans, using a radioactive gas, can show closed off areas not seen on the x ray. Circula- tion in the lungs may be monitored by injection of a radioactive substance into the bloodstream. People with CF live with chronic bacterial coloniza- tion; that is, their lungs are constantly host to several species of bacteria. Good general health, especially good nutrition, can keep the immune system healthy, which decreases the frequency with which these colonies begin an infection, or attack on the lung tissue. Exercise is anoth- er important way to maintain health, and people with CF are encouraged to maintain a program of regular exercise. In addition, clearing mucus from the lungs helps to prevent infection; and mucus control is an important aspect of CF management. Postural drainage is used to allow gravity to aid the mucociliary escalator. For this technique, the person with CF lies on a tilted surface with head downward, alternately on the stomach, back, or side, depending on the section of lung to be drained. An assis- tant thumps the rib cage to help loosen the secretions. A device called a \u201cflutter\u201d offers another way to loosen secretions: it consists of a stainless steel ball in a tube. When a person exhales through it, the ball vibrates, send- ing vibrations back through the air in the lungs. Some spe- cial breathing techniques may also help clear the lungs. Several drugs are available to prevent the airways from becoming clogged with mucus. Bronchodilators and theophyllines open up the airways; steroids reduce inflammation; and mucolytics loosen secretions. Acetyl- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 988 Cystic fibrosis",

          "content": "Each person actually has two copies of each gene, including the CFTR gene, in each of their body cells. Dur- ing sperm and egg production, however, these two copies separate, so that each sperm or egg contains only one copy of each gene. When sperm and egg unite, the newly creat- ed cell once again has two copies of each gene. The two gene copies may be the same or they may be slightly different. For the CFTR gene, for instance, a person may have two normal copies, or one normal and one mutated copy, or two mutated copies. A person with two mutated copies will develop cystic fibrosis. A person with one mutated copy is said to be a carrier. A carrier will not have symptoms of CF, but can pass on the mutat- ed CFTR gene to his/her children. When two carriers have children, they have a one in four chance of having a child with CF each time they conceive. They have a two in four chance of having a child who is a carrier, and a one in four chance of having a child with two normal CFTR genes. Approximately one in every 25 Americans of north- ern-European descent is a carrier of the mutated CF gene, while only one in 17,000 African Americans and one in 30,000 Asian Americans are carriers. Since carri- ers are symptom-free, very few people will know whether or not they are carriers unless there is a family history of the disease. Two white Americans with no family history of CF have a one in 2,500 chance of hav- ing a child with CF. It may seem puzzling that a mutated gene with such harmful consequences would remain so common; one might guess that the high mortality of CF would quickly lead to loss of the mutated gene from the population. Some researchers now believe the reason for the persis- tence of the CF gene is that carriers, those with only one copy of the gene, are protected from the full effects of cholera, a microorganism that infects the intestine, caus- ing intense diarrhea and eventual death by dehydra- tion. It is believed that having one copy of the CF gene is enough to prevent the full effects of cholera infection, while not enough to cause the symptoms of CF. This so- called \u201cheterozygote advantage\u201d is seen in some other genetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia. Symptoms The most severe effects of cystic fibrosis are seen in two body systems: the gastrointestinal (digestive) sys- tem, and the respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs. CF also affects the sweat glands and male fertility. Symptoms develop gradually, with gastrointestinal symptoms often the first to appear. GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 985 Cystic fibrosis DOROTHY ANDERSEN, MD (1901\u20131963) Dorothy Andersen was born on May 15, 1901, in Asheville, North Carolina. She was the only child of Hans Peter Andersen and the former Mary Louise Mason. Orphaned as a young adult, Andersen put herself through Saint Johnsbury Academy and Mount Holyoke College before enrolling in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, from which she received her M.D. in 1926. Andersen turned instead to medical research as a pathologist at Babies Hospital of the Columbia-Presbyter- ian Medical Center in New York City, where she stayed for more than 20 years, eventually becoming chief of patholo- gy in 1952. Andersen is probably best known for discovery of cystic fibrosis in 1935. That discovery came about during the postmortem examination of a child who had supposed- ly died of celiac disease, a nutritional disorder. She searched for similar cases in the autopsy files and in med- ical literature, eventually realizing that she had found a dis- ease that had never been described and to which she gave the name cystic fibrosis.

Lohr, PhD Cystic fibrosis Definition Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects the lungs, digestive system, sweat glands, and male fertility. Its name derives from the fibrous scar tis- sue that develops in the pancreas, one of the principal organs affected by the disease. Description Cystic fibrosis affects the body\u2019s ability to move salt and water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungs and pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage- ways and preventing proper function. CF affects approximately 30,000 children and young adults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies are born with CF every year. CF primarily affects people of white northern-European descent; rates are much lower in non-white populations. Many of the symptoms of CF can be treated with drugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to and prompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica- tions have dramatically increased the expected life span of a person with CF. While several decades ago most children with CF died by age two, today about half of all people with CF live past age 31. That median age is expected to grow as new treatments are developed, and it is estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has a median expected life span of 40 years. Causes and symptoms Causes Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease, meaning it is caused by a defect in the person\u2019s genes. Genes, found in the nucleus of all the body\u2019s cells, control cell function by serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins. Proteins carry out a wide variety of functions within cells. The gene that, when defective, causes CF, is called the CFTR gene, which stands for cystic fibrosis trans- membrane conductance regulator. A simple defect in this gene leads to all the consequences of CF. There are over 500 known defects in the CFTR gene that can cause CF. However, 70% of all people with a defective CFTR gene have the same defect, known as delta-F508. Much as sentences are composed of long strings of words, each made of letters; genes can be thought of as long strings of chemical words, each made of chemical letters, called nucleotides. Just as a sentence can be changed by rearranging its letters, genes can be mutated, or changed, by changes in the sequence of their nucleotide letters. The gene defects in CF are called point mutations, meaning that the gene is mutated only at one small spot along its length. In other words, the delta- F508 mutation is a loss of one \u201cletter\u201d out of thousands within the CFTR gene. As a result, the CFTR protein made from its blueprint is made incorrectly, and cannot perform its function properly. The CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is a complex mixture of salts, water, sugars, and proteins that cleanses, lubricates, and protects many passageways in the body, including those in the lungs and pancreas. The role of the CFTR protein is to allow chloride ions to exit the mucus-producing cells. When the chloride ions leave these cells, water follows, thinning the mucus. In this way, the CFTR protein helps to keep mucus from becoming thick and sluggish, thus allowing the mucus to be moved steadi- ly along the passageways to aid in cleansing. In CF, the CFTR protein cannot allow chloride ions out of the mucus-producing cells. With less chloride leaving, less water leaves, and the mucus becomes thick and sticky. It can no longer move freely through the pas- sageways, so they become clogged. In the pancreas, clogged passageways prevent secretion of digestive enzymes into the intestine, causing serious impairment of digestion\u2014especially of fat\u2014which may lead to mal- nutrition. Mucus in the lungs may plug the airways, pre- venting good air exchange and, ultimately, leading to emphysema. The mucus is also a rich source of nutrients for bacteria, leading to frequent infections. INHERITANCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. To understand the inheritance pattern of CF, it is important to realize that genes actually have two functions. First, as noted above, they serve as the blueprint for the production of proteins. Second, they are the material of inheritance: parents pass on characteristics to their children by combining the genes in egg and sperm to make a new individual.

          "content": "Meconium is the first dark stool that a baby passes after birth; ileus is an obstruction of the digestive tract. The meconium of a newborn with meconium ileus is thick- ened and sticky, due to the presence of thickened mucus from the intestinal glands. Meconium ileus causes abdominal swelling and vomiting, and often requires surgery immediately after birth. Presence of meconium ileus is considered highly indicative of CF. Borderline cases may be misdiagnosed, however, and attributed instead to \u201cmilk allergy.\u201d Other abdominal symptoms are caused by the inabil- ity of the pancreas to supply digestive enzymes to the intestine. During normal digestion, as food passes from the stomach into the small intestine, it is mixed with pan- creatic secretions which help to break down the nutrients for absorption. While the intestines themselves also pro- vide some digestive enzymes, the pancreas is the major source of enzymes for the digestion of all types of foods, especially fats and proteins. In CF, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct, which is eventually closed off completely by scar tissue formation, leading to a condition known as pancreatic insufficiency. Without pancreatic enzymes, large amounts of undigested food pass into the large intes- tine. Bacterial action on this rich food source can cause gas and abdominal swelling. The large amount of fat remaining in the feces makes it bulky, oily, and foul- smelling. Because nutrients are only poorly digested and absorbed, the person with CF is often ravenously hungry, underweight, and shorter than expected for his age. When CF is not treated for a longer period, a child may develop symptoms of malnutrition, including anemia, bloating, and, paradoxically, appetite loss. Diabetes becomes increasingly likely as a person with CF ages. Scarring of the pancreas slowly destroys those pancreatic cells which produce insulin, producing type I, or insulin-dependent diabetes. Gall stones affect approximately 10% of adults with CF. Liver problems are less common, but can be caused by the buildup of fat within the liver. Complications of liver enlargement may include internal hemorrhaging, abdomi- nal fluid (ascites), spleen enlargement, and liver failure. Other gastrointestinal symptoms can include a pro- lapsed rectum, in which part of the rectal lining protrudes through the anus; intestinal obstruction; and rarely, intussusception, in which part of the intestinal tube slips over an adjoining part, cutting off blood supply. Somewhat less than 10% of people with CF do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. Most of these people do not have the delta-F508 mutation, but rather a different one, which presumably allows at least some of their CFTR proteins to function normally in the pancreas. RESPIRATORY TRACT. The respiratory tract includes the nose, the throat, the trachea (or windpipe), the bronchi (which branch off from the trachea within each lung), the smaller bronchioles, and the blind sacs called alveoli, in which gas exchange takes place between air and blood. Swelling of the sinuses within the nose is common in people with CF. This usually shows up on x-ray, and may aid the diagnosis of CF. However, this swelling, called pansinusitis, rarely causes problems, and does not usually require treatment. Nasal polyps , or growths, affect about one in five people with CF. These growths are not cancerous, and do not require removal unless they become annoying. While nasal polyps appear in older people without CF, especially those with allergies, they are rare in children without CF. The lungs are the site of the most life-threatening effects of CF. The production of a thick, sticky mucus increases the likelihood of infection, decreases the abil- ity to protect against infection, causes inflammation and swelling, decreases the functional capacity of the lungs, and may lead to emphysema. People with CF will live with chronic populations of bacteria in their lungs, and lung infection is the major cause of death for those with CF. The bronchioles and bronchi normally produce a thin, clear mucus that traps foreign particles including bacteria and viruses. Tiny hair-like projections on the surface of these passageways slowly sweep the mucus along, out of the lungs and up the trachea to the back of the throat, where it may be swallowed or coughed up. This \u201cmucociliary escalator\u201d is one of the principal defenses against lung infection. The thickened mucus of CF prevents easy movement out of the lungs, and increases the irritation and inflam- mation of lung tissue. This inflammation swells the pas- sageways, partially closing them down, further hamper- ing the movement of mucus. A person with CF is likely to cough more frequently and more vigorously as the lungs attempt to clean themselves out. At the same time, infection becomes more likely since the mucus is a rich source of nutrients. Bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are frequent in CF. The most common infecting organisms are the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , Haemophilus influenzae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . A small percentage of people with CF have infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia, a bacterium which is resistant to most current antibiotics (Burkholderia cepacia was formerly known as GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 986 Cystic fibrosis",

These include severe infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cirrhosis of the liver. The idiopathic form most com- monly occurs in children, and is most likely the result of production of antibodies that cause destruction of platelets in the spleen and to a lesser extent the liver. V on Willebrand\u2019s disease is caused by a defect in the V on Willebrand clotting factor, often accompanied by a deficiency of Factor VIII as well. It is a hereditary disor- der that affects both males and females. In rare cases, it may be acquired. Symptoms include easy bruising, bleed- ing in small cuts that stops and starts, abnormal bleeding after surgery, and abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding. Nosebleeds and blood in the stool with a black, tarlike appearance are also signs of V on Willebrand\u2019s disease. Hypoprothrombinemia This disorder is a deficiency in prothrombin, or Factor II, a glycoprotein formed and stored in the liver. Prothrom- bin, under the right conditions, is converted to thrombin, which activates fibrin and begins the process of coagula- tion. Some patients may show no symptoms, and others will suffer severe hemorrhaging. Patients may experience easy bruising, profuse nosebleeds, postpartum hemorrhage, excessively prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, and postsurgical hemorrhage. Hypoprothrombinemia may also be acquired rather than inherited, and usually results from a Vitamin K deficiency caused by liver diseases, newborn hemorrhagic disease, or a number of other factors. Other coagulation disorders Factor XI deficiency, or hemophilia C, occurs more frequently among certain ethnic groups, with an incidence of about one in 10,000 among Ashkenazi Jews. Nearly 50% of patients with this disorder experience no symp- toms, but others may notice blood in their urine, nose- bleeds, or bruising. Although joint bleeding seldom occurs, some factor XI patients will experience bleeding long after an injury occurs. Some women will experience prolonged bleeding after childbirth. Patients with factor VII deficien- cy vary greatly in their bleeding severity. Women may experience heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding from the gums or nose, bleeding deep within the skin, and episodes of bleeding into the stomach, intestine, and urinary tract. Factor VII patients may also suffer bleeding into joints. Diagnosis Several blood tests can be used to detect various coagulation disorders. There are hundreds of different tests a doctor can order to look for indications of specific diseases. In addition to blood tests, physicians will com- plete a medical history and physical examination. In the case of acquired coagulation disorders, information such as prior or current diseases and medications will be important in determining the cause of the blood disorder. \u2022 Hemohilia A will be diagnosed with laboratory tests detecting presence of clotting factor VIII, factor IX, and others, as well as the presence or absence of clotting factor inhibitors. \u2022 Christmas disease will be checked against normal bleeding and clotting time, as well as for abnormal serum reagents in factor IX deficiency. Other tests of prothrombin time and thromboplastic generation may also be ordered. \u2022 There is no one test or group of tests that can always make (or exclude) a diagnosis of DIC. DIC can be diag- nosed through a number of laboratory tests which mea- sure concentration of platelets and fibrinogen in the blood with normal counts and prolonged prothrombin time. Other supportive data include diminished levels of factors V , fibrinogen, and VIII, decreased hemoglo- bin, and others. Since many of the test results also indi- cate other disorders, the physician may have to put together several results to reach a diagnosis of DIC. Serial tests may also be recommended, because a single examine at one moment in time may not reveal the process that is occurring. \u2022 Tests for thrombocytopenia include coagulation tests revealing a decreased platelet count, prolonged bleed- ing time, and other measurements. If these tests indi- cate that platelet destruction is causing the disorder, the physician may order bone marrow examination. \u2022 V on Willebrand\u2019s disease will be diagnosed with the assistance of laboratory tests which show prolonged bleeding time, absent or reduced levels of factor VIII, normal platelet count, and others. \u2022 Hypothrombinemia is diagnosed with history informa- tion and the use of tests that measure vitamin K defi- ciency, deficiency of prothrombin, and clotting factors V , VII, IX, and X. \u2022 Factor XI deficiency is diagnosed most often after injury-related bleeding. Blood tests can help pinpoint factor VII deficiency. Treatment In mild cases, treatment may involve the use of drugs that stimulate the release of deficient clotting fac- tors. In severe cases, bleeding may only stop if the clot- ting factor that is missing is replaced through infusion of donated human blood in the form of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.

Secondary encephalitis may occur with measles, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and EBV . In secondary encephalitis, symptoms usually begin five to 10 days after the onset of the disease itself and are related to the break- down of the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers. In rare cases, encephalitis may follow vaccination against some of the viral diseases listed above. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a very rare brain disorder caused by an infectious particle called a prion, may also cause encephalitis. Mosquitoes spread viruses responsible for equine encephalitis (eastern and western types), St. Louis encephalitis, California encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis . Lyme disease, spread by ticks, can cause encephalitis, as can Colorado tick fever. Rabies is most often spread by animal bites from dogs, cats, mice, rac- coons, squirrels, and bats and may cause encephalitis. Equine encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes that do not normally bite humans but do bite horses and birds. It is occasionally picked up from these animals by mosqui- toes that do bite humans. Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis are also carried by mosquitoes. The risk of contracting a mosquito-borne virus is greatest in mid- to late summer, when mosquitoes are most active, in those rural areas where these viruses are known to exist. Eastern equine encephalitis occurs in eastern and southeastern United States; western equine and Califor- nia encephalitis occur throughout the West; and St. Louis encephalitis occurs throughout the country. Japanese encephalitis does not occur in the United States, but is found throughout much of Asia. The viruses responsible for these diseases are classified as arbovirus and these diseases are collectively called arbovirus encephalitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis, the most common form of sporadic encephalitis in western countries, is a disease with significantly high mortality. It occurs in children and adults and both sides of the brain are affected. It is theo- rized that brain infection is caused by the virus moving from a peripheral location to the brain via two nerves, the olfactory and the trigeminal (largest nerves in the skull). Herpes simplex encephalitis is responsible for 10% of all encephalitis cases and is the main cause of spo- radic, fatal encephalitis. In untreated patients, the rate of death is 70% while the mortality is 15\u201320% in patients who have been treated with acyclovir. The symptoms of herpes simplex encephalitis are fever, rapidly disintegrat- ing mental state, headache, and behavioral changes. Symptoms The symptoms of encephalitis range from very mild to very severe and may include: \u2022 headache \u2022f e v e r \u2022 lethargy (sleepiness, decreased alertness, and fatigue) \u2022 malaise \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 visual disturbances \u2022 tremor \u2022 decreased consciousness (drowsiness, confusion, delir- ium, and unconsciousness) \u2022 stiff neck \u2022 seizures Symptoms may progress rapidly, changing from mild to severe within several days or even several hours. Diagnosis Diagnosis of encephalitis includes careful question- ing to determine possible exposure to viral sources. Tests that can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other disorders include: \u2022 Blood tests. These are to detect antibodies to viral anti- gens, and foreign proteins. \u2022 Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (spinal tap). This detects viral antigens, and provides culture specimens for the virus or bacteria that may be present in the cere- brospinal fluid. \u2022 Electroencephalogram (EEG). \u2022 CT and MRI scans. A brain biopsy (surgical gathering of a small tissue sample) may be recommended in some cases where treatment to date has been ineffective and the cause of the encephalitis is unclear. Definite diagnosis by biopsy may allow specific treatment that would otherwise be too risky. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1178 Encephalitis",

Severe bleeding episodes will require transfusions of human blood clot- ting factors. Hemophiliacs are encouraged to receive physical therapy to help damaged joints and to exercise in non-contact sports such as swimming, bicycle riding, or walking. \u2022 Christmas disease patients are treated similarly to hemophilia A patients. There are commercial products and human blood products available to provide coagu- lation. Cryoprecipitate was invented in 1965 to replace the need for whole plasma transfusions, which intro- duced more volume than needed. By the 1970s, people were able to infuse themselves with freeze-dried clot- ting factor. Superficial wounds can be cleaned and ban- daged. Parents of hemophiliac children receiving immunizations should inform the vaccination provider in advance to decrease the possibility of bleeding prob- lems. These children should probably not receive injec- tions which go into the muscle. \u2022 Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation patients is complicated by the large variety of underly- ing causes of the disorder. If at all possible, the physi- cian will first treat this underlying disorder. If the patient is not already bleeding, this supportive treat- ment may eliminate the DIC. However, if bleeding is occurring, the patient may need blood, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, or other blood products. Heparin has been controversial in treating DIC, but it is often used as a last resort to stop hemorrhage. Heparin has not proven useful in treating patients with DIC resulting from heat stroke, exotic snakebites, trauma, mis- matched transfusions, and acute problems resulting from obstetrical complications. \u2022 Secondary acquired thrombocytopenia is best alleviated by treating the underlying cause or disorder. The specif- ic treatment may depend on the underlying cause. Sometimes, cortocoosterids or immune globulin may be given to improve platelet production. \u2022 V on Willebrand\u2019s disease is treated by several methods to reduce bleeding time and to replace factor VIII, which consequently will replace the V on Willebrand factor. This may include infusion of cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma. Desmopressin may also help raise levels of the V on Willebrand factor. \u2022 Hypoprothrombinemia may be treated with concen- trates of prothrombin. Vitamin K may also be produced, and in bleeding episodes, the patient may receive fresh plasma products. \u2022 Factor XI (hemophilia C) is most often treated with plasma, since there are no commercially available con- centrates of factor XI in the United States. Factor VII patients may be treated with prothrombin complex con- centrates. As of early 1998, factor VII concentrate was not licensed in the United States and could only be used with special permission. Alternative treatment This can be a very severe condition and should be managed by a practitioner of alternative medicine in con- junction with a medical doctor; this condition should not be self managed. For patients known to suffer from hemo- philia A or B and other bleeding disorders, avoidance of activities that can cause severe injury should be practiced. Comprehensive care addresses the whole person by help- ing to deal with the psychosocial aspects of the disease. Prognosis The prognosis for patients with mild forms of coag- ulation disorders is normally good. Many people can lead a normal life and maintain a normal life expectancy. Without treatment of bleeding episodes, severe muscle and joint pain, and eventually, damage, can occur. Any incident that causes blood to collect in the head, neck, or digestive system can be very serious and requires imme- diate attention. DIC can be severe enough to cause clots to form and a stroke could occur. DIC is also serious enough to cause gangrene in the fingers, nose, or geni- tals. The prognosis depends on early intervention and treatment of the underlying condition. Hemorrhage from a coagulation disorder, particularly into the brain or digestive track, can prove fatal. In the past, patients who received regular transfusions of human blood products were subject to increased risk of AIDS and other dis- eases. However, efforts have been made since the early 1990s to ensure the safety of the blood supply. Prevention Prevention of coagulation disorders varies. Acquired disorders may only be prevented by preventing onset of the underlying disorder (such as cirrhosis). Hereditary disor- ders can be predicted with prenatal testing and genetic counseling. Prevention of severe bleeding episodes may be accomplished by refraining from activities that could cause injury, such as contact sports. Open communication with healthcare providers prior to procedures or tests that could cause bleeding may prevent a severe bleeding incident. Resources BOOKS Bellenir, Karen.

The most com- monly known coagulation disorder is hemophilia, a con- dition in which patients bleed for long periods of time before clotting. There are other coagulation disorders with a variety of causes. Description Coagulation, or clotting, occurs as a complex process involving several components of the blood. Plas- ma, the fluid component of the blood, carries a number of proteins and coagulation factors that regulate bleed- ing. Platelets, small colorless fragments in the blood, ini- tiate contraction of damaged blood vessels so that less blood is lost. They also help plug damaged blood vessels and work with plasma to accelerate blood clotting. A dis- order affecting platelet production or one of the many steps in the entire process can disrupt clotting. Coagulation disorders arise from different causes and produce different complications. Some common coagulation disorders are: \u2022 Hemophilia, or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), an inherited coagulation disorder, affects about 20,000 Americans. This genetic disorder is carried by females but most often affects males. \u2022 Christmas disease, also known as hemophilia B or Fac- tor IX deficiency, is less common than hemophilia A with similar in symptoms. \u2022 Disseminated intravascular coagulation disorder, also known as consumption coagulopathy, occurs as a result of other diseases and conditions. This disease acceler- ates clotting, which can actually cause hemorrhage. \u2022 Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of coagulation disorder. It is characterized by a lack of cir- culating platelets in the blood. This disease also includes idiopathic thrombocytopenia. \u2022 V on Willebrand\u2019s disease is a hereditary disorder with prolonged bleeding time due to a clotting factor defi- ciency and impaired platelet function. It is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder. \u2022 Hypoprothrombinemia is a congenital deficiency of clotting factors that can lead to hemorrhage. \u2022 Other coagulation disorders include Factor XI deficien- cy, also known as hemophilia C, and Factor VII defi- ciency. Hemophilia C afflicts one in 100,000 people and is the second most common bleeding disorder among women. Factor VII is also called serum pro- thrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA) deficiency. One in 500,000 people may be afflicted with this disor- der that is often diagnosed in newborns because of bleeding into the brain as a result of traumatic delivery. Causes and symptoms Some coagulation disorders present symptoms such as severe bruising. Others will show no apparent symp- toms, but carry the threat of severe internal bleeding. Hemophilia Because of its hereditary nature, hemophilia A may be suspected before symptoms occur. Some signs of hemophilia A are numerous large, deep bruises and pain and swelling of joints caused by internal bleeding. Patients with hemophilia do not bleed faster, just longer. A person with mild hemophilia may first discover the disorder with prolonged bleeding following a surgical procedure.

Narcotics Short-acting narcotics can ease pain and don\u2019t inter- fere with a woman\u2019s ability to push. However, they can cause sedation, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Narcotics cross the placenta and may slow down a baby\u2019s breathing; they can\u2019t be given too close to the time of delivery. Natural childbirth and preparation for childbirth There are several methods to prepare for childbirth. The one selected often depends on what is available through the healthcare provider. Overall, family involve- ment is receiving increased attention by the healthcare systems, and many hospitals now offer birthing rooms and maternity centers to help the entire family. There are several choices available for childbirth preparation. Lamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common in the United States today. It was the first popular natural childbirth method, becoming popular in the 1960s. Breathing exercises and concentration on a focal point are practiced to allow mothers to control pain while maintaining consciousness. This allows the flow of oxy- gen to the baby and to the muscles in the uterus to be maintained. A partner coaches the mother throughout the birthing process. The Read method, named for Dick Read, is a tech- nique of breathing that was originated in the 1930s to help mothers deal with apprehension and tension associ- ated with childbirth. This natural childbirth method uses different breathing for the different stages of childbirth. The LeBoyer method stresses a relaxed delivery in a quiet, dim room. It attempts to avoid overstimulation of the baby and to foster mother-child bonding by placing the baby on the mother\u2019s abdomen and having the mother massage him or her immediately after the birth. Then the father washes the baby in a warm bath. The Bradley method is called father-coached child- birth, because it focuses on the father serving as coach throughout the process. It encourages normal activities during the first stages of labor. Resources BOOKS Carlson, Karen J., Stephanie A. Eisenstat, and Terra Ziporyn.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

          "content": "Precautions Because the implants are controversial, very expen- sive, and have uncertain results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited the implants to people: \u2022 who get no significant benefit from hearing aids \u2022 who are at least 2 years old (the age at which specialists can verify severity of deafness) \u2022 with severe to profound hearing loss. Description Hearing loss is caused by a number of different problems that occur either in the hearing nerve or parts of the middle or inner ear. The most common type of deaf- ness is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea, the hearing part of the inner ear. Normally, hair cells stimu- late the hearing nerve, which transmits sound signals to the brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearing nerve remains unstimulated, and the person can\u2019t hear. Hair cells can be destroyed by many things, including infection, trauma, loud noise, aging, or birth defects. All cochlear implants consist of a microphone worn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends it along a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in a small shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processor boosts the sound, filters out background noise, and turns sound into digital signals before sending it to a transmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds the transmitter in place through its attraction to the receiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgical- ly attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiver picks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter, and converts them into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses flow through electrodes contained in a narrow, flexible tube that has been threaded into the cochlea. As many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type of implant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearing nerve. The brain then interprets the signals as specific sounds. Despite the benefits that the implant appears to offer, some hearing specialists and members of the deaf com- munity still believe that the benefits may not outweigh the risks and limitations of the device. Because the device must be surgically implanted, it carries some sur- gical risk. Also, manufacturers can\u2019t promise how well a person will hear with an implant. Moreover, after getting an implant, some people say they feel alienated from the Deaf community, while at the same time not feeling fully a part of the hearing world. The sounds heard through an implant are different from the normal hearing sounds, and have been described as artificial or \u201crobotlike.\u201d This is because the implant\u2019s handful of electrodes cannot hope to match the complexity of a person\u2019s 15,000 hair cells. Surgical procedure During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge on the skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. The surgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone, and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. This operation takes between one and one-half to five hours. Preparation Before a person gets an implant, specialists at an implant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, including extensive hearing tests to determine how well the candi- date can hear. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will benefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per- son becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf- ness, the better the person is likely to understand speech with an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearing nerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve. First, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful hear- ing aid. If the aid can\u2019t improve hearing enough, a physi- cian then performs a physical exam and orders a scan of the inner ear (some patients with a scarred cochlea aren\u2019t good candidates). A doctor may also order a psychological exam to better understand the person\u2019s expectations. Patients need to be highly motivated, and have a realistic understanding of what an implant can and cannot do. Aftercare The patient remains in the hospital for a day or two after the surgery.

A clini- cican tunes the speech processor and sets levels of stimu- lation for each electrode, from soft to loud. The patient is then trained in how to interpret the sounds heard through the device. The length of the train- ing varies from days to years, depending on how well the person can interpret the sounds heard through the device. Risks As with all operations, there are a few risks of surgery. These include: \u2022 dizziness \u2022 facial paralysis (rarely) \u2022 infection at the incision site Scientists aren\u2019t sure about the long-term effects of electrical stimulation on the nervous system. It is also possible to damage the implant\u2019s internal components by a blow to the head, which will render the device unworkable. Normal results Most profoundly, deaf patients who receive an implant are able to discern medium and loud sounds, including speech, at comfortable listening levels. Many use sound clues from the implant, together with speech reading and other facial cues. Almost all adults improve their communication skills when combining the implant with speech reading (lip reading), and some can under- stand spoken words without speech reading. More than half of adults who lost hearing after they learned to speak can understand some speech without speech reading. About 30% can understand spoken sounds well enough to use the phone. Children who were born deaf or who lost their hear- ing before they could speak have the most difficulty in learning to use the implant. Research suggests, however, that most of these children are able to learn spoken lan- guage and understand speech using the implant. Resources BOOKS Clark, Graeme M., Robert S. C.

Performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility under local or general anesthetic, full recovery takes about three weeks but hearing should improve immediately. Tympanoplasty Tympanoplasty is performed to reconstruct the eardrum after partial or total conductive hearing loss, usually caused by chronic middle ear infections, or per- forations that do not heal. This is usually a same day surgery, performed under either local or general anesthe- sia. After making an incision in the ear to view the perfo- ration, the ear drum is elevated away from the ear canal and lifted forward. If the bones of hearing (ossicular chain) are functioning, tissue is taken from the ear and grafted to the eardrum to close the perforation. A thin sheet of silastic and Gelfoam hold the graft in place. The ear is stitched together, and a sterile patch is placed on the outside of the ear canal. Tympanoplasty is successful in over 90% of all cases. The need for ossicular recon- struction (reconstruction of tiny bones of the middle ear) is sometimes known before surgery and and even when identified during surgery, can usually be done while reconstructing the eardrum. If the gap between the anvil bone and the stapes is small, a small piece of bone or car- tilage from the patient can be inserted; if is is large, the incus bone is removed, modelled into a prosthesis, and reinserted between the stapes and the malleus. Recon- struction could also be achieved by inserting a strut made from artificial bone. For tympanoplasty with ossicular reconstruction, the patient usually stays in the hospital overnight. The recovery period is about four weeks. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed to drain ear fluid and prevent ear infections when antibi- otics don\u2019t work or when ear infections are chronic. The process normalizes pressure in the middle ear and decreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per- formed on infants and children, in whom ear infections are most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears. The surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, then uses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal or plastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continual drainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it stays in place, which varies from six months to three years. When the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of 25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubes may need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic for most children and a local anesthetic for older children or adults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce- dure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can go home the same day; children under three years of age and those with chronic diseases usually stay overnight. Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per- formed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. In most cases, this is performed in a surgeon\u2019s office using a topical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur- face of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and the eardrum to close. A thin patch placed on the eardrum\u2019s outer surface allows the skin under the eardrum to heal. Cochlear implants Cochlear implants stimulate nerve ends within the inner ear, enabling deaf children to hear. The device has a microphone that remains outside the ear, a processor that selects and codes speech sounds, and a receiver/stimulator to convert the coded sounds to electric signals that stimulate the hearing nerve and are recognized by the brain as sound. During surgery, an incision is made behind and slightly above the ear. A circular hole is drilled in the bone to receive the device\u2019s internal coil. The mastoid bone leading to the middle ear is opened to receive the electrodes. The internal coil is inserted and secured, followed by the electrodes. The wound is stitched up and when it heals, an external unit comprised of a stimulator with a microphone is worn behind the ear. Performed in a hospital under general anes- thesia, the operation takes about two hours and usually requires a hospital stay overnight. The patient can resume normal activities in two to three weeks.

Ear surgery is commonly performed to treat conductive hearing loss, persistent ear infections, unhealed perforated eardrums, congenital ear defects, and tumors. Ear surgery is performed on children and adults. In some cases, surgery is the only treatment; in others, it is used only when more conservative medical treatment fails. Precautions The precautions vary, depending on the type ofear surgery under consideration. For example, stapedecto- my (removal of parts of the middle ear and insertion of prosthesis parts) should not be performed on people with external or middle ear infection or inner ear disease. For people with complete hearing loss in the other ear, it should be performed cautiously. Microsurgery for the removal of a cholesteatoma (a cyst-like mass of cells in the middle ear) should not be performed on patients who are extremely ill or have other medical conditions. Tym- panoplasty (any surgical procedure on the eardrum or middle ear) should not be performed on patients with chronic sinus or nasal problems or in some patients with medical problems such as poorly controlled diabetes and heart disease. Surgery for congenital microtia and atresia (abscense of normal bodily openings, such as the outer ear canal) should not be performed if the middle ear space is totally or almost totally absent. Description Most ear surgery is microsurgery, performed with an operating microscope to enable the surgeon to view the very small structures of the ear. The use of minimally invasive laser surgery for middle ear procedures is growing. Laser surgery reduces the amount of trauma due to vibration, enhances coagulation, and enables sur- geons to access hard to reach places in the middle ear. Laser surgery can be performed in an office operating suite. Types of ear surgery include stapedectomy, tym- panoplasty, myringotomy and ear tube surgery, ear surgery to repair a perforated eardrum , cochlear implants, and tumor removal. Stapedectomy To restore hearing loss, which is usually due to oto- sclerosis, stapedectomy is performed. Stapedectomy is the removal of all or part of the stapes, one of the bones in the middle ear, and replacement with a tiny prosthesis. An incision is made in the middle ear, the small bones are identified, and the stapes is removed.

          "content": "Bystanders should check the patient\u2019s breathing and pulse rate. The pulse may be weak and slow. If there are no signs of breathing or heart rate, the problem is more serious than fainting, and cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion (CPR) must begin. If breathing and pulse rates seem normal, the person\u2019s legs should be raised above the level of the head so that gravity can help the blood flow to the brain. Belts, collars or any other constrictive clothing should be loosened. If the person does not regain consciousness within a minute or two after fainting, medical help should be summoned. Prognosis After a fainting spell, the person should regain nor- mal color but may continue to feel weak for a short time. Lying down quietly for a few moments may help. In most cases, an attack of fainting is not serious. As soon as the underlying pain or stress passes, the danger of repeated episodes also is eliminated. Prevention If a person is feeling faint, unconsciousness may be prevented by sitting with the head between the knees or lying flat with the legs raised. KEY TERMS Osteoarthritis \u2014A disease characterized by dam- age to the cartilage in the joints. The joints become inflamed, deformed, and enlarged, and movement becomes painful. Stokes-Adams syndrome \u2014Recurrent episodes of temporary loss of consciousness (fainting) caused by an insufficient flow of blood from the heart to the brain. This syndrome is caused by a very rapid or a very slow heartbeat. Transient ischemic attack (TIA)\u2014A brief interrup- tion of the blood supply to part of the brain that causes a temporary impairment of vision, speech, or movement. Usually, the episode lasts for just a few moments, but it may be a warning sign for a full-scale stroke. Vagus nerve\u2014A cranial nerve, that is, a nerve con- nected to the brain. The vagus nerve has branches to most of the major organs in the body, including the larynx, throat, windpipe, lungs, heart, and most of the digestive system. A person who has fainted should lie flat for 10\u201315 minutes after regaining consciousness to give the system a chance to regain its balance. Standing up too soon may bring on another fainting spell. Resources BOOKS Greenberg, David A., et al. Clinical Neurology.2nd ed. Nor- walk, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1993. Carol A.

Attacks usually last 12\u201372 hours, and can occasionally involve a skin rash. Kidney disease is a serious concern if the disorder is not treated. FMF is most prevalent in people of Armenian, Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and Turkish ancestry. Description FMF could be described as a disorder of \u201cinappro- priate\u201d inflammation. That is, an event that in a normal situation causes a mild or unnoticeable inflammation might cause a severe inflammatory response in someone with FMF. Certain areas of the body are at risk for FMF- related symptoms. A serosa is a serous (fluid-producing) membrane that can be found inside the abdominal cavity (peritoneum), around the lungs (pleura), around the heart (pericardium), and inside the joints (synovium). The symptoms of FMF are due to inflammation of one or more of the serosal membranes (serositis). Thus, FMF is also sometimes called recurrent polyserositis. During an attack, large numbers of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, move into the affected areas GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1281 Familial Mediterranean fever",

          "content": "restored by lying flat for a short time. This position puts the head on the same level as the heart so that blood flows more easily to the brain. A fainting episode may be completely harmless and of no significance, but it can be a symptom of a serious underlying disorder. No matter how trivial it seems, a fainting episode should be treated as a medical emer- gency until the cause is determined. Causes and symptoms Extreme pain, fear, or stress may bring on fainting. This type of fainting is caused by overstimulation of the vagus nerve, a nerve connected to the brain that helps con- trol breathing and circulation. In addition, a person who stands still or erect for too long may faint. This type of fainting occurs because blood pools in the leg veins, reducing the amount that is available for the heart to pump to the brain. This type of fainting is quite common in older people or those taking drugs to treat high blood pressure. When an older person feels faint upon turning the head or looking upward suddenly, the cause could be osteoarthritis of the neck bones. Osteoarthritis damages the cartilage between the neck bones and causes pressure on blood vessels leading to the brain. Fainting can be a symptom of a disease such as Stokes-Adams syndrome, a condition in which blood flow to the brain is temporarily reduced because of an irregular heartbeat. Some people may experience fainting associated with weakness in the limbs or a temporary problem in speaking caused by obstructed blood flow in vessels passing through the neck to the brain. Pregnant women frequently feel faint. Fainting may also occur as a result of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar can occur if a person skips a meal or has diabetes. Fainting can also be caused by: \u2022 prolonged coughing \u2022 straining to defecate or urinate \u2022 blowing a wind instrument too hard \u2022 remaining in a stuffy environment with too little oxygen Sometimes fainting may be caused by a temporary drop in the blood supply to the brain caused by a tran- sient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke, is a disruption in the blood supply to the brain caused by a blocked or burst blood vessel. Seek help immediately if a fainting spell is followed by one or more of the symptoms listed below: \u2022 numbness or tingling in any body part \u2022 blurred vision \u2022 confusion \u2022 difficulty speaking \u2022 loss of movement in arms or legs A few seconds before fainting, a person may sweat or become pale, feel nauseated or dizzy, and have blurred vision or racing heartbeat. Once the person loses con- sciousness, the pupils may dilate as the heart rate slows down. There may be abnormal movements. Muscles may tighten or the back may arch. These movements do not last long and they are not violent. In most cases, the patient regains consciousness within a few minutes, but the fainting spell may be fol- lowed by nervousness, headache, nausea, dizziness, pal- lor or sweating. The person may faint again, especially if he or she stands up within 30 minutes. Diagnosis Most episodes of fainting are a one-time occurrence. When a person experiences repeated fainting spells, a physician should be consulted. Treatment Most of the time, a person who faints ends up lying on the floor. If this happens, the patient should be rolled onto his or her back. Because someone who faints often vomits, bystanders should keep the airway open. A per- son who is fainting should not be held upright or in a sit- ting position. These positions prevent blood flow to the brain and may bring on a seizure.

          "content": "Failure to thrive may also result from lack of avail- able food or the quality of the food offered. This can be due to economic factors in the family, parental beliefs and concepts of nutrition, or neglect of the child. In addition, if the baby is being breast fed, the quality or quantity of the mother\u2019s milk may be the source of the problem. Psychosocial problems, often stemming from a lack of nurturing parent-child relations can lead to a failure to thrive. The child may exhibit poor appetite due to depres- sion from insufficient attention from parents. Infants and toddlers, whose growth is substantially less than expected, are considered to be suffering from FTT. Diagnosis Most babies are weighed at birth and that weight is used as a base line for future well-baby check-ups. If the baby is not gaining weight at a predictable rate, the doc- tor will do a more extensive examination. If there are no apparent physical deformities in the digestive tract, the doctor will examine the child\u2019s environment. As part of that examination, the doctor will look at the family histo- ry of height and weight. In addition, the parents will be asked about feedings, illnesses, and family routines. If the mother is breastfeeding the doctor will also evaluate her diet, general health, and well being as it affects the quantity and quality of her milk. Diagnosis of FTT is confirmed by a positive growth and behavioral response to increased nutrition. Treatment If there is an underlying physical reason for failure to thrive, such as a disorder of swallowing mechanism or intestinal problems, correcting that problem should reverse the condition. If the condition is caused by envi- ronmental factors, the physician will suggest several ways parents may provide adequate food for the child. Maternal education and parental counseling may also be recommended. In extreme cases, hospitalization or a more nurturing home may be necessary. Prognosis The first year of life is important as a foundation for growth and physical and intellectual development in the future. Children with extreme failure to thrive in the first year may never catch up to their peers even if their physi- cal growth improves. In about one third of these extreme cases, mental development remains below normal and roughly half will continue to have psychosocial and eat- ing problems throughout life. KEY TERMS Esophagus \u2014The muscular tube which connects the mouth and stomach. Psychosocial\u2014A term referring to the mind\u2019s abili- ty to, consciously or unconsciously, adjust and relate the body to its social environment. When failure to thrive is identified and corrected early, most children catch up to their peers and remain healthy and well developed. Prevention Initial failure to thrive caused by physical defects cannot be prevented but can often be corrected before they become a danger to the child. Maternal education and emotional and economic support systems all help to prevent failure to thrive in those cases where there is no physical deformity.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

          "content": "noted the infant can be seen, generally by a pediatric oph- thalmologist. A child with no symptoms should have an eye exam at age three. Early exams are important because permanent decreases in vision (e.g., amblyopia, also called lazy eye) can occur if not treated early (usually by ages 6\u20139). Again, with no other symptoms, the se cond exam should take place before first grade. After first grade, the American Optometric Association recom- mends an eye exam every two years; ages 19\u201340, every two to three years; ages 41\u201360, every two years; and annually after that. However, these are recommendations for healthy people with no risk factors. Patients should ask their doctors how often they should come for exams. Some patients have risk factors for eye disease (e.g., peo- ple with diabetes or a family history of eye disease; African Americans, who are at higher risk for glaucoma) and may need more frequent checkups. Also, if children seem to be having trouble in school, problems with read- ing, rubbing their eyes when reading, etc., an eye exam may be necessary sooner. Precautions The examiner needs to know if the patient is taking any medications or has any existing health conditions. Some medications, even over-the-counter (OTC) medica- tions can affect vision or even interfere with the eyedrops the doctor may use during the exam. Certain eyedrops would not be used if the patient has asthma, heart prob- lems, or other conditions. The patient may need someone to drive them home in case the eyes were dilated. Bringing sunglasses to the exam may also help decrease the glare from light until the dilating drops wear off. Description An eye examination, given by an ophthalmologist or optometrist, costs about $100. It may or may not be cov- ered by insurance. It begins with information from the patient (case history) and continues with a set of primary tests, plus additional specialized tests given as needed, dic- tated by the outcomes of initial testing and the patient\u2019s age. The primary tests can be divided into two groups, those that evaluate the physical state of the eyes and sur- rounding areas, and those that measure the ability to see. The order of the tests for the exam may differ from doctor to doctor, however, most exams will include the following procedures: Information gathering and initial observations The examiner will take eye and medical histories that include the patient\u2019s chief complaint, any past eye disor- ders, all medications being taken (e.g., OTC medications, antibiotics , and birth control pills), any blood relatives with eye disorders, and any systemic disorders the patient may have. The patient should also tell the doctor about hobbies and work conditions. This information helps in modifying prescriptions and lets the doctor know how the patient uses his or her eyes. For example, using a comput- er screen vs. construction work, the working distance of a computer screen may affect the prescription; the con- struction worker needs protective eyewear. The patient should bring their current pair of glasses to the exam. The doctor can get the prescription from the glasses by using an instrument called a lensometer. Visual acuity examination Visual acuity measures how clearly the patient can see. It is measured for each eye separately, with and without the current prescription. It is usually measured with a Snellen eye chart, a poster with lines of different- sized letters, each line with a number at the side denoting the distance from which a person with normal vision can read that line. Other kinds of eye charts with identifiable figures are available for children or anyone unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet. These charts are made to be placed at a certain distance (usually 20 ft) from the per- son being tested. At this distance, people with normal vision can read a certain line (usually the lowest), marked the 20/20 line; these people are said to have 20/20 vision. For people who can\u2019t read the smallest line, the examiner assigns a ratio based on the smallest line they can read. The first number (numerator) of the ratio is the distance between the chart and the patient, and the second number (denominator) is the distance where a person with normal vision would be able to read that line. The ratio 20/40 means the patient can see at 20 ft. what people with normal vision can see at 40 ft. away. When a patient is unable to read any lines on the chart, they are moved closer until they can read the line with the largest letters. The acuity is still measured the same way. A ratio of 5/200 means the person being tested can see at 5 ft what a normal person can see 200 ft. When a patient can\u2019t read the chart at all, the exam- iner may hold up some fingers and ask the patient to count them at various distances, and records the result as \u201ccounting fingers\u201d at the distance of recognition. If the patient cannot count the examiner\u2019s fingers at any dis- tance, the examiner determines if the patient can see hand movements. If so, the result is recorded as \u201chand movements.\u201d If not, the examiner determines if the patient can detect light from a penlight. If the patient can detect the light but not its direction, the result is recorded at \u201clight perception.\u201d If the patient can recognize its GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1262 Eye examination",

Some possible causes include AIDS (Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma) or increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays which may lead to skin cancer. Diagnosis An instrument called a slit lamp is generally used to magnify the structures of the eyes. The doctor may press on the lid margin to see if oil can be expressed from the meibomian glands. The doctor may invert the lid to see the inside of the lid. Biopsy is used to diagnose cancer- ous tumors. Treatment Stye Styes are treated with warm-hot compresses for 10\u201315 minutes, three to four times a day. Sometimes top- ical antibiotics may be prescribed. If the initial treatment is ineffective, styes are lanced and drained. Chalazion About 25% of chalazia will disappear spontaneous- ly, but hot compresses may speed the process. Because chalazia are inside the lid, topical medications are gener- ally of no benefit. Medication may need to be injected by the doctor into the chalazion or if that doesn\u2019t help the chalazion may need to be excised. If what appears to be a chalazion recurs on the same site as any previous one, the possibility of sebaceous gland carcinoma should be investigated by biopsy. Blepharitis Blepharitis is treated with hot compresses, with antibiotic ointment, and by cleaning the eyelids with a moist washcloth and then with baby shampoo. Good hygiene is essential. If the blepharitis doesn\u2019t clear up with treatment or if it seems to be a chronic problem, the patient may have acnerosacea. These patients may need to see a dermatologist as well. Entropion and ectropion Both entropion and ectropion can be surgically cor- rected. Prior to surgery, the lower lid of entropion can be taped down to keep the lashes off the eye, and both can be treated with lubricating drops to keep the cornea moist. Eyelid edema Patients with swollen eyelids should contact their eye doctor. A severely swollen lid can press on the eye and possibly increase the intraocular pressure. An infec- tion needs to be ruled out. Or, something as simple as an allergy to nail polish and then touching the eyes can cause swelling. The best treatment for allergic eyelid edema is to find and remove the substance causing the allergy. When that is not possible, as in the case of plant allergens, cold compresses and immunosuppresesive drugs such as corticosteroid creams are helpful. Howev- er, steroids can cause cataracts and increase intraocular pressure and patients must be very careful not to get the cream in their eyes. This should not be done unless under a doctor\u2019s care. For edema caused by trichinosis, the trichinosis must be treated. Eyelid tumors Cancerous tumors should be removed upon discov- ery, and noncancerous tumors should be removed before they become big enough to interfere with vision or eyelid function. Eyelid tumors require special consideration because of their sensitive location. It is important that treatment not compromise vision, eye movement, or eye- lid movement. Accordingly, eyelid reconstruction will sometimes accompany tumor excision. Prognosis The prognosis for styes and chalazia is good to excellent. With treatment, blepharitis, ectropion, and entropion usually have good outcomes. The prognosis for nonmalignant tumors, basal cell carcinoma, and squa- mous cell carcinoma is good once they are properly removed. Survival rate for malignant melanoma depends upon how early it was discovered and if it was complete- ly removed. Sebaceous carcinomas are difficult to detect, so poor outcomes are more frequent.

When a stressful or traumatic experience triggers the reemergence of these dissociated parts, the patient may act differently, answer to a different name, or appear confused by his or her surroundings. Diagnosis When a doctor is evaluating a patient with dissocia- tive symptoms, he or she will first rule out physical con- ditions that sometimes produce amnesia, depersonaliza- tion, or derealization. These physical conditions include epilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med- ications, substance abuse, intoxication, AIDS, dementia complex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress and sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give the patient an electroencephalogram (EEG) to exclude epilepsy or other seizure disorders. If the patient appears to be physically normal, the doctor will rule out psychotic disturbances, including schizophrenia . In addition, doctors can use some psy- chological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen- er, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). If the patient has a high score on this test, he or she can be eval- uated further with the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). It is also pos- sible for doctors to measure a patient\u2019s hypnotizability as part of a diagnostic evaluation. Treatment Treatment of the dissociative disorders often com- bines several methods. Psychotherapy Patients with dissociative disorders often require treatment by a therapist with some specialized under- standing of dissociation. This background is particularly important if the patient\u2019s symptoms include identity problems. Many patients with dissociative disorders are helped by group as well as individual treatment. Medications Some doctors will prescribe tranquilizers or antide- pressants for the anxiety and/or depression that often accompany dissociative disorders. Patients with dissocia- tive disorders are, however, at risk for abusing or becom- ing dependent on medications. As of 2001, there is no drug that can reliably counteract dissociation itself. Hypnosis Hypnosis is frequently recommended as a method of treatment for dissociative disorders, partly because hyp- KEY TERMS Amnesia \u2014A general medical term for loss of memory that is not due to ordinary forgetfulness. Amnesia can be caused by head injuries, brain disease, or epilepsy, as well as by dissociation. Depersonalization \u2014A dissociative symptom in which the patient feels that his or her body is unre- al, is changing, or is dissolving. Derealization \u2014A dissociative symptom in which the external environment is perceived as unreal. Dissociation \u2014A psychological mechanism that allows the mind to split off traumatic memories or disturbing ideas from conscious awareness. Fugue\u2014A dissociative experience during which a person travels away from home, has amnesia for their past, and may be confused about their identi- ty but otherwise appear normal.

Hypnosis may help patients recover repressed ideas and memories. Therapists treating patients with DID sometimes use hypnosis in the process of \u201cfusing\u201d the patient\u2019s alternate personalities. Prognosis Prognoses for dissociative disorders vary. Recovery from dissociative fugue is usually rapid. Dissociative amnesia may resolve quickly, but can become a chronic disorder in some patients. Depersonalization disorder, DDNOS, and DID are usually chronic conditions. DID usually requires five or more years of treatment for recovery.

The most important part of diagnosis is determining the cause of the delirium. Tests may include blood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec- trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum- bar puncture (\u201cspinal tap\u201d) to test for central nervous system infection; x ray, computed tomography scans (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali- ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec- trocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated by the likely cause. Treatment Treatment of delirium begins with recognizing and treating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managed by reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothing ones; use of simple, clear language in communication; and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi- cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger to himself or others, or if he insists on removing necessary medical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors. Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions. Prognosis Persons with delirium usually have a worse prog- nosis for the underlying disease than the person with- out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill- ness usually recover from delirium. They may not, however, regain all their original cognitive abilities, and may be left with some permanent impairments, including fatigue , irritability, difficulty concentrating, or mood changes. Prevention Prevention of delirium is focused on treating or avoiding its underlying causes. The most preventable forms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducing delirium include following prescriptions, consulting the prescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur, and consulting the physician before discontinuing the drug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica- tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professional assistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive drug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri- tion, which promotes general health and can minimize the likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication and withdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti- cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home or workplace.

These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning, and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre- sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompanied by hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia , which act to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusions are distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefs that may be seen as untrue by outsiders. Description Delusions are a common symptom of several mood and personality-related mental illnesses, including schizoaffective disorder , schizophrenia , shared psy- chotic disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder . They are also the major feature of delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder suffer from long-term, complex delusions that fall into one of six categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero- tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusional disorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or physical causes. Persecutory Individuals with persecutory delusional disorder are plagued by feelings of paranoia and an irrational yet unshakable belief that someone is plotting against them, or out to harm them.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrolyte disorders Definition An electrolyte disorder is an imbalance of certain ionized salts (i.e., bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, magne- sium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium) in the blood. Description Electrolytes are ionized molecules found throughout the blood, tissues, and cells of the body. These mole- cules, which are either positive (cations) or negative (anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance pH and acid-base levels in the body. Electrolytes also facilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells through a process known as osmosis and play a part in regulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine, and excretory systems. The serum electrolytes include: \u2022 Sodium (Na). A positively charged electrolyte that helps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates neuromuscular functioning. \u2022 Potassium (K). A main component of cellular fluid, this positive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular function and osmotic pressure. \u2022 Calcium (Ca). A cation, or positive electrolyte, that affects neuromuscular performance and contributes to skeletal growth and blood coagulation. \u2022 Magnesium (Mg). Influences muscle contractions and intracellular activity. A cation. \u2022 Chloride (CI). An anion, or negative electrolyte, that regulates blood pressure. \u2022 Phosphate (HPO4). Negative electrolyte that impacts metabolism and regulates acid-base balance and calci- um levels. \u2022 Bicarbonate (HCO3). A negatively charged electrolyte that assists in the regulation of blood pH levels. Bicar- bonate insufficiencies and elevations cause acid-base disorders (i.e., acidosis, alkalosis). Medications, chronic diseases, and trauma (i.e., burns, fractures, etc. ) may cause the concentration of certain electrolytes in the body to become too high (hyper-) or too low (hypo-). When this happens, an elec- trolyte imbalance, or disorder, results. Causes and symptoms Sodium HYPERNATREMIA. Sodium helps the kidneys to regu- late the amount of water the body retains or excretes. Consequently, individuals with elevated serum sodium levels also suffer from a loss of fluids, or dehydration . Hypernatremia can be caused by inadequate water intake, excessive fluid loss (i.e., diabetes insipidus, kid- ney disease, severe burns, and prolonged vomiting or diarrhea), or sodium retention (caused by excessive sodi- um intake or aldosteronism).

Preparation Full instructions should be given to EEG patients when they schedule their test. Typically, individuals on medications that affect the central nervous system, such as anticonvulsants, stimulants, or antidepressants, are told to discontinue their prescription for a short time prior to the test (usually one to two days). Patients may be asked to avoid food and beverages that contain caf- feine, a central nervous system stimulant. However, any such request should be cleared by the treating physician. Patients may also be asked to arrive for the test with clean hair free of spray or other styling products. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG may be asked to remain awake the night before their test. They may be given a sedative prior to the test to induce sleep. Aftercare If the patient has suspended regular medication for the test, the EEG nurse or technician should advise him when he can begin taking it again. Risks Being off medication for one to two days may trigger seizures. Certain procedures used during EEG may trig- ger seizures in patients with epilepsy. Those procedures include flashing lights and deep breathing. If the EEG is being used as a diagnostic for epilepsy (i.e., to determine the type of seizures an individual is suffering from), this may be a desired effect, although the patient needs to be monitored closely so that the seizure can be aborted if necessary. This type of test is known as an ictal EEG. Normal results In reading and interpreting brainwave patterns, a neurologist or other physician will evaluate the type of brainwaves and the symmetry, location, and consistency of brainwave patterns. He will also look at the brain- wave response to certain stimuli presented during the EEG test (such as flashing lights or noise). There are four basic types of brainwaves: alpha, beta, theta, and delta. \u201cNormal\u201d brainwave patterns vary widely, depending on factors of age and activity. For example, awake and relaxed individuals typically register an alpha wave pattern of eight to 13 cycles per second.

Diagnosis Diagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological exam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. A thorough family history should be taken at this time to deter- mine if other people in the family are affected. Testing may also be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy. A nerve conduction velocity test should be per- formed to measure how fast impulses travel through the nerves. This test may show characteristic features of CMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conduction testing may be combined with electromyography (EMG), an electrical test of the muscles. A nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the nerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris- tic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic of CMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet- ic testing, usually performed by drawing a small amount of blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detect mutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However, research is progressing rapidly and new testing is often made available every few months. All affected members of a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once a mutation is found in one affected member, it is possible to test other members who may have symptoms or are at risk of developing CMT. Prenatal diagnosis Testing during pregnancy to determine whether an unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a family has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation. This can be done after 10\u201312 weeks of pregnancy using a procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam- ining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente- sis after 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing the cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a small risk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are interested in learning more should check with their doctor or genetic counselor. Couples interested in these options should obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all of the benefits and limitations of these procedures. Treatment There is no cure for CMT. However, physical and occupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat- ment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motion and minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, or contracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control of the lower extremities that can help tremendously with balance. After wearing braces, people often find that they have more energy because they are using less energy to focus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used to provide devices and techniques that can assist tasks such as dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities of daily life. V oice-activated software can also help people who have problems with fine motor control. It is very important that people with CMT avoid injury that causes them to be immobile for long periods of time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to return to their original strength after injury. There is a long list of medications that should be avoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such as hydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B6, and D, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com- plete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo- ple considering taking any of these medications should weigh the risks and benefits with their physician. Prognosis The symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly over many years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy. The majority of people with CMT do not need to use a wheelchair during their lifetime. Most people with CMT are able to lead full and productive lives despite their physical challenges.

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test.

It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants. However, cough KEY TERMS Antitussives\u2014Drugs used to suppress coughing. Expectorant\u2014Drug used to thin mucus. Gastroesophageal reflux \u2014Condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Glottis\u2014The opening between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx. Larynx\u2014A part of the respiratory tract between the pharynx and the trachea, having walls of cartilage and muscle and containing the vocal cords. Sputum\u2014The mixture of mucus, irritants, and other substances expelled from the lungs by coughing. medicines may be given if the patient cannot rest because of the cough or if the cough is not productive, as is the case with most coughs associated with colds or flu. The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under- lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942 Cough",

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

Barstow, RN Electrocution see Electric shock injuries Electroencephalography Definition Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a neurological test that uses an electronic monitoring device to measure and record electrical activity in the brain. Purpose The EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage- ment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also used to assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g., stroke, tumors, encephalitis), mental retardation, sleep disorders, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s dis- ease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and certain mental disor- ders (e.g.,alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism). An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity during surgery and to determine brain death. Precautions Electroencephalography should be administered and interpreted by a trained medical professional only. Data from an EEG is only one element of a complete medical and/or psychological patient assessment, and should never be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis. Description Before the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach- es approximately 16\u201320 electrodes to the patient\u2019s scalp with a conductive, washable paste. Depending on the purpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodes are occasionally used. Implantable electrodes include sphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires inserted under the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec- trodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain. The EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea- sure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain. For the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table, or comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain still during the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes no more than one hour. During the test procedure, the patient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visual stimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board may be used to stimulate certain types of brain activity. Throughout the procedure, the electroencephalograph machine makes a continuous graphic record of the patient\u2019s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip of recording paper or on a computer screen. This graphic record is called an electroencephalogram. The sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce- dures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG are encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than just relax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet room conducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours. In an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a portable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor- mal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for a period of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patient and patient\u2019s family record any symptoms or abnormal behaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG to see if they represent seizures. Many insurance plans provide reimbursement for EEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to more than $500, depending on the purpose and type of test (i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec- trodes).

The normal concentra- tion of serum magnesium is in the range of 2.0\u20133.0 mg/dL. The normal concentration range of chloride is 350\u2013375 mg/dL or 98\u2013106 mM. The normal level of phosphate, as expressed as the concentration of phospho- rus, is 2.0\u20134.3 mg/dL. Bicarbonate is an electrolyte that is freely and spontaneously interconvertable with carbon- ic acid and carbon dioxide. The normal concentration of carbonic acid (H 2CO3) is about 1.35 mM. The normal concentration of bicarbonate (HCO 3 /H11002 ) is about 27 mM. The concentration of total carbon dioxide is the sum of carbonic acid and bicarbonate; this sum is normally in the range of 26\u201328 mM. The ratio of bicarbonate/carbon- ic acid is more significant than the actual concentrations of these two forms of carbon dioxide. Its normal value is 27/1.35 (equivalent to 20/1). Abnormal results Positively charged electrolytes High serum sodium levels (hypernatremia) occur at sodium concentrations over 145 mM, with severe hyper- natremia over 152 mM. Hypernatremia is usually caused by diseases that cause excessive urination. In these cases, water is lost, but sodium is still retained in the body. The symptoms include confusion and can lead to convulsions and coma. Low serum sodium levels (hyponatremia) are below 130 mM, with severe hyponatremia at or below 125 mM. Hyponatremia often occurs with severe diarrhea, with losses of both water and sodium, but with sodium loss exceeding water loss. Hyponatremia provokes clinical problems only if serum sodium falls below 125 mM, espe- cially if this has occurred rapidly. The symptoms can be as mild as tiredness but may lead to convulsions and coma. High serum potassium ( hyperkalemia) occurs at potassium levels above 5.0 mM; it is considered severe over 8.0 mM. Hyperkalemia is relatively uncommon, but sometimes occurs in patients with kidney failure who take potassium supplements. Hyperkalemia can result in abnor- mal beating of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias). Low serum potassium ( hypokalemia) occurs when serum potassium falls below 3.0 mM. It can result from low dietary potassium, as during starvation or in patients with anorexia nervosa; from excessive losses via the kidneys, as caused by diuretic drugs; or by diseases of the adrenal or pituitary glands. Mild hypokalemia causes muscle weakness, while severe hypokalemia can cause paralysis, the inability to breathe, and cardiac arrhythmias. High levels of calcium ions ( hypercalcemia) occur at free calcium ion concentrations over 5.2 mg/dL or total serum calcium above 10.4 mg/dL. Hypercalcemia usually occurs when the body dissolves bone at an abnor- mally fast rate, increasing both serum calcium and serum phosphate. Sudden hypercalcemia can cause vomiting and coma, while prolonged and moderate hypercalcemia results in the deposit of calcium phosphate crystals in the kidneys and eye. Hypocalcemia occurs when serum free calcium ions fall below 4.4 mg/dL, or when total serum calcium falls below 8.8 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can result from hypoparathyroidism (low parathyroid hormone), from failure to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, from low levels of plasma magnesium, and from phosphate poisoning (the phosphate enters the bloodstream and forms a complex with the free serum calcium). Hypocal- cemia can cause depression and muscle spasms. Hypermagnesemia occurs at serum magnesium lev- els over 25 mM (60 mg/dL). Hypermagnesemia is rare but can occur with the excessive consumption of magne- sium salts. Hypomagnesemia occurs when serum magne- sium levels fall below 0.8 mM, and can result from poor nutrition . Chronic alcoholism is the most common cause of hypomagnesemia, in part because of poor diet. Magnesium levels below 0.5 mM (1.2 mg/dL) cause serum calcium levels to decline. Some of the symptoms of hypomagnesemia, including twitching and convul- sions, actually result from the concurrent hypocalcemia. Hypomagnesemia can also result in hypokalemia and thereby cause cardiac arrhythmias. Negatively charged electrolytes Serum chloride levels sometimes increase to abnor- mal levels as an undesirable side effect of medical treat- ment with sodium chloride or ammonium chloride. The toxicity of chloride results not from the chloride itself, but from the fact that the chloride occurs as the acid, hydro- gen chloride (more commonly known as hydrochloric acid, or HCl). An overdose of chloride may cause the accumulation of hydrochloric acid in the bloodstream, with consequent acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis, one of many kidney diseases, involves the failure to release acid into the urine. The acidosis produces weakness, headache, nausea, and cardiac arrest. Low plasma chlo- ride leads to the opposite situation: a decline in the acid content of the bloodstream. This is known as alkalization of the bloodstream, or alkalosis. Hydrochloric acid, origi- nally from extracellular fluids, can be lost by vomiting. At its most severe, alkalosis results in paralysis (tetany). Hyperphosphatemia occurs at serum phosphate levels above 5 mg/dL. It can result from the failure of the kidneys to excrete phosphate into the urine, causing phosphate to accumulate in the bloodstream. Hyperphosphatemia can also be caused by the impaired action of parathyroid hor- mone and by phosphate poisoning. Severe hyperphos- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1158 Electrolyte tests",

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrolyte disorders Definition An electrolyte disorder is an imbalance of certain ionized salts (i.e., bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, magne- sium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium) in the blood. Description Electrolytes are ionized molecules found throughout the blood, tissues, and cells of the body. These mole- cules, which are either positive (cations) or negative (anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance pH and acid-base levels in the body. Electrolytes also facilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells through a process known as osmosis and play a part in regulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine, and excretory systems. The serum electrolytes include: \u2022 Sodium (Na). A positively charged electrolyte that helps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates neuromuscular functioning. \u2022 Potassium (K). A main component of cellular fluid, this positive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular function and osmotic pressure. \u2022 Calcium (Ca). A cation, or positive electrolyte, that affects neuromuscular performance and contributes to skeletal growth and blood coagulation. \u2022 Magnesium (Mg). Influences muscle contractions and intracellular activity. A cation. \u2022 Chloride (CI). An anion, or negative electrolyte, that regulates blood pressure. \u2022 Phosphate (HPO4). Negative electrolyte that impacts metabolism and regulates acid-base balance and calci- um levels. \u2022 Bicarbonate (HCO3). A negatively charged electrolyte that assists in the regulation of blood pH levels. Bicar- bonate insufficiencies and elevations cause acid-base disorders (i.e., acidosis, alkalosis). Medications, chronic diseases, and trauma (i.e., burns, fractures, etc. ) may cause the concentration of certain electrolytes in the body to become too high (hyper-) or too low (hypo-). When this happens, an elec- trolyte imbalance, or disorder, results. Causes and symptoms Sodium HYPERNATREMIA. Sodium helps the kidneys to regu- late the amount of water the body retains or excretes. Consequently, individuals with elevated serum sodium levels also suffer from a loss of fluids, or dehydration . Hypernatremia can be caused by inadequate water intake, excessive fluid loss (i.e., diabetes insipidus, kid- ney disease, severe burns, and prolonged vomiting or diarrhea), or sodium retention (caused by excessive sodi- um intake or aldosteronism).

          "content": "Electrolyte tests Definition Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged molecules, called ions, that are found within cells, between cells, in the bloodstream, and in other fluids throughout the body. Electrolytes with a positive charge include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; the negative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. The concentrations of these ions in the bloodstream remain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthy person. Changes in the concentration of one or more of these ions can occur during various acute and chronic disease states and can lead to serious consequences. Purpose Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes are useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues for the diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests are used for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss of nutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea ,o r abnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte within the body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is detect- ed, the physician may either act to immediately correct the imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) or run further tests to determine the underlying cause of the abnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances can occur with malfunctioning of the kidney (renal failure), infections that produce severe and continual diarrhea or vomiting, drugs that cause loss of electrolytes in the urine (diuretics), poisoning due to accidental consump- tion of electrolytes, or diseases involving hormones that regulate electrolyte concentrations. Precautions Electrolyte tests are performed from routine blood tests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairly uniform throughout the United States. During the prepa- ration of blood plasma or serum, health workers must take care not to break the red blood cells, especially when testing for serum potassium. Because the concen- tration of potassium within red blood cells is much high- er than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cells would cause falsely elevated potassium levels. Description Electrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood plasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytes can be classified in at least five different ways. One way is that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells, or are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells, or are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne- sium occur at much greater levels inside the cell than outside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greater levels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish- es those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans- mission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium, potassium, and calcium are the important electrolytes involved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting them are most closely associated with neurological disorders. A third classification focuses on electrolytes that are able to form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal- cium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to form complexes with each other. Disorders that cause an increase in either plasma calcium or phosphate can result in the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the soft tissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns those electrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of the bloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood- stream is normally in the range of 7.35\u20137.45. A decrease below this range is called acidosis, while a pH above this range is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closely associated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon- ate, chloride, and phosphate. Preparation All electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or serum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam- ple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical that prevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum is prepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in a test tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneously clots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from a vein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with a centrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot. Normal results Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea- sured in serum or plasma. Values can be expressed in terms of weight per unit volume (mg/deciliter; mg/dL) or in the number of molecules in a volume, or molarity (moles or millimoles/liter; M or mM). The range of nor- mal values sometimes varies slightly between different age groups, for males and females, and between different analytical laboratories. The normal level of serum sodium is in the range of 136\u2013145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are 3.5\u20135.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at a much higher concentration than potassium. The normal concentration of total serum calcium (bound calcium plus free calcium) is in the range of 8.8\u201310.4 mg/dL. About 40% of the total calcium in the plasma is loosely bound to proteins; this GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1157 Electrolyte tests",

          "content": "phatemia can cause paralysis, convulsions, and cardiac arrest. These symptoms result because the phosphate, occurring in elevated levels, complexes with free serum calcium, resulting in hypocalcemia. Tests for heart func- tion (an electrocardiogram) and parathyroid hormone lev- els are used in the diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia occurs if serum phosphorus falls to 2.0 mg/dL or lower. It often results from a shift of inorgan- ic phosphate from the bloodstream to various organs and tissues. This shift can be caused by a rise in pH (alkaliza- tion) of the bloodstream, which can occur during hyper- ventilation, a reaction in various disease states. A shift in phosphate to intracellular tissues may draw calcium away from the bloodstream via the formation of insoluble calci- um phosphate crystals within cells, with consequent hypocalcemia. Thus, tests for abnormalities in phosphate metabolism also involve tests for serum calcium. Bicarbonate metabolism involves several com- pounds. When dietary starches, sugars, and fats are bro- ken down for energy production, carbon dioxide is creat- ed. Much of this carbon dioxide (CO 2) spontaneously converts to carbonic acid (H 2CO3), and some of the car- bonic acid spontaneously converts to bicarbonate (HCO 3 /H11002 ) plus a hydrogen ion (H + ). Eventually, almost every molecule of carbon dioxide produced in the body, whether in the form of carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, or bicarbonate, must convert back to carbon dioxide in order to leave via the lungs during normal breathing. If one holds one\u2019s breath, carbon dioxide cannot escape from the lungs, but continues to be generated with- in the body. This results in an increase in production of carbonic acid. A portion of the carbonic acid breaks apart (dissociates), causing an increase in hydrogen ions in the plasma, with a resulting acidosis. Tests for serum bicar- bonate levels are accompanied by tests for acidosis (pH test). Conversely, when one breathes too rapidly (hyper- ventilation), the carbon dioxide is drawn off from the bloodstream and expelled in the breath at an increased rate. This results in an increase in the rate of combination of bicarbonate with hydrogen ions, resulting in alkalosis. Acidosis and alkalosis can be produced by means other than by altering the rate of breathing. The carbonic acid and bicarbonate in the bloodstream minimize (or buffer) any trend to acidosis or alkalosis. Tests for bicarbonate are generally accompanied by tests for blood pH and pos- sibly tests for kidney malfunction, abnormal hormone function, or gastrointestinal disorders.

Tom Brody, PhD Electromyography Definition Electromyography (EMG) is an electrical recording of muscle activity that aids in the diagnosis of neuromus- cular disease. Purpose Muscles are stimulated by signals from nerve cells called motor neurons. This stimulation causes electrical activity in the muscle, which in turn causes contraction. This electrical activity is detected by a needle electrode inserted into the muscle and connected to a recording device. Together, the electrode and recorder are called an electromyography machine. EMG can determine whether a particular muscle is responding appropriately to stimu- lation, and whether a muscle remains inactive when not stimulated. EMG is performed most often to help diagnose dif- ferent diseases causing weakness. Although EMG is a test of the motor system, it may help identify abnormali- ties of nerves or spinal nerve roots that may be associated with pain or numbness. Other symptoms for which EMG may be useful include numbness, atrophy, stiffness, fas- ciculation, cramp, deformity, and spasticity. EMG results can help determine whether symptoms are due to a mus- cle disease or a neurological disorder, and, when com- bined with clinical findings, usually allow a confident diagnosis. EMG can help diagnose many muscle and nerve dis- orders, including: \u2022 muscular dystrophy \u2022 congenital myopathies \u2022 mitochondrial myopathies GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1159 Electromyography",

Frey Famine fever see Relapsing fever Fanconi\u2019s syndrome Definition Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor- ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc- tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal- cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the body. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth. Description Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body needs in the blood and putting what the body doesn\u2019t need into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is performed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered through a kidney structure with small holes that keep the cells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of the small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body, are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome. As a consequence, substances that are normally reabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins, water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and phosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn- drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular syndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debr\u00e9-Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi\u2019s anemia is, however, a totally different disease. Causes and symptoms Causes Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be caused by a variety of genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults. The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause in children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease, hereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome, Wilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease, vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome. Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium, lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like outdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances (like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine taken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans- plantation. Symptoms Fanconi\u2019s syndrome symptoms related directly to impaired absorption include excessive urine production and urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa- tion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu- cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and protein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels of phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively acidic blood. The most noticeable indirect consequences of impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and osteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated with bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty walking. If a person acquires Fanconi\u2019s syndrome as an adult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is accompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac- tures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and occasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of the ineffective reabsorption. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be made by urine and blood tests. It is also important to find the underlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Other symptoms specific to a particular patient will point to other useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290 Fanconi\u2019s syndrome",

          "content": "Diabetic neuropathy Definition Diabetic neuropathy is a nerve disorder caused by diabetes mellitus . Diabetic neuropathy may be diffuse, affecting several parts of the body, or focal, affecting a specific nerve and part of the body. Description The nervous system consists of two major divisions: the central nervous systems (CNS) which includes the brain, the cranial nerves, and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which includes the nerves that link the CNS with the sensory organs, mus- cles, blood vessels, and glands of the body. These periph- eral nerves are either motor, meaning that they are involved in motor activity such as walking, or sensory, meaning that they carry sensory information back to the CNS. The PNS also works with the CNS to regulate involuntary (autonomic) processes such as breathing, heartbeat, blood pressure, etc. There are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy that affect different nervous system functions. Diffuse peripheral neuropathy primarily affects the limbs, dam- aging the nerves of the feet and hands. Autonomic neu- ropathy is the other form of diffuse neuropathy and it affects the heart and other internal organs. Focal\u2014or localized\u2014diabetic neuropathy affects specific nerves, most commonly in the torso, leg, or head. Diabetic neuropathy can lead to muscular weakness, loss of feeling or sensation, and loss of autonomic func- tions such as digestion, erection, bladder control and sweating among others. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely the development of one or more forms of neuropathy. Approximately 60\u201370% of patients with diabetes have neuropathy, but only about 5% will experience painful symptoms. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of diabetic neuropathy is not known. Researchers believe that the process of nerve damage is related to high glucose concentrations in the blood that could cause chemical changes in nerves, dis- rupting their ability to effectively send messages. High blood glucose is also known to damage the blood vessels that carry oxygen and other nutrients to the nerves. In addition, some people may have a genetic predisposition to develop neuropathy. There is a wide range of symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy, and they depend on which nerves and parts of the body affected and also on the type of neuropathy present. Some patients have very mild symp- toms, while others are severely disabled. Common symptoms of diffuse peripheral neuropa- thy include: \u2022 numbness and feelings of tingling or burning \u2022 insensitivity to pain \u2022 needle-like jabs of pain \u2022 extreme sensitivity to touch \u2022 loss of balance and coordination Common symptoms of diffuse autonomic neuropa- thy include: \u2022 impaired urination and sexual function \u2022 bladder infections \u2022 stomach disorders, due to the impaired ability of the stomach to empty (gastric stasis) \u2022 nausea, vomiting, bloating \u2022 dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells \u2022 loss of appetite Common symptoms of focal neuropathy include: \u2022 pain in the front of a thigh \u2022 severe pain in the lower back \u2022 pain in the chest or stomach \u2022 ache behind an eye \u2022 double vision \u2022 paralysis on one side of the face In severe diabetic neuropathy loss of sensation can lead to injuries that are unnoticed, progressing to infec- tions, ulceration, and possibly amputation. Diagnosis The diagnosis of neuropathy is based on the symp- toms that present during a physical exam. Pain assess- ment is usually the first step. Patients may have more than one type of pain, and the history helps the doctor determine whether a the pain has a neuropathic cause. The exam may include: \u2022 a screening test for lost sensation \u2022 nerve conduction studies to check the flow of electric current through a nerve \u2022 electromyography (EMG) to see how well muscles respond to electrical impulses transmitted by nearby nerves.

Krajewski, MS, CGC Charcot\u2019s joints Definition Charcot\u2019s joints is a progressive degenerative disease of the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in the loss of ability to feel pain in the joint and instability of the joint. Description Charcot\u2019s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis- ease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint. The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint due to nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to the joint go unnoticed leading to instability and making the joint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated small injuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until finally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro- tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegration of the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint. Although this condition can affect any joint, the knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals with diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it may affect two or three joints. More than three affected joints is very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affected depends on the location of the nerve damage. Causes and symptoms Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil- ity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, spinal injuries and diseases,alcoholism, and even syphilis can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in some areas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital. The symptoms of Charcot\u2019s joints can go unnoticed for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint without the expected pain, or with less pain than would be expected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. As the condition progresses, however, the joint can become very painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths. Diagnosis Charcot\u2019s joints is suspected when a person with a disease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painless swelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays will show damage to the joint, and may also show abnormal bone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag- ments from previous injuries may also be visible. Treatment In the early stages of Charcot\u2019s joints, braces to sta- bilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage. When the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgery can sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten- sive, an artificial joint may be necessary. Prognosis Treatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep- tion may help to slow the damage to the joints. Prevention Preventing or effectively managing the underlying disease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage, but the condition cannot be prevented. Resources BOOKS Resnick, Donald.

Diabetes can also develop as a result of pancreatic disease, alcoholism , malnutrition , or other severe ill- nesses that stress the body. Causes and symptoms Causes The causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev- er, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factors passed on in families) and environmental factors involved. Research has shown that some people who develop diabetes have common genetic markers. In Type I diabetes, the immune system, the body\u2019s defense sys- tem against infection, is believed to be triggered by a virus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age, obesity, and family history of diabetes play a roll. In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to the insulin produced and it may not work as effectively. Symptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually that a person may not know that they have it. Early signs are lethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Other symptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow wound healing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurred vision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect- ed while a patient is seeing a doctor about another health concern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag- nosed diabetes. Individuals who are at high risk of developing Type II diabetes mellitus include people who: \u2022 are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body weight) \u2022 have a relative with diabetes mellitus \u2022 belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer- ican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian) \u2022 have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have delivered a baby weighing more than 9 lbs (4 kg) \u2022 have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above) \u2022 have a high density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than or equal to 35 mg/dL and/or a triglyceride level greater than or equal to 250 mg/dL \u2022 have had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fast- ing glucose on previous testing Several common medications can impair the body\u2019s use of insulin, causing a condition known as secondary diabetes. These medications include treatments for high blood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide diuretics ), drugs with hormonal activity ( oral contra- ceptives , thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti- corids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin. Several drugs that are used to treat mood disorders (such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose absorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car- bonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and adrenergic agonists. Other medications that can cause diabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid, cimetidine, and heparin. Symptoms Symptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over days or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles- cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in overweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp- toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination, excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss. Ketoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or uncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes. Ketones are acid compounds that form in the blood when the body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, extreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci- dosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated, this condition can lead to coma and death. With Type II diabetes, the condition may not become evident until the patient presents for medical treatment for some other condition. A patient may have heart disease, chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract, blurred vision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-healing wounds. Women may experience genital itching.

Maureen Haggerty Diabetic ketoacidosis Definition Diabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which the chemical balance of the body becomes far too acidic. Description Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a severe insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret- ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels when they become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the disease resulting from the inability of the body to produce or respond properly to insulin, required by the body to convert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKA complications represent the leading cause of death , mostly due to the accumulation of abnormally large amounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA combines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean- ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone- mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by the body; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has become too acidic. Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi- tions: the body glucose goes largely unused since most cells are unable to transport glucose into the cell without the presence of insulin; this condition makes the body use stored fat as an alternative source instead of the unavailable glucose for energy, a process that produces acidic ketones, which build up because they require insulin to be broken down. The presence of excess ketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood to become more acidic than the body tissues, which creates a toxic condition. Causes and symptoms DKA is most commonly seen in individuals with type I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usually caused by the interruption of their insulin treatment or by acute infection or trauma. A small number of people with type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, but this is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro- duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in type II patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in food intake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper- glycemia. Some common DKA symptoms include: \u2022 high blood sugar levels \u2022 frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst \u2022 fatigue and lethargy \u2022 nausea \u2022 vomiting \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 fruity odor to breath \u2022 rapid, deep breathing \u2022 muscle stiffness or aching \u2022 coma Diagnosis Diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper- glycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab- lished if the patient\u2019s urine or blood is strongly positive for glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non- diabetic person on average range from 80\u2013110 mg/dl. A person with diabetes will typically fluctuate outside those parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dl and can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon- ate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present, indicative of acidosis. A blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Test strips are available to patients commercially can sub- merge in urine to detect the presence or concentration of ketones. Treatment Ketoacidosis is treated under medical supervision and usually in a hospital setting. Basic treatment includes: \u2022 administering insulin to correct the hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1055 Diabetic ketoacidosis",

Description CMT is named for the three neurologists who first described the condition in the late 1800s. It is also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and is some- times called peroneal muscular atrophy, referring to the muscles in the leg that are often affected. The age of onset of CMT can vary anywhere from young childhood to the 50s or 60s. Symptoms typically begin by the age of 20. For reasons yet unknown, the severity in symptoms can also vary greatly, even among members of the same family. Although CMT has been described for many years, it is only since the early 1990s that the genetic cause of many of the types of CMT have become known. There- fore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramatically within a short time. The peripheral nerves CMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of nerve cells carrying information to and from the spinal cord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carry motor commands to muscles, especially those furthest from the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As a result, the muscles connected to these nerves eventually weaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carry information from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo- ple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp- toms such as not being able to tell if something is hot or cold or difficulties with balance. There are two parts of the nerve that can be affected in CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, in which the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu- lation surrounding it is the myelin sheath. The job of the myelin is to help messages travel very fast through the nerves. CMT is usually classified depending on which part of the nerve is affected. People who have problems with the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who have abnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2. Specialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con- duction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine if a person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure the speed at which messages travel through the nerves. In CMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2 the messages travel at the normal speed. Demographics CMT has been diagnosed in people from all over the world. It occurs in approximately one in 2,500 people, which is about the same incidence as multiple sclerosis. It is the most common type of inherited neurologic condition. Signs and symptoms CMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one of a number of genes that carry the instructions to make the peripheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for how the body grows and develops before and after a person is born. There are probably at least 15 different genes that can cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many have not yet been identified. CMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub- types based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub- types are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B, etc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causes CMT1A is different from that that causes CMT1B. Types of CMT CMT1A. The most common type of CMT is called CMT1A. It is caused by a mutation in a gene called peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) located on chro- mosome 17. The job of this gene is to make a protein (PMP22) that makes up part of the myelin. In most people who have CMT, the mutation that causes the condition is a duplication (doubling) of the PMP22 gene. Instead of having two copies of the PMP22 gene (one on each chro- mosome) there are three copies. It is not known how this extra copy of the PMP22 gene causes the observed symp- toms. A small percentage of people with CMT1A do not have a duplication of the PMP22 gene, but rather have a point mutation in the gene. A point mutation is like a typo in the gene that causes it to work incorrectly. HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO PRES- SURE PALSIES (HNPP). HNPP is a condition that is also caused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene. The mutation is a deletion. Therefore, there is only one copy of the PMP22 gene instead of two. People who have HNPP may have some of the signs of CMT. However, they also have episodes where they develop weakness and prob- lems with sensation after compression of certain pressure points such as the elbows or knee. Often these symptoms will resolve after a few days or weeks, but sometimes they are permanent. CMT1B. Another type of CMT, called CMT1B, is caused by a mutation in a gene called myelin protein zero (MPZ) located on chromosome 1. The job of this gene is to make the layers of myelin stick together as they are wrapped around the axon. The mutations in this gene are point mutations because they involve a change (either deletion, substitution, or insertion) at one specific com- ponent of a gene.

          "content": "Regular insulin is fast-acting and starts to work within 15\u201330 minutes, with its peak glucose-lowering effect about two hours after it is injected. Its effects last for about four to six hours. NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) and Lente insulin are intermediate-acting, starting to work within one to three hours and lasting up to 18\u201326 hours. Ultra-lente is a long-acting form of insulin that starts to work within four to eight hours and lasts 28\u201336 hours. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be caused by too much insulin, too little food (or eating too late to coincide with the action of the insulin), alcohol con- sumption, or increased exercise. A patient with symp- toms of hypoglycemia may be hungry, cranky, confused, and tired. The patient may become sweaty and shaky. Left untreated, the patient can lose consciousness or have a seizure. This condition is sometimes called an insulin reaction and should be treated by giving the patient something sweet to eat or drink like a candy, sugar cubes, juice, or another high sugar snack. Surgery Transplantation of a healthy pancreas into a diabetic patient is a successful treatment, however, this transplant is usually done only if a kidney transplant is performed at the same time. Although a pancreas transplant is possi- ble, it is not clear if the potential benefits outweigh the risks of the surgery and drug therapy needed. Alternative treatment Since diabetes can be life-threatening if not properly managed, patients should not attempt to treat this condi- tion without medicial supervision. A variety of alterna- tive therapies can be helpful in managing the symptoms of diabetes and supporting patients with the disease. Acupuncture can help relieve the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy by stimulation of cetain points. A qualified practitioner should be consulted. Herbal reme- dies may also be helpful in managing diabetes. Although there is no herbal substitute for insulin, some herbs may help adjust blood sugar levels or manage other diabetic symptoms. Some options include: \u2022 fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ) has been shown in some studies to reduce blood insulin and glu- cose levels while also lowering cholesterol \u2022 bilberry ( Vaccinium myrtillus ) may lower blood glu- cose levels, as well as helping to maintain healthy blood vessels \u2022 garlic (Allium sativum) may lower blood sugar and cho- lesterol levels \u2022 onions ( Allium cepa ) may help lower blood glucose levels by freeing insulin to metabolize it \u2022 cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens) can help relieve pain in the peripheral nerves (a type of diabetic neu- ropathy) \u2022 ginkgo (Gingko biloba) may maintain blood flow to the retina, helping to prevent diabetic retinopathy Any therapy that lowers stress levels can also be use- ful in treating diabetes by helping to reduce insulin requirements. Among the alternative treatments that aim to lower stress are hypnotherapy , biofeedback , and meditation. Prognosis Uncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of blind- ness, end-stage renal disease, and limb amputations. It also doubles the risks of heart disease and increases the risk of stroke. Eye problems including cataracts , glau- coma, and diabetic retinopathy are also more common in diabetics. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition where nerve endings, particularly in the legs and feet become less sensitive. Diabetic foot ulcers are a partic- ular problem since the patient does not feel the pain of a blister, callous, or other minor injury. Poor blood cir- culation in the legs and feet contribute to delayed wound healing. The inability to sense pain along with the complications of delayed wound healing can result in minor injuries, blisters, or callouses becoming infected and difficult to treat. In cases of severe infec- tion, the infected tissue begins to break down and rot away. The most serious consequence of this condition is the need for amputation of toes, feet, or legs due to severe infection. Heart disease and kidney disease are common com- plications of diabetes. Long-term complications may include the need for kidney dialysis or a kidney trans- plant due to kidney failure. Babies born to diabetic mothers have an increased risk of birth defects and distress at birth. Prevention Research continues on ways to prevent diabetes and to detect those at risk for developing diabetes. While the onset of Type I diabetes is unpredictable, the risk of developing Type II diabetes can be reduced by maintain- ing ideal weight and exercising regularly. The physical and emotional stress of surgery, illness, pregnancy, and alcoholism can increase the risks of diabetes, so main- taining a healthy lifestyle is critical to preventing the onset of Type II diabetes and preventing further compli- cations of the disease.

There is no cure for the permanent nerve damage caused by neuropathy. To help control pain, the choice of proven drug therapies has broadened during the past decade. Pain medication, such as the topical skin cream capsaicin, is usually no stronger than codeine because of the potential for addiction with long-term use of such drugs. Four main classes of drugs are available for pain management, alone or in combination: tricyclic antide- pressants (Imipramine, Nortriptyline), narcotic anal- gesics (Morphine), anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Gabapentin), and antiarrhythmics. KEY TERMS Central nervous system (CNS) \u2014Part of the ner- vous system consisting of the brain, cranial nerves, and spinal cord. The brain is the center of higher processes, such as thought and emotion, and is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of informa- tion from the senses.

PNS nerves link the central nervous system with sensory organs, muscles, blood vessels, and glands. Prognosis Early stage diabetic neuropathy can usually be reversed with good glucose control. Once nerve damage has occurred it cannot be reversed. The prognosis is largely dependent on the management of the underlying condition, diabetes, which may halt the progression of the neuropathy and improve symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, is slow. Prevention Tight glucose control and the avoidance of alcohol and cigarettes help protect nerves from damage. Resources BOOKS Saudek, Christopher D., Richard R. Rubin, and Cynthia S. Shump.

Urine tests can also detect ketones and protein in the urine that may help diagnose diabetes and assess how well the kidneys are functioning. These tests can also be used to monitor the disease once the patient is on a standardized diet, oral medications, or insulin. Urine tests Clinistix and Diastix are paper strips or dipsticks that change color when dipped in urine. The test strip is compared to a chart which shows the amount of glucose in the urine based on the change in color. The level of glucose in the urine lags behind the level of glucose in the blood. Testing the urine with a test stick, paper strip, or tablet that changes color when sugar is present is not as accurate as blood testing, however it can give a fast and simple reading. Ketones in the urine can be detected using similar types of dipstick tests (Acetest or Ketostix). Ketoacidosis can be a life-threatening situation in Type I diabetics, so having a quick and simple test to detect ketones can assist in establishing a diagnosis sooner. Another dipstick test can determine the presence of protein or albumin in the urine. Protein in the urine can KEY TERMS Cataracts \u2014A condition where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy\u2014A condition where the sensitivity of nerves to pain, temperature, and pressure is dulled particularly in the legs and feet.

Glaucoma\u2014A condition where pressure within the eye causes damage to the optic nerve, which sends visual images to the brain. Hyperglycemia \u2014A condition where there is too much glucose or sugar in the blood. Hypoglycemia\u2014A condition where there is too lit- tle glucose or sugar in the blood.

Ketoacidosis \u2014A condition due to starvation or uncontrolled Type I diabetes. Ketones are acid com- pounds that form in the blood when the body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, extreme tiredness, and drowsiness.

A more sensitive test for urine protein uses radioactively tagged chemicals to detect microalbuminuria, small amounts of protein in the urine, that may not show up on dipstick tests. Blood tests FASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is drawn from a vein in the patient\u2019s arm after a period at least eight hours when the patient has not eaten, usually in the morning before breakfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sam- ple and the amount of glucose is measured in the remain- ing plasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) or greater can indicate diabetes. The fasting glucose test is usually repeated on another day to confirm the results. POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is taken right after the patient has eaten a meal. ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. Blood samples are taken from a vein before and after a patient drinks a thick, sweet syrup of glucose and other sugars. In a non-diabet- ic, the level of glucose in the blood goes up immediately after the drink and then decreases gradually as insulin is used by the body to metabolize, or absorb, the sugar. In a diabetic, the glucose in the blood goes up and stays high after drinking the sweetened liquid. A plasma glucose level of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or higher at two hours after drinking the syrup and at one other point during the two-hour test period confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.

An x ray of the foot will be taken to determine whether the bone has become infected. A sample from the wound will be cul- tured to identify the organism that is causing the infec- tion so that the appropriate antibiotic can be selected. Treatment From the results of the culture, the appropriate antibiotic will be prescribed. Any dead or infected tissue will be surgically removed and, if necessary, a cast and/or special shoes may be used to protect the area. In addition, the patient will be instructed to keep off their feet. If the ulcer does not heal, the physician may per- form surgery to increase blood flow to the foot.

If a couple has had a child diagnosed with EDS the chance that they will have another child with the same disorder depends on with what form of EDS the child has been diagnosed and if either parent is affected by the same disease or not. Individuals diagnosed with an autosomal dominant form of EDS have a 50% chance of passing the same disor- der on to a child in each pregnancy. Individuals diagnosed with an autosomal recessive form of EDS have an extreme- ly low risk of having a child with the same disorder. X-linked recessive EDS is accompanied by a slight- ly more complicated pattern of inheritance. If a father with an X-linked recessive form of EDS passes a copy of his X chromosome to his children, the sons will be unaf- fected and the daughters will be carriers. If a mother is a carrier for an X-linked recessive form of EDS, she may have affected or unaffected sons, or carrier or unaffected daughters, depending on the second sex chromosome inherited from the father. Prenatal diagnosis is available for specific forms of EDS, including kyphosocliosis type and vascular type. However, prenatal testing is only a possibility in these types if the underlying defect has been found in another family member. Treatment Medical therapy relies on managing symptoms and trying to prevent further complications. There is no cure for EDS. Braces may be prescribed to stabilize joints, although surgery is sometimes necessary to repair joint damage caused by repeated dislocations. Physical therapy teaches individuals how to strengthen muscles around joints and may help to prevent or limit damage. Elective surgery is discouraged due to the high possibility of complications. Alternative treatment There are anecdotal reports that large daily doses 0.04\u20130.14 oz (1\u20134 g) of vitamin C may help decrease bruising and aid in wound healing. Constitutional home- opathic treatment may be helpful in maintaining optimal health in persons with a diagnosis of EDS. An individual with EDS should discuss these types of therapies with their doctor before beginning them on their own. Thera- py that does not require medical consultation involves protecting the skin with sunscreen and avoiding activities that place stress on the joints. Prognosis The outlook for individuals with EDS depends on the type of EDS with which they have been diagnosed. Symptoms vary in severity, even within one sub-type, and the frequency of complications changes on an indi- vidual basis. Some individuals have negligible symptoms while others are severely restricted in their daily life. Extreme joint instability and scoliosis may limit a per- son\u2019s mobility. Most individuals will have a normal lifes- pan. However, those with blood vessel involvement, par- ticularly those with EDS vascular type, have an increased risk of fatal complications. EDS is a lifelong condition. Affected individuals may face social obstacles related to their disease on a daily basis. Some people with EDS have reported living with fears of significant and painful skin ruptures, becoming pregnant (especially those with EDS vascular type), their condition worsening, becoming unemployed due to physical and emotional burdens, and social stigmatization in general. Constant bruises, skin wounds, and trips to the hos- pital take their toll on both affected children and their parents. Prior to diagnosis parents of children with EDS have found themselves under suspicion of child abuse. Some people with EDS are not diagnosed until well into adulthood and, in the case of EDS vascular type, occasionally not until after death due to complications of the disorder. Not only may the diagnosis itself be devas- tating to the family, but in many cases other family mem- bers find out for the first time they are at risk for being affected. Although individuals with EDS face significant challenges, it is important to remember that each person is unique with their own distinguished qualities and potential. Persons with EDS go on to have families, to have careers, and to be accomplished citizens, surmount- ing the challenges of their disease.

          "content": "Causes and symptoms There are numerous types of EDS, all caused by changes in one of several genes. The manner in which EDS is inherited depends on the specific gene involved. There are three patterns of inheritance for EDS: autosomal domi- nant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked (extremely rare). Chromosomes are made up of hundreds of small units known as genes, which contain the genetic material necessary for an individual to develop and function. Humans have 46 chromosomes, which are matched into 23 pairs. Because chromosomes are inherited in pairs, each individual receives two copies of each chromosome and likewise two copies of each gene. Changes or mutations in genes can cause genetic diseases in several different ways, many of which are represented within the spectrum of EDS. In autosomal dominant EDS, only one copy of a specific gene must be changed for a person to have EDS. In autosomal reces- sive EDS, both copies of a specific gene must be changed for a person to have EDS. If only one copy of an autoso- mal recessive EDS gene is changed the person is referred to as a carrier, meaning they do not have any of the signs or symptoms of the disease itself, but carry the possibili- KEY TERMS Arthrochalasia\u2014Excessive loosness of the joints.

However, this affects males and females dif- ferently because males and females have a different num- ber of X chromosomes. As of 2001 the few X-linked forms of EDS fall under the category of X-linked recessive. As with autosomal recessive, this implies that both copies of a specific gene must be changed for a person to be affected. However, because males only have one X-chromosome, they are affected if an X-linked recessive EDS gene is changed on their single X-chromosome. That is, they are affected even though they have only one changed copy. On the other hand, that same gene must be changed on both of the X-chromosomes in a female for her to be affected. Although there is much information regarding the changes in genes that cause EDS and their various inheri- tance patterns, the exact gene mutation for all types of EDS is not known.

A skin biopsy may be used to demonstrate the structurally abnormal collagen. This type of biochem- ical test identifies more than 95% of individuals with EDS vascular type. Laboratory testing is recommended for individuals with two or more of the major criteria. DNA analysis may als be used to identify the change within the COL3A1 gene. This information may be help- ful for genetic counseling purposes. Prenatal testing is available for pregnancies in which an affected parent has been identified and their DNA mutation is known or their biochemical defect has been demonstrated. Kyphoscoliosis type The major symptoms of kyphoscoliosis type, for- merly called EDS type VI, are general joint looseness. At birth, the muscle tone is poor, and motor skill develop- ment is subsequently delayed. Also, infants with this type of EDS have an abnormal curvature of the spine ( scolio- sis). The scoliosis becomes progressively worse with age, with affected individuals usually unable to walk by age 20. The eyes and skin are fragile and easily damaged, and blood vessel involvement is a possibility. The bones may also be affected as demonstrated by a decrease in bone mass. Kyphoscoliosis type is inherited in an autoso- mal recessive manner. There are four major clinical diagnostic criteria for EDS kyphoscoliosis type. These include generaly loose joints, low muscle tone at birth, scoliosis at birth (which worsens with age), and a fragility of the eyes, which may give the white area of the eye a blue tint or cause the eye to rupture. This form of EDS is caused by a change in the PLOD gene on chromosome 1, which encodes the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase. A laboratory test is available in which urinary hydroxylysyl pryridinoline is measured. This test, performed on urine is extremely senstive and specific for EDS kyphoscolios type. Laboratory testing is recommended for infants with three or more of the major diagnostic criteria. Prenatal testing is available if a pregnancy is known to be at risk and an identified affected family member has had positive laboratory testing. An amniocentesis may be performed in which fetal cells are removed from the amniotic fluid and enzyme activity is measured. Arthrochalasia type Dislocation of the hip joint typically accompanies arthrochalasia type EDS, formerly called EDS type VIIB. Other joints are also unusually loose, leading to recurrent partial and total dislocations. The skin has a high degree of stretchability and bruises easily. Individuals with this type of EDS may also experience mildly diminished bone mass, scoliosis, and poor muscle tone. Arthrochala- sia type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for EDS arthrochalasia type. These include sever general- ized joing hypermobility and bilateral hip dislocation present at birth. This form of EDS is caused by a change in either of two components of Collage type I, called proa1(I) type A and proa2(I) type B. A skin biopsy may be preformed to demonstrate an abnormality in either components. Direct DNA testing is also available. Dermatosparaxis type Individuals with this type of EDS, once called type VIIC, have extremely fragile skin that bruises easily but does not scar excessively. The skin is soft and may sag, leading to an aged appearance even in young adults. Indi- viduals may also experience hernias. Dermatosparaxis type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There are two major clinical diagnostic criteria for EDS dematosparaxis type. These include severe skin fragility and sagging or aged appearing skin. This form of EDS is caused by a change in the enzyme called procolla- gen I N-terminal peptidase. A skin biopsy may be pre- formed for a definitive diagnosis of Dermatosparaxis type. Other types There are several other forms of EDS that have not been as clearly defined as the aforementioned types. Forms of EDS within this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic diarrhea , joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patterns within this group include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive.

          "content": "Diagnosis The abnormal portion of the gene that causes FAP in most patients can be detected. A blood test can then be performed which identifies family members who have the same mutation. They will eventually develop the condi- tion. Children who have a parent with FAP, and siblings of affected patients whose parental history is incomplete, should be evaluated. The polyps characteristic of FAP have been found in children as young as age five. Testing of appropriate individuals should take place as soon as the diagnosis of FAP is established in one member of a family. Relatives of people with diagnosed FAP should exercise caution regarding where they seek advice and testing. One study of a commercially available blood test found that less than 20% of patients received any genetic counseling, and almost one third of their physicians mis- interpreted the test results. Registries for FAP patients can be found at many sites in the United States. Such a registry specializes in identification, assistance, and education of people with a particular disease, and is usually a separate department in a research hospital. A team of health professionals who have expertise in the disorder staff the registry. Testing within a research setting and/or at a facility with a registry of patients with FAP is more likely to safeguard against problems, such as the misunderstand- ing of test results. As part of a research project, some- times counseling as well as blood tests are available at no charge to the patient. Insurance coverage varies. Con- cerns about confidentiality, and future insurance and employment discrimination, may prompt individuals to pay for the examination out of pocket. Commercial blood tests cost approximately $250 per sample. If the abnormal gene is found in a family member, annual screening for colon polyps is recommended, beginning at age 11. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is used for this examination. It is usually done in a physician\u2019s office, or in a hospital department, most often by a gas- troenterologist or a surgeon. Food intake may be restrict- ed for 24 hours prior to the procedure. Before the study, the intestine is cleared of stool by one or more small ene- mas. Some physicians prefer to sedate the patient, to help them relax. Then a flexible, lighted, hollow tube (sigmoidoscope) is inserted into the anus and maneu- vered into the large intestine. The physician examines the wall of the colon to look for polyps. If polyps are found, one or more may be removed for biopsy. Most patients report little discomfort during the examination. The procedure itself takes five to fifteen minutes. The patient may be at the facility an hour, or more, if recovery from sedation is needed. If no medica- tion was administered, driving and resumption of normal activities are permitted immediately. The cost of the pro- cedure varies widely, but, as of 1997, it was covered by Medicare, indicating the likelihood of other types of insurance coverage. In some cases the portion of the gene responsible for FAP cannot be identified. Family members of these patients cannot have a predictive blood test. The current recommendation is for these patients to have the same annual examination with flexible sigmoidoscopy as patients with a diagnosed FAP gene. A noninvasive screening eye examination to detect CHRPE, associated with FAP, may also be performed. Treatment The only definitive treatment for FAP is surgical removal of the lower intestine. Since the goal is to pre- vent cancer, the operation is done as soon as adenoma- tous polyps are found on sigmoidoscopy. Waiting until a polyp becomes malignant is unsafe, as the cancer may invade surrounding tissues. There are several choices about the type of surgery to treat this condition. Some authorities advocate removal of the colon, leaving the rectum or lowest portion of the intestine in place. The small intestine can be attached to the rectum, allowing normal bowel function. This is often called ileorectal anastomosis. Others argue that this sec- tion is also liable to develop polyps, needs to be moni- tored regularly, and may require eventual removal. Excision of the entire lower intestine with preserva- tion of normal bowel function is possible. This entails a more complex surgical procedure. The patient may expe- rience more complications and a longer recovery period. However, the risk of polyp development in this area is very low. Periodic examination of the intestine may not be needed once healing is complete. The more intricate surgery may be referred to as a J- pouch procedure, an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, a restorative proctocolectomy, or an ileoanal reservoir proce- dure. It involves creating a \u201cpouch\u201d of tissue from the small intestine, which is attached to the anus. This serves as a reservoir or holding area for stool, much as the rectum does normally. The surgery is often done in several stages. A temporary ileostomy, which creates an opening of the small intestines onto the abdomen, is required. When all proce- dures are completed, and after a recuperation period, the patient regains normal bowel function through the anus. Some researchers suggest that as genetic testing becomes more developed, the specific portion of the gene involved may dictate the type of surgery chosen.

          "content": "repeats present; the higher the number of repeats, the greater the chance that the premutation will expand to a full mutation in the next generation. All mothers of a child with a full mutation are carriers of an FMR-1 gene expan- sion. Ninety-nine percent of patients with fragile X syn- drome have a CGG expansion, and less than one percent have a point mutation or deletion on the FMR1 gene. Individuals with fragile X syndrome appear normal at birth but their development is delayed. Most boys with fragile X syndrome have mental impairment. The severi- ty of mental impairment ranges from learning disabilities to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems include attention deficit and hyperactivity at a young age. Some may show aggressive behavior in adulthood. Short attention span, poor eye contact, delayed and disordered speech and language, emotional instability, and unusual hand mannerisms (hand flapping or hand biting) are also seen frequently. Characteristic physical traits appear later in childhood. These traits include a long and narrow face, prominent jaw, large ears, and enlarged testes. In females who carry a full mutation, the physical and behavioral features and mental retardation tend to be less severe. About 50% of females who have a full mutation are men- tally retarded. Other behavioral characteristics include whirling, spinning, and occasionally autism. Children with fragile X syndrome often have fre- quent ear and sinus infections. Nearsightedness and lazy eye are also common. Many babies with fragile X syn- drome may have trouble with sucking and some experi- ence digestive disorders that cause frequent gagging and vomiting. A small percentage of children with fragile X syndrome may experience seizures. Children with fragile X syndrome also tend to have loose joints which may result in joint dislocations. Some children develop a cur- vature in the spine, flat feet, and a heart condition known as mitral valve prolapse. Diagnosis Any child with signs of developmental delay of speech, language, or motor development with no known cause should be considered for fragile X testing, espe- cially if there is a family history of the condition. Behav- ioral and developmental problems may indicate fragile X syndrome, particularly if there is a family history of mental retardation. Definitive identification of the fragile X syndrome is made by means of a genetic test to assess the number of CGG sequence repeats in the FMR-1 gene. Individuals with the premutation or full mutation may be identified through genetic testing . Genetic test- ing for the fragile X mutation can be done on the devel- oping baby before birth through amniocentesis or chori- onic villus sampling (CVS), and is 99% effective in detecting the condition due to trinucleotide repeat expan- sion. Prenatal testing should only be undertaken after the fragile X carrier status of the parents has been confirmed and the couple has been counseled regarding the risks of recurrence. While prenatal testing is possible to do with CVS, the results can be difficult to interpret and addition- al testing may be required. Treatment Presently there is no cure for fragile X syndrome. Management includes such approaches as speech thera- py, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. The expertise of psychologists, special education teachers, and genetic counselors may also be beneficial. Drugs may be used to treat hyperactivity, seizures, and other problems. Establishing a regular routine, avoiding over stimulation, and using calming techniques may also help in the management of behavioral problems. Children with a troubled heart valve may need to see a heart spe- cialist and take medications before surgery or dental pro- cedures. Children with frequent ear and sinus infections may need to take medications or have special tubes placed in their ears to drain excess fluid. Mainstreaming of children with fragile X syndrome into regular class- rooms is encouraged because they do well imitating behavior. Peer tutoring and positive reinforcement are also encouraged. Prognosis Early diagnosis and intensive intervention offer the best prognosis for individuals with fragile X syndrome. Adults with fragile X syndrome may benefit from voca- tional training and may need to live in a supervised set- ting. Life span is typically normal. Resources BOOK Sutherland, Grant R., and John C.

It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants. However, cough KEY TERMS Antitussives\u2014Drugs used to suppress coughing. Expectorant\u2014Drug used to thin mucus.

The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days.

          "content": "CMTX. Another type of CMT, called CMTX, is usu- ally considered a subtype of CMT1 because it affects the myelin, but it has a different type of inheritance than type 1 or type 2. In CMTX, the CMT-causing gene is located on the X chromosome and is called connexin 32 (Cx32). The job of this gene is to code for a class of protein called connexins that form tunnels between the layers of myelin. CMT2. There are at least five different genes that can cause CMT type 2. Therefore, CMT2 has subtypes A, B, C, D and E. As of early 2001, scientists have narrowed in on the location of most of the CMT2 causing genes. However, the specific genes and the mutations have not yet been found for most types. Very recently, the gene for CMT2E has been found. The gene is called neurofila- ment-light (NF-L). Because it has just been discovered, not much is known about how mutations in this gene cause CMT. CMT3. In the past a condition called Dejerine-Sottas disease was referred to as CMT3. This is a severe type of CMT in which symptoms begin in infancy or early child- hood. It is now known that this is not a separate type of CMT and in fact people who have onset in infancy or early childhood often have mutations in the PMP22 or MPZ genes. CMT4. CMT4 is a rare type of CMT in which the nerve conduction tests have slow response results. Howev- er, it is classified differently from CMT1 because it is passed through families by a different pattern of inheri- tance. There are five different subtypes and each has only been described in a few families. The symptoms in CMT4 are often severe and other symptoms such as deafness may be present. There are three different genes that have been associated with CMT4 as of early 2001. They are called MTMR2, EGR2, and NDRG1. More research is required to understand how mutations in these genes cause CMT. Inheritance CMT1A and 1B, HNPP, and all of the subtypes of CMT2 have autosomal dominant inheritance. Autosomal refers to the first 22 pairs of chromosomes that are the same in males and females. Therefore, males and females are affected equally in these types. In a dominant condition, only one gene of a pair needs to have a muta- tion in order for a person to have symptoms of the condi- tion. Therefore, anyone who has these types has a 50%, or one in two, chance of passing CMT on to each of their children. This chance is the same for each pregnancy and does not change based on previous children. CMTX has X-linked inheritance. Since males only have one X chromosome, they only have one copy of the Cx32 gene. Thus, when a male has a mutation in his Cx32 gene, he will have CMT. However, females have two X chromosomes and therefore have two copies of the Cx32 gene. If they have a mutation in one copy of their Cx32 genes, they will only have mild to moderate symptoms of CMT that may go unnoticed. This is because their normal copy of the Cx32 gene does make normal myelin. Females pass on one or the other of their X chromo- somes to their children\u2014sons or daughters. If a woman with a Cx32 mutation passes her normal X chromosome, she will have an unaffected son or daughter who will not pass CMT on to his or her children. If the woman passes the chromosome with Cx32 mutation on she will have an affected son or daughter, although the daughter will be mildly affected or have no symptoms. Therefore, a woman with a Cx32 mutation has a 50%, or a one in two, chance of passing the mutation to her children: a son will be affected, and a daughter may only have mild symptoms. When males pass on an X chromosome, they have a daughter. When they pass on a Y chromosome, they have a son. Since the Cx32 mutation is on the X chromosome, a man with CMTX will always pass the Cx32 mutation on to his daughters. However, when he has a son, he passes on the Y chromosome, and therefore the son will not be affected. Therefore, an affected male passes the Cx32 gene mutation on to all of his daughters, but to none of his sons. CMT4 has autosomal recessive inheritance. Males and females are equally affected. In order for a person to have CMT4, they must have a mutation in both of their CMT-causing genes\u2014one inherited from each parent. The parents of an affected person are called carriers. They have one normal copy of the gene and one copy with a mutation. Carriers do not have symptoms of CMT. Two carrier parents have a 25%, or one in four, chance of passing CMT on to each of their children. The onset of symptoms is highly variable, even among members of the same family. Symptoms usually progress very slowly over a person\u2019s lifetime. The main problems caused by CMT are weakness and loss of sen- sation mainly in the feet and hands. The first symptoms are usually problems with the feet such as high arches and problems with walking and running. Tripping while walking and sprained ankles are common. Muscle loss in the feet and calves leads to \u201cfoot drop\u201d where the foot does not lift high enough off the ground when walking. Complaints of cold legs are common, as are cramps in the legs, especially after exercise. In many people, the fingers and hands eventually become affected. Muscle loss in the hands can make fine movements such as working buttons and zippers difficult. Some patients develop tremor in the upper limbs.

In addition, a blood test may reveal the presence of antibodies against the cholera bacteria. In areas where cholera occurs often, however, patients are usually treated for diarrhea and vomiting symptoms as if they had cholera without labo- ratory confirmation. Treatment The key to treating cholera lies in preventing dehy- dration by replacing the fluids and electrolytes lost through diarrhea and vomiting. The discovery that rehy- dration can be accomplished orally revolutionized the treatment of cholera and other, similar diseases by mak- ing this simple, cost-effective treatment widely available throughout the world. The World Health Organization has developed an inexpensive oral replacement fluid con- taining appropriate amounts of water, sugar, and salts that is used worldwide. In cases of severe dehydration, replacement fluids must be given intravenously. Patients should be encouraged to drink when they can keep liq- uids down and eat when their appetite returns. Recovery generally takes three to six days. Adults may be given the antibiotic tetracycline to shorten the duration of the illness and reduce fluid loss. The World Health Organization recommends this antibi- otic treatment only in cases of severe dehydration. If antibiotics are overused, the cholera bacteria organism may become resistant to the drug, making the antibiotic ineffective in treating even severe cases of cholera.

Prognosis Today, cholera is a very treatable disease. Patients with milder cases of cholera usually recover on their own in three to six days without additional complications. They may eliminate the bacteria in their feces for up to two weeks. Chronic carriers of the disease are rare. With prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement, the death rate in patients with severe cholera is less than 1%. Untreated, the death rate can be greater than 50%. The difficulty in treating severe cholera is not in knowing how to treat it, but in getting medical care to ill people in underdeveloped areas of the world where medical resources are limited. Prevention The best form of cholera prevention is to establish good sanitation and waste treatment systems. In the absence of adequate sewage treatment, the following guidelines should be followed to reduce the possibility of infection: \u2022 Boil it. Drink and brush teeth only with water that has been boiled or treated with chlorine or iodine tablets. Safe drinks include coffee and tea made with boiling water or carbonated bottled water and carbonated soft drinks. \u2022 Cook it. Eat only thoroughly cooked foods, and eat them while they are still hot. Avoid eating food from street vendors. \u2022 Peel it. Eat only fruit or nuts with a thick, intact skin or shell that is removed immediately before eating. \u2022 Forget it. Do not eat raw foods such as oysters or ceviche. Avoid salads and raw vegetables. Do not use untreated ice cubes in otherwise safe drinks. \u2022 Stay out of it. Do not swim or fish in polluted water. A cholera vaccine exists that can be given to travel- ers and residents of areas where cholera is known to be active, but the vaccine is not highly effective. It provides only 25\u201350% immunity, and then only for a period of about six months. The vaccine is never given to infants under six months of age. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not currently recom- mend cholera vaccination for travelers. Residents of cholera-plagued areas should discuss the value of the vaccine with their doctor.

Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking water contaminated with the bacteria. Although cholera was a public health problem in the United States and Europe a hundred years ago, modern sanitation and the treatment of drinking water have virtually eliminated the disease in developed countries. In third world countries, however, cholera is still common. Description Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with cholera bacteria. Conta- mination usually occurs when human feces from a per- son who has the disease seeps into a community water supply. Fruits and vegetables can also be contaminated in areas where crops are fertilized with human feces. Cholera bacteria also live in warm, brackish water and can infect persons who eat raw or undercooked seafood obtained from such waters. Cholera is rarely transmitted directly from one person to another. Cholera often occurs in outbreaks or epidemics. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that during any cholera epidemic, approximately 0.2\u20131% of the local population will contract the disease. Anyone can get cholera, but infants, children, and the elderly are more likely to die from the disease because they become dehy- drated faster than adults. There is no particular season in which cholera is more likely to occur. Because of an extensive system of sewage and water treatment in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Australia, cholera is generally not a concern for visi- tors and residents of these countries. People visiting or living in other parts of the world, particularly on the Indi- an subcontinent and in parts of Africa and South Ameri- ca, should be aware of the potential for contracting cholera and practice prevention. Fortunately, the disease is both preventable and treatable. Causes and symptoms Because V . cholerae bacteria are sensitive to acid, most cholera-causing bacteria die in the acidic environ- ment of the stomach. However, when a person has ingest- ed food or water containing large amounts of cholera bac- teria, some will survive to infect the intestines. As would be expected, antacid usage or the use of any medication that blocks acid production in the stomach would allow more bacteria to survive and cause infection. In the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying bacte- ria produce a toxin that causes a large volume of water and electrolytes to be secreted into the bowels and then to be abruptly eliminated as watery diarrhea. V omiting may also occur. Symptoms begin to appear between one and three days after the contaminated food or water has been ingested. Most cases of cholera are mild, but about one in 20 patients experience severe, potentially life-threatening symptoms. In severe cases, fluids can be lost through diarrhea and vomiting at the rate of one quart per hour. This can produce a dangerous state of dehydration unless the lost fluids and electrolytes are rapidly replaced. Signs of dehydration include intense thirst, little or no urine output, dry skin and mouth, an absence of tears, glassy or sunken eyes, muscle cramps, weakness, and rapid heart rate. The soft spot on an infant\u2019s head will appear to be sunken or drawn in. Dehydration occurs most rapidly in the very young and the very old because they have fewer fluid reserves. A doctor should be consulted immediately any time signs of severe dehydration occur. Immediate replacement of the lost fluids and electrolytes is necessary to prevent kidney failure,coma, and death.

Biopsy of an infected organ such as the intestine through an endoscope is another way to make the diagnosis. Treatment The first aim of treatment as with any severe diar- rheal illness is to avoid dehydration and malnutrition . Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or intravenous fluids are sometimes needed. Medications used to treat diarrhea by decreasing intestinal motility, such as loperamide or diphenoxylate are also useful, but should only be used with the advice of a physician. KEY TERMS Anti-motility medications \u2014Medications such as loperamide (sold as Imodium), dephenoxylate (sold as Lomotil), or medications containing codeine or narcotics that decrease the ability of the intestine to contract. This can worsen the con- dition of a patient with dysentery or colitis. Cyst\u2014A protective sac that includes either fluid or the cell of an organism. The cyst enables many organisms to survive in the environment for long periods of time without need for food or water. Immunocompromised \u2014A change or alteration of the immune system that normally serves to fight off infections other illnesses. This can involve changes in antibodies that the body produces (hygogammaglobulinemia), or a defect in the cells that partake in the immune response. Diseases such as AIDS and cancer exhibit changes in the body\u2019s natural immunity. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) \u2014A liquid preparation developed by the World Health Orga- nization that can decrease fluid loss in persons with diarrhea. Originally developed to be pre- pared with materials available in the home, com- mercial preparations have recently come into use. Parasite\u2014An organism that lives on or in another and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that organism. Protozoa \u2014Group of extremely small single cell (unicellular) or acellular organisms that are found in moist soil or water. They tend to exist as para- sites, living off other life forms. Spore\u2014A resistant form of certain species of bac- teria, protozoa, and other organisms. The use of the medication, trimethoprim-sulfameth- oxazole (Bactrim) for one week can be successful in treating intestinal infections and prevents relapse in those with a normal immune system. The same medicine can be prescribed to treat infections of both the intestine or bile ducts in immunocompromised individuals, but main- tenance or continuous treatment is often needed. Prognosis The outlook is quite good for individuals in whom a diagnosis is made. Even without treatment, symptoms usually do not last much more than a month or so except in cases with altered immunity. Fortunately, treatment is usually successful even in those patients. Prevention Aside from a waterborne source as the origin of infection, little else is known about how the parasite is transmitted. Therefore, little can be done regarding pre- vention, except to maintain proper hand washing tech- niques and hygiene.

Tish Davidson Cholestasis Definition Cholestasis is a condition caused by rapidly devel- oping (acute) or long-term (chronic) interruption in the excretion of bile (a digestive fluid that helps the body process fat). The term is taken from the Greek chole, bile, and stasis, standing still. Description Cholestasis is caused by obstruction within the liver (intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic). The obstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment bilirubin, and fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood stream instead of being eliminated normally. Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by wide- spread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such as hepatitis, that impair the body\u2019s ability to eliminate bile. Extrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect of many medications. It can also occur as a complication of surgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, or intravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can be caused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones that block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Pregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile ducts to estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the sec- ond and third trimesters of pregnancy. This condition is the second most common cause of jaundice during preg- nancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is the only symptom most women experience. Cholestasis of pregnancy tends to run in families. Symptoms usually disappear within two to four weeks after the baby\u2019s birth but may reappear if the woman becomes pregnant again. A similar condition affects some women who take birth-control pills. Symptoms disappear after the woman stops using oral contraceptives. This condition does not lead to chronic liver disease. A woman who develops cholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy or birth control hormones) has an increased risk of develop- ing cholestasis from the other. Benign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condi- tion characterized by brief, repeated episodes of itching and jaundice. Symptoms often disappear. This condition does not cause cirrhosis. Drug-induced cholestasis may be a complication of chemotherapy or other medications. The two major types of drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic injury and reactions unique to an individual (idiosyncratic reactions). In direct toxic injury, the severity of symptoms parallels the amount of medication involved. This condition: \u2022 develops a short time after treatment begins \u2022 follows a predictable pattern \u2022 usually causes liver damage Direct toxic reactions develop in 1% of all patients who take chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a tranquilizer and antinausea drug. Idiosyncratic reactions may occur at the onset of treatment or at a later time. Allergic responses are varied and are not related to the amount of medica- tion being taken. Causes and symptoms Intrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepati- tis or by medications that can produce symptoms resem- bling hepatitis. Phenothiazine-derivative drugs, including chlorpromazine, can cause sudden fever and inflamma- tion. Symptoms usually disappear after use of the drug(s) is stopped. In rare cases, a condition resembling chronic biliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized by destruction of small bile ducts) persists even after the medication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi- lar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo- lidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), and other drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be caused by alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis , cancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part of the body, and a number of rare disorders. Extrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone obstructing the passage through which bile travels from the gallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or by pancreatic cancer. Less often, the condition occurs as a result of non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures), ductal carcinoma, or disorders of the pancreas. Cholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes lit- tle, if any, inflammation. Symptoms develop gradually GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 783 Cholestasis",

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test. Examining a stool sam- ple under a microscope can help to rule out parasitic and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1205 Enterobacterial infections",

          "content": "Each person actually has two copies of each gene, including the CFTR gene, in each of their body cells. Dur- ing sperm and egg production, however, these two copies separate, so that each sperm or egg contains only one copy of each gene. When sperm and egg unite, the newly creat- ed cell once again has two copies of each gene. The two gene copies may be the same or they may be slightly different. For the CFTR gene, for instance, a person may have two normal copies, or one normal and one mutated copy, or two mutated copies. A person with two mutated copies will develop cystic fibrosis. A person with one mutated copy is said to be a carrier. A carrier will not have symptoms of CF, but can pass on the mutat- ed CFTR gene to his/her children. When two carriers have children, they have a one in four chance of having a child with CF each time they conceive. They have a two in four chance of having a child who is a carrier, and a one in four chance of having a child with two normal CFTR genes. Approximately one in every 25 Americans of north- ern-European descent is a carrier of the mutated CF gene, while only one in 17,000 African Americans and one in 30,000 Asian Americans are carriers. Since carri- ers are symptom-free, very few people will know whether or not they are carriers unless there is a family history of the disease. Two white Americans with no family history of CF have a one in 2,500 chance of hav- ing a child with CF. It may seem puzzling that a mutated gene with such harmful consequences would remain so common; one might guess that the high mortality of CF would quickly lead to loss of the mutated gene from the population. Some researchers now believe the reason for the persis- tence of the CF gene is that carriers, those with only one copy of the gene, are protected from the full effects of cholera, a microorganism that infects the intestine, caus- ing intense diarrhea and eventual death by dehydra- tion. It is believed that having one copy of the CF gene is enough to prevent the full effects of cholera infection, while not enough to cause the symptoms of CF. This so- called \u201cheterozygote advantage\u201d is seen in some other genetic disorders, including sickle-cell anemia. Symptoms The most severe effects of cystic fibrosis are seen in two body systems: the gastrointestinal (digestive) sys- tem, and the respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs. CF also affects the sweat glands and male fertility. Symptoms develop gradually, with gastrointestinal symptoms often the first to appear. GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM. Ten to fifteen percent of babies who inherit CF have meconium ileus at birth. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 985 Cystic fibrosis DOROTHY ANDERSEN, MD (1901\u20131963) Dorothy Andersen was born on May 15, 1901, in Asheville, North Carolina. She was the only child of Hans Peter Andersen and the former Mary Louise Mason. Orphaned as a young adult, Andersen put herself through Saint Johnsbury Academy and Mount Holyoke College before enrolling in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, from which she received her M.D. in 1926. Andersen turned instead to medical research as a pathologist at Babies Hospital of the Columbia-Presbyter- ian Medical Center in New York City, where she stayed for more than 20 years, eventually becoming chief of patholo- gy in 1952. Andersen is probably best known for discovery of cystic fibrosis in 1935. That discovery came about during the postmortem examination of a child who had supposed- ly died of celiac disease, a nutritional disorder. She searched for similar cases in the autopsy files and in med- ical literature, eventually realizing that she had found a dis- ease that had never been described and to which she gave the name cystic fibrosis.

Purpose The purpose of cataract surgery is to restore clear vision. It is indicated when cloudy vision due to cataracts has progressed to such an extent that it inter- feres with normal daily activities. Precautions Cataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at once. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in the event of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye is allowed to heal before the cataract is removed from the second eye. The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye problems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctors nor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since such conditions will continue to impair sight after cataract removal if they are not identified and treated, the eventu- al outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out- come of other problems. In 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can contribute to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the degeneration of the central part of the retina. According- ly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks of the loss of central vision, within four or five years, against short-term improvement. When an ARMD patient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon should shield the retina against bright light to protect it from possible light-induced damage during surgery and install an intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet and blue light, which seem to do the most damage. KEY TERMS Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) \u2014 Degeneration of the macula (the central part of the retina where the rods and cones are most dense) that leads to loss of central vision in people over 60. Cataract \u2014Progressive opacity or clouding of an eye lens, which obstructs the passage of light to the retina. Cornea\u2014Clear outer covering of the front of the eye. Intraocular lens\u2014Lens made of silicone or plastic placed within the eye; can be corrective. Retina\u2014Innermost layer at the back of the eye, which contains light receptors, the rods and cones. Description There are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular and extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal of both the lens and the thin capsule that surround them. This type of surgery was common before 1980, but has since been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removal of the capsule requires a large incision and doesn\u2019t allow comfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, people who undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have long recovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses. Extracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of the lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year in the United States, over a million cataracts are removed this way. There are two methods for extracapsular cataract surgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. A tiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made next to the cornea (the eye\u2019s outer covering), and an ultrasonic probe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces, which are then removed by suction. When the lens is too hard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will use a different extracapsular technique requiring a larger incision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made, and the whole lens (without its capsule) is removed through the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac- tion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone or plastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in about the same location as the original lens. The surgery takes about 30\u201360 minutes per eye.

Lorraine Lica, PhD Cataracts Definition A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally transparent crystalline lens of the eye. This cloudiness can cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventual blindness. Description The human eye has several parts. The outer layer of the eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped cornea and an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and sclera help protect the eye. The next layer includes the iris, pupil, and ciliary body. The iris is the colored part of the eye and the pupil is the small dark round hole in the middle of the iris. The pupil and iris allow light into the eye. The ciliary body contains muscles that help in the eye\u2019s focusing ability. The lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by a cellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent, elliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticity allows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. The lens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of Zinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules, which then change the shape of the lens. This process is called accommodation\u2014the lens focuses images to help make vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens and changes shape less easily. As a result, the accommodation process becomes more difficult, making it harder to see things up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40 and continues until about age 65. The condition is called presbyopia. It is a normal condition of aging, generally resulting in the need for reading glasses. The lens is made up of approximately 35% protein and 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes in the lens\u2019 proteins occur. Changes in the proteins, water content, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of the reasons for the formation of a cataract. The major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor- tex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of the lens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule is the outer layer. Opacities can occur in any area of the lens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to loca- tion (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular cataracts). The density and location of the cataract determines the amount of vision affected. If the cataract forms in the area of the lens directly behind the pupil, vision may be signif- icantly impaired. A cataract that occurs on the outer edges or side of the lens will create less of a visual problem. Cataracts in the elderly are so common that they are thought to be a normal part of the aging process. Between the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance of having a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 and older are affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senile or age-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes, with each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initial- ly, cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remains small or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changes may be minor. Cataracts that occur in people other than the elderly are much less common. Congenital cataracts occur very rarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection or disease in the mother during pregnancy are among the causes of congenital cataracts. Traumatic cataracts may develop after a foreign body or trauma injures the lens or eye. Systemic illnesses, such as diabetes, may result in cataracts. Cataracts can also occur secondary to other eye diseases\u2014for example, an inflammation of the inner layer of the eye (uveitis) or glaucoma. Such cataracts are called complicated cataracts. Toxic cataracts result from chemical toxicity, such as steroid use. Cataracts can also result from exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) rays. Causes and symptoms Recent studies have been conducted to try to deter- mine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an effect on the formation of cataracts in older people. The results have been mixed, with some studies finding that there is a connection and other studies finding none. Much interest has been focused on the use of antioxidant supplements as a protection against cataracts. Antioxidant vitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene help the body clean-up oxygen-free radicals. Some vitamins are marketed specifically for the eyes. Patients should speak to their doctors about the use of such vitamins. Smoking and alcohol intake have been implicated in cataract formation. Some studies have determined that a diet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataract formation, while an increase in foods rich in antioxidants will reduce the incidence. More research is needed to determine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vita- mins have any connection to the formation of cataracts. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 673 Cataracts",

A folding IOL is used when phacoemulsification is performed to accom- modate the small incision. Antibiotic drops to prevent infection and steroids to reduce inflammation are prescribed after surgery. An eye shield or glasses during the day will protect the eye from injury while it heals. During the night, an eye shield is worn. The patient returns to the doctor the day after surgery for assessment, with several follow-up visits over the next two months to monitor the healing process. Prognosis The success rate of cataract extraction is very high, with a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40 or better may be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract extraction was performed, a secondary cataract may develop in the remaining back portion of the capsule. This can occur one to two years after surgery. Y AG capsulotomy is most often used for this type of cataract. Y AG stands for yttrium alu- minum garnet, the name of the laser used for this proce- dure. This is a painless outpatient procedure and requires no incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in the remaining back part of the capsule, allowing light through. In a very small percentage (3\u20135%) of surgical cataract extractions, complications occur. Infections, swelling of the cornea (edema), bleeding, retinal detachment , and the onset of glaucoma have been reported. Some problems may occur one to two days, or even several weeks, after surgery. Any haziness, redness, decrease in vision, nausea, or pain should be reported to the surgeon immediately. Prevention Preventive measures emphasize protecting the eyes from UV radiation by wearing glasses with a special coating to protect against UV rays. Dark lenses alone are not suffi- cient. The lenses must protect against UV light (specifically, UV-A and UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some pro- tection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens pro- teins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants, includ- ing citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green leafy vegeta- bles, and/or vitamin supplements may be helpful. When tak- ing certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent eye exams may be necessary. Patients should speak to their doc- tors to see if medications may affect their eyes.

Cataract\u2014A condition of cloudiness of the lens of the eye. Cornea\u2014The transparent layer of tissue at the very front of the eye. Corticosteroids \u2014Synthetic hormones widely used to fight inflammation. Epikeratophakia\u2014A procedure in which the donor cornea is attached directly onto the host cornea. Epithelial cells\u2014Cells that form a thin surface coat- ing on the outside of a body structure. Fibrous connective tissue \u2014Dense tissue found in various parts of the body containing very few living cells. Fuchs\u2019 dystrophy\u2014A hereditary disease of the inner layer of the cornea. Treatment requires penetrating keratoplasty. The lens of the eye may also be affect- ed and require surgical replacement at the same time as the cornea. Glaucoma\u2014A vision defect caused when excessive fluid pressure within the eye damages the optic nerve. Histocompatibility antigens \u2014Proteins scattered throughout body tissues that are unique for almost every individual. Keratoconus \u2014An eye condition in which the cornea bulges outward, interfering with normal vision. Usually both eyes are affected. Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy \u2014Painful swelling of the cornea occasionally occurring after surgery to implant an artificial lens in place of a lens affected by cataract. Retinal detachment \u2014A serious vision disorder in which the light-detecting layer of cells inside the eye (retina) is separated from its normal support tis- sue and no longer functions properly. Trephine\u2014A small surgical instrument that is rotat- ed to cut a circular incision. For the first few days after surgery, the eye may feel scratchy and irritated. Vision will be somewhat blurry for as long as several months. Sutures are often left in place for six months, and occasionally for as long as two years. Risks Corneal transplants are highly successful, with over 90% of operations in United States achieving restoration of sight. However, there is always some risk associated with any surgery. Complications that can occur include infection, glaucoma, retinal detachment , cataract for- mation, and rejection of the donor cornea. Graft rejection occurs in 5\u201330% of patients, a com- plication possible with any procedure involving tissue transplantation from another person (allograft). Allograft rejection results from a reaction of the patient\u2019s immune system to the donor tissue. Cell surface proteins called histocompatibility antigens trigger this reaction. These antigens are often associated with vascular tissue (blood vessels) within the graft tissue. Since the cornea normal- ly contains no blood vessels, it experiences a very low rate of rejection. Generally, blood typing and tissue typ- ing are not needed in corneal transplants, and no close match between donor and recipient is required.

          "content": "There are several common symptoms of cataracts: \u2022 gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy vision \u2022 poor central vision \u2022 frequent changes in eyeglass prescription \u2022 changes in color vision \u2022 increased glare from lights, especially oncoming head- lights when driving at night \u2022 \u201csecond sight\u201d improvement in near vision (no longer needing reading glasses), but a decrease in distance vision \u2022 poor vision in sunlight \u2022 presence of a milky whiteness in the pupil as the cataract progresses. Diagnosis Both ophthalmologists and optometrists may detect and monitor cataract growth and prescribe prescription lenses for visual deficits. However, only an ophthalmolo- gist can perform cataract extraction. Cataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of symptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart, and by examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight into the pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of the lens even before visual symptoms have developed. An instrument called a slit lamp is basically a large micro- scope. This lets the doctor examine the front of the eye and the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor determine the location of the cataract. Some other diagnostic tests may be used to deter- mine if cataracts are present or how well the patient may potentially see after surgery. These include a glare test, potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test. Treatment For cataracts that cause no symptoms or only minor visual changes, no treatment may be necessary. Continued monitoring and assessment of the cataract is needed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist at scheduled office visits. Increased strength in prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses may be helpful. This may be all that is required if the cataract does not reduce the patient\u2019s quality of life. Cataract surgery\u2014the only option for patients whose cataracts interfere with vision to the extent of affecting their daily lives\u2014is the most frequently performed surgery in the United States. It generally improves vision in over 90% of patients. Some people have heard that a cataract should be \u201cripe\u201d before being removed. A \u201cripe\u201d or mature cataract is when the lens is completely opaque. Most cataracts are removed before they reach that stage. Some- times cataracts need to be removed so that the doctor can examine the back of the eye more carefully. This is impor- tant in patients with diseases that may affect the eye. If cataracts are present in both eyes, only one eye at a time should be operated on. Healing occurs in the first eye before the second cataract is removed, sometimes as early as the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is usu- ally given about four to six weeks after surgery. Patients will still need reading glasses. The overall health of the patient needs to be considered in making the decision to operate. However, age alone need not preclude effective surgical treatment of cataracts. People in their 90s can have successful return of vision after cataract surgery. Surgery to remove cataracts is generally an outpa- tient procedure. A local anesthetic is used and the proce- dure lasts about an hour. Removal of the cloudy lens can be done by several different procedures. The three types of cataract surgery available are: \u2022 Extracapsular cataract extraction. This type of cataract extraction is the most common. The lens and the front portion of the capsule are removed. The back part of the capsule remains, providing strength to the eye. \u2022 Intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens and the entire capsule are removed. This method carries an increased risk for detachment of the retina and swelling after surgery. It is rarely used. \u2022 Phacoemulsification. This type of extracapsular extrac- tion needs a very small incision, resulting in faster heal- ing. Ultrasonic vibration is applied to the lens to break it up into very small pieces which are then aspirated out of the eye with suction by the ophthalmologist. A replacement lens is usually inserted at the time of the surgery. A plastic artificial lens called an intraocular lens (IOL) is placed in the remaining posterior lens cap- sule of the eye.

The patient will also have a pre-operative physical exam- ination. In addition, patients start a course of antibiotic eye drops or ointment the day before surgery. Aftercare Proper post-operative care is especially important after cataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive them home after the surgery and should not bend over or do any- thing strenuous for about two weeks. They should refrain from rubbing the eye, should wear glasses to protect their eye, and should wear a shield while sleeping so the eye won\u2019t be rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient will usually continue their antibiotic for two to three weeks and will also take anti-inflammatory medication for about the same length of time. If the patient experiences inflamma- tion, redness, or pain, they should seek immediate medical treatment to avoid serious complications. Risks Cataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the time, there are no complications. Possible complications include intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central retinal inflammation (macular edema), post-operative glaucoma, retinal detachment, bleeding under the reti- na (choroidal hemorrhage), and tiny lens fragments in the back (vitreous) cavity of the eye, all of which can lead to loss of sight. Normal results Ordinarily, patients experience improved visual acu- ity and improved perception of the vividness of colors, leading to increased abilities in many activities, including reading, needlework, driving, golf, and tennis, for exam- ple.

Purpose Doppler ultrasonography can detect the direction, velocity, and turbulence of blood flow. It is frequently used to detect problems with heart valves or to measure blood flow through the arteries. Specifically, it is useful in the work up of stroke patients, in assessing blood flow in the abdomen or legs, and in viewing the heart to moni- tor carotid artery diseases. Precautions The test is widely used because it is noninvasive, uses no x rays, and gives excellent images. It is harmless, painless, and widely available. Description Doppler ultrasonography makes use of two different principles. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high- frequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it will be reflected by its target and the reflected sound can be detected back at its origin. In addition, it is known that certain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce an electrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound. The Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch increases as the source moves toward the listener and decreases as it moves away. Medical science utilizes these two principles in the following way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe) containing piezoelectric crystals sends a series of short sound pulses into the body and pauses between each pulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machine then determines the direction and depth of each returning sound and coverts this into a point of light on a television monitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed and displayed every second to produce an image of the organ being studied. The image allows the doctor to see the organ functioning in real time. The newest addition to this test is the addition of color. Adding color to the image shows the direction and rate of blood flow more clearly. During a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the technician will apply a gel to the skin, then place the transducer against the skin at various angles. The trans- ducer sends the information it receives to a television monitor that shows a moving image of the organ being studied. The technician can save these images either on video tape, paper, or x-ray film for further study. Preparation There is no special preparation needed for this test. The ultrasound technician may apply a clear gel to the skin in order to help the transducer more freely over the body. Aftercare No aftercare is necessary. Normal results A Doppler ultrasonography test showing no restrict- ed blood flow, is a normal finding.

Ultrasound is used to detect and diag- nose many eye diseases and injuries, to measure the eye prior to corrective surgery, and directly as a treat- ment tool. Purpose An ophthalmologist uses ultrasonic imaging to help diagnose the underlying cause(s) of a patient\u2019s symp- toms, to assess the general condition of an injured eye, and to measure the eye prior to corrective surgery. Situa- tions that may call for ultrasonic imaging include: \u2022 Excessive tearing or visible infection. These external symptoms could indicate a serious underlying problem such as a tumor, an internal infection, the presence of a deeply lodged irritant (foreign body), or the effects of a previously unrecognized injury. When presented with general symptoms, ultrasound can speed diagnosis if a serious condition is suspected. \u2022 Impaired vision. Fuzzy vision, poor night vision, restricted (tunnel) vision, blind spots, extreme light sensitivity, and even blindness can all stem from inner eye conditions ranging from glaucoma and cataracts, to retinitis, detached retina, tumors, or impaired blood circulation. Again, high resolution ultrasound can quickly identify causes and pinpoint their location. A special type of ultrasound, known as Doppler, can even perceive and measure circulation in the tiny blood ves- sels of the eye. \u2022 Eye trauma. The eye can be damaged by a direct impact or a puncture wound, as a result of a general head trau- ma, or by intense light exposure. Even when the cause of injury is obvious, ultrasound can reveal the exact type, extent, and location of damage, from deforma- tions and ruptures to internal bleeding, and help to guide emergency care efforts. \u2022 Lens replacement surgery. Exact measurement of the eye\u2019s optical dimensions with ultrasound greatly improves the visual outcome for cataract patients receiving permanent synthetic lenses; and for severely myopic patients receiving implanted corrective lenses. Ophthalmic ultrasound imaging is also used routine- ly to guide the precise placement of instruments during surgery, and can be used directly for the treatment of glaucoma and tumors of the eye. Precautions Ultrasound of the eye, properly performed by quali- fied personnel using appropriate equipment, has no risks. There is no evidence to suggest that the procedure itself poses any threat to a healthy eye, or worsens the condi- tion of a diseased or injured eye. Description Ophthalmic ultrasound equipment sends high fre- quency pulses of sound into the eye, where they bounce off the boundaries between different structures in the eye and produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. This echo pattern is received and interpreted by a computer to pro- duce an image on a television screen. The time it takes an echo to return to the receiver corresponds to the depth it traveled into the eye. Single transducer (the sound transmitter/receiver) ultrasound is used to measure distances within the eye. This is A-mode ultrasound.

Doppler mode ultrasound combines B-mode with the ability to detect and measure the flow of blood in the tiny vessels of the eye. As a direct treatment tool, the vibrations of high intensity A-mode ultrasound can be used to heat and erode tumors. The same technique can be used to con- trol glaucoma by selectively destroying the cells which produce the fluid that causes the internal pressure of the eye to rise. The procedure followed in a regular ultrasonic eye examination is relatively simple. The patient relaxes in a comfortable chair in a darkened room. Mild anesthetic eye drops are administered and the head is held secure. The ultrasonic probe, coated with a sterile gel to ensure good contact, is lightly pressed against the eye as the images are made. The probe may be applied to the eye- lid or directly to the eye, as necessary. The patient feels nothing else, and the whole office procedure takes about 15 minutes. Preparation Preparation by the patient is generally unnecessary, although under special circumstances an ophthalmologist may perform pretest procedures. The ophthalmologist and/or ultrasound technician will conduct all prepara- tions at the time of the test. Aftercare Patients may experience partial and temporary blurred vision, as well as \u201ceye strain\u201d headaches. These symptoms usually fade within an hour of the procedure, during which time patients should rest their eyes and avoid all activities that require good eyesight, like driving. Risks Improperly focused, high-intensity ultrasound could burn and physically disrupt delicate eye tissue and cause injury. This risk is, however, slight and would arise only from improper use, or as a potential side effect of tumor or glaucoma treatment. Normal results A normal ultrasound scan would indicate a fully healthy eye. For therapeutic ultrasound, a normal result would be an improvement in the targeted condition, such as shrinking of a tumor or lessening of pressure inside the eye of a glaucoma patient.

Howard Baker Cat-scratch fever see Cat-scratch disease Cataract surgery Definition Cataract surgery is a procedure performed to remove a cloudy lens from the eye; usually an intraocular lens is implanted at the same time. Purpose The purpose of cataract surgery is to restore clear vision. It is indicated when cloudy vision due to cataracts has progressed to such an extent that it inter- feres with normal daily activities. Precautions Cataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at once. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in the event of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye is allowed to heal before the cataract is removed from the second eye. The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye problems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctors nor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since such conditions will continue to impair sight after cataract removal if they are not identified and treated, the eventu- al outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out- come of other problems. In 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can contribute to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the degeneration of the central part of the retina. According- ly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks of the loss of central vision, within four or five years, against short-term improvement. When an ARMD patient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon should shield the retina against bright light to protect it from possible light-induced damage during surgery and install an intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet and blue light, which seem to do the most damage. KEY TERMS Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) \u2014 Degeneration of the macula (the central part of the retina where the rods and cones are most dense) that leads to loss of central vision in people over 60. Cataract \u2014Progressive opacity or clouding of an eye lens, which obstructs the passage of light to the retina. Cornea\u2014Clear outer covering of the front of the eye. Intraocular lens\u2014Lens made of silicone or plastic placed within the eye; can be corrective. Retina\u2014Innermost layer at the back of the eye, which contains light receptors, the rods and cones. Description There are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular and extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal of both the lens and the thin capsule that surround them. This type of surgery was common before 1980, but has since been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removal of the capsule requires a large incision and doesn\u2019t allow comfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, people who undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have long recovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses. Extracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of the lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year in the United States, over a million cataracts are removed this way. There are two methods for extracapsular cataract surgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. A tiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made next to the cornea (the eye\u2019s outer covering), and an ultrasonic probe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces, which are then removed by suction. When the lens is too hard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will use a different extracapsular technique requiring a larger incision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made, and the whole lens (without its capsule) is removed through the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac- tion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone or plastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in about the same location as the original lens. The surgery takes about 30\u201360 minutes per eye.

The test is designed to not be influenced by verbal ability, cultural climate, or educa- tional level. Purpose The purpose of a culture-fair test is to eliminate any social or cultural advantages, or disadvantages, that a person may have due to their upbringing. The test can be administered to anyone, from any nation, speaking any language. A culture-fair test may help identify learning or emotional problems. The duration of the test varies for the individual types of tests available, but the time is approximately between 12\u201318 minutes per section (a test usually has two to four sections). A culture-fair test is often administered by employ- ers in order to determine the best location for new employees in a large company. The wide variety of cul- ture-fair tests availiable allows the administrator to select which area is most vital, whether it be general intelligence, knowledge of a specific area, or emotional stability. Precautions There is doubt as to whether any test can truly be culturally unbiased or can ever be made completely fair to all persons independent of culture. There are no other precautions.

The pressure readings that are lower, other than those which are produced as a result of shock, typically are not significant. An ejection fraction, or a comparison of how much blood is ejected from the heart\u2019s left ventricle during its contraction phase with a measurement of blood remain- ing at the end of the left ventricle\u2019s relaxation phase, is also determined by performing a catheterization. The cardiologist will look for a normal ejection fraction read- ing of 60\u201370%. Abnormal results Cardiac catheterization provides valuable still and motion x-ray pictures of the coronary arteries that help in diagnosing coronary artery disease, poor heart function, disease of the heart valves, and septal defects (a defect in the septum, the wall that separates two heart chambers). The most prominent sign of coronary artery disease is the narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries, with narrowing that is greater than 70% considered sig- nificant. A clear indication for intervention (by angio- plasty or surgery) is a finding of significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and/or blockage or severe narrowing in the high, left anterior descending coronary artery. KEY TERMS Aneurysm\u2014An abnormal dilatation of a blood ves- sel, usually an artery. It can be caused by a congeni- tal defect or weakness in the vessel\u2019s wall. Angiography\u2014In cardiac catheterization, a picture of the heart and coronary arteries is seen after injecting a radiopaque substance (often referred to as a dye) throughout the veins and arteries. Angioplasty \u2014An alternative to vascular surgery, a balloon catheter is used to mechanically dilate the affected area of the artery and enlarge the constrict- ed or narrowed segment. Aortic valve \u2014The valve between the heart\u2019s left ventricle and ascending aorta that prevents regurgi- tation of blood back into the left ventricle. Catheter\u2014A tube made of elastic, elastic web, rub- ber, glass, metal, or plastic used to evacuate or inject fluids into the body. In cardiac catheterization, a long, fine catheter is used for passage through a blood vessel into the chambers of the heart. Coronary bypass surgery \u2014A surgical procedure which places a shunt to allow blood to travel from the aorta to a branch of the coronary artery at a point past an obstruction. Left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) \u2014 One of the heart\u2019s coronary artery branches from the left main coronary artery which supplies blood to the left ventricle. Mitral valve\u2014The bicuspid valve which is between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart. Pulmonary valve \u2014The heart valve which is posi- tioned between the right ventricle and the opening into the pulmonary artery. Shunt\u2014A passageway (or an artificially created pas- sageway) that diverts blood flow from one main route to another. Tricuspid valve\u2014The right atrioventricular valve of the heart. A finding of impaired wall motion is an additional indicator of coronary artery disease, aneurysm, an enlarged heart, or a congenital heart problem. Using the findings from an ejection fraction test which measures wall motion, cardiologists look at an ejection fraction reading under 35% as increasing the risk of complica- tions while also decreasing a successful long term or short term outcome with surgery. Detecting the difference in pressure above and below the heart valve can verify heart valve disease. The greater narrowing correlates with the higher pressure dif- ference. To confirm septal defects, a catheterization measures oxygen content on both the left and right sides of the heart. The right heart pumps unoxygenated blood to the lungs, and the left heart pumps blood that contains oxy- gen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Right side ele- vated oxygen levels indicate left-to-right atrial or ven- tricular shunt . A left side that experiences decreased oxygen indicates a right-to-left shunt. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J.

It is usually performed in a hospital\u2019s nuclear medicine department. Each scan takes 30\u201360 minutes. Coronary angiography is the most accurate method for making a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but it is also the most invasive. It is a form of cardiac catheterization that shows the heart\u2019s chambers, great vessels, and coronary arteries using x-ray technology. During coronary angiography the patient is awake but sedated. ECG electrodes are placed on the patient\u2019s chest and an intravenous line is inserted. A local anesthetic is injected into the site where the catheter will be inserted. The cardiologist inserts a catheter into a blood vessel and guides it into the heart. A contrast dye is injected to make the heart visible on x-ray cinematography. Coronary angiography is performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory either in an outpatient or inpatient surgery unit. It takes from 30 minutes to two hours. Treatment Coronary artery disease can be treated many ways. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Treatments include lifestyle changes and drug therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplas- ty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery disease is a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. Angioplasty or bypass surgery is not a \u201ccure.\u201d People with less severe coronary artery disease may gain adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent dis- ease progression\u2014a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, weight loss if needed, exercise, and not smoking\u2014also help pre- vent the disease from developing. These lifestyle changes are discussed in more detail under prevention. Drugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium- channel blockers relieve chest pain and complications of coronary artery disease, but they cannot clear blocked arteries. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) improve blood flow to the heart. Beta-blockers (acebutelol, propranolol) reduce the amount of oxygen required by the heart during stress. One type of calcium-channel blocker (verapamil, dilti- azem hydrochloride) helps keep the arteries open and reduces blood pressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots from forming on plaques, reducing the likelihood of a heart attack. Cholesterol-lowering medications are also indicated in most cases. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery are procedures that enter the body (inva- sive procedures) to improve blood flow in the coronary arteries. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, KEY TERMS Atherosclerosis \u2014A process in which the walls of the coronary arteries thicken due to the accumula- tion of plaque in the blood vessels. Atherosclerosis is the cause of coronary artery disease. Angina\u2014Chest pain that happens when diseased blood vessels restrict the flow of blood to the heart. Angina is often the first symptom of coro- nary artery disease. Beta-blocker \u2014A drug that blocks some of the effects of fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline (epi- nephrine and norepinephrine), slowing the heart rate and lowering the blood pressure. Calcium-channel blocker\u2014A drug that blocks the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of small blood vessels (arterioles) and keeps them from narrowing. Coronary arteries\u2014The main arteries that provide blood to the heart. The coronary arteries surround the heart like a crown, coming out of the aorta, arching down over the top of the heart, and divid- ing into two branches. These are the arteries in which coronary artery disease occurs. HDL cholesterol \u2014High-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol is a component of cholesterol that helps protect against heart disease. HDL is nicknamed \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol LDL Cholesterol\u2014Low-density lipoprotein choles- terol is the primary cholesterol molecule. High levels of LDL increase the risk of coronary heart disease. LDL is nicknamed \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. Plaque\u2014A deposit of fatty and other substances that accumulate in the lining of the artery wall. Triglyceride \u2014A fat that comes from food or is made from other energy sources in the body. Ele- vated triglyceride levels contribute to the develop- ment of atherosclerosis. usually called coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure. A catheter tipped with a balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh into the blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compressing the plaque to enlarge the blood vessel and open the blocked artery. The balloon is deflated, and the catheter is removed.

Left-sided heart catheterization is performed by way of a catheter through an artery which tests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function of the mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle. Purpose The primary reason for conducting a cardiac catheterization is to diagnose and manage persons known or suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con- dition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually in the United States. Symptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform- ing this procedure include: \u2022 chest pain, characterized by prolonged heavy pressure or a squeezing pain \u2022 abnormal treadmill stress test \u2022 myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack \u2022 congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi- nated from birth \u2022 a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease \u2022 a need to measure the heart muscle\u2019s ability to pump blood Typically performed along with angiography, a tech- nique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outline the heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the visualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalities in the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi- ologist may assess the patient\u2019s need and readiness for coronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasive approach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either surgically or with the use of a balloon (angioplasty). When looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro- scopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to be assessed: \u2022 enlargement of the left ventricle \u2022 ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood vessel) \u2022 narrowing of the aortic valve \u2022 insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve \u2022 the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the other due to septal defects (also known as shunting) Precautions Cardiac catheterization is categorized as an \u201cinva- sive\u201d procedure which involves the heart, its valves, and coronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm or leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important to evaluate for the following conditions before considering this procedure: \u2022 A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func- tion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi- tions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro- cedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure. \u2022 A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected, antibiotics may be given before the test to prevent inflammation of the membrane which lines the heart (endocarditis). Description To understand how a cardiac catheterization is able to diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work- ings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just as the body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in its everyday functions, so does the heart. The heart is made up of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter- ies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy- gen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality in any of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart\u2019s function. These abnormalities cause the heart\u2019s blood flow to decrease and result in the condition known as coronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency. Catheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and treating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of fluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may resemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the veins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can monitor a body\u2019s various functions at each moment. Generally a test that lasts two to three hours, a patient should expect the following prior to and during the catheterization procedure: \u2022 A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient to relax but remain conscious during the test. \u2022 An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to administer medication. Electrodes will be attached to the chest to enable the painless procedure known as an electrocardiograph. \u2022 Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by injecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is injected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quick stinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced as the catheter travels through the blood vessel. \u2022 After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery system, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is injected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 656 Cardiac catheterization",

Purpose Heart attack survivors, bypass and angioplasty patients, and individuals with angina, congestive heart failure, and heart transplants are all candidates for a car- diac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabilitation is pre- scribed to control symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, and improve the overall quality of life in these patients. Precautions A cardiac rehabilitation program should be imple- mented and closely monitored by a trained team of healthcare professionals. Description Cardiac rehabilitation is overseen by a specialized team of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare profession- als. Members of the cardiac rehabilitation team may include a dietician or nutritionist, physical therapist, exercise physiologist, psychologist, vocational coun- selor, occupational therapist, and social worker. The pro- gram frequently begins in a hospital setting and contin- ues on an outpatient basis after the patient is discharged over a period of six to 12 months. Components of a cardiac rehabilitation program vary by individual clinical need, and each program will be carefully constructed for the patient by his or her reha- bilitation team. \u2022 Exercise. Exercise programs typically start out slowly, with simple range-of-motion arm and leg exercises. Walking and stair climbing soon follow.

Patients with advanced coronary disease may require continuous ECG monitoring throughout their exercise sessions. Once discharged from the hospital, the patient works with his cardiac team to create an individual exercise plan. \u2022 Diet. Cardiac patients will work with a nutritionist or dietician to develop a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet plan. Patients with high blood pressure may be put on a salt-restricted diet and instructed to limit alcohol intake. Weight loss may also be a goal with obese car- diac patients. \u2022 Counseling. A psychologist or social worker can help cardiac patients with issues that may be contributing to their heart condition, such as stress and anxiety. Relax- ation techniques may be taught to patients to help them deal with these feelings. Cardiac patients frequently experience a period of depression, and group or indi- vidual counseling can be beneficial in overcoming these feelings. V ocational counselors can assist cardiac patients in returning to the workforce. \u2022 Education. The patient and family should be fully edu- cated on the physical limitations of the patient, his rec- ommended diet and exercise plan, his emotional status, and the lifestyle changes required to improve the patient\u2019s overall health. \u2022 Smoking cessation. Cardiac patients who smoke are twice as likely to have a heart attack in the following five years than non-smoking patients. These patients are strongly encouraged to enroll in a smoking cessa- tion program, which typically includes patient educa- tion and behavioral counseling. Nicotine replacement therapy, which uses nicotine patches, nose spray, or gum to wean patients off of cigarettes, may also be part of the program.

Patients who successfully complete the program will ideally reach an age-appropriate level of physical activity and be able to return to the workforce and/or other daily activities.

Description The heart is surrounded by a sac called the pericardi- um. When this sac becomes filled with fluid, the liquid presses on the heart, preventing the lower chambers of the heart from properly filling with blood.

          "content": "high cholesterol, or diabetes, high blood pressure rais- es the risk of heart attack or stroke several times. \u2022 Lack of physical activity\u2014Lack of exercise increases the risk of coronary artery disease. Even modest physi- cal activity, like walking, is beneficial if done regularly. \u2022 Diabetes mellitus\u2014The risk of developing coronary artery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. More than 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart or blood vessel disease. Contributing risk factors Contributing risk factors have been linked to coro- nary artery disease, but their significance is not known yet. Contributing risk factors are: \u2022 Obesity\u2014Excess weight increases the strain on the heart and increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease even if no other risk factors are present. Obesity increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol and can lead to diabetes. \u2022 Stress and anger\u2014Some scientists believe that stress and anger can contribute to the development of coro- nary artery disease and increase the blood\u2019s tendency to form clots (thrombosis). Stress, the mental and physical reaction to life\u2019s irritations and challenges, increases the heart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lin- ing of the arteries. Evidence shows that anger increases the risk of dying from heart disease. The risk of heart attack is more than double after an episode of anger. Chest pain (angina) is the main symptom of coro- nary heart disease but it is not always present. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, chest heaviness, tightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeezing, or pres- sure either behind the breastbone or in the arms, neck, or jaws. Many people have no symptoms of coronary artery disease before having a heart attack; 63% of women and 48% of men who died suddenly of coronary artery dis- ease had no previous symptoms of the disease, according to the American Heart Association. Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a visit to the physician, who will take a medical history, discuss symptoms, listen to the heart, and perform basic screening tests. These tests will measure weight, blood pressure, blood lipid levels, and fasting blood glucose levels. Other diagnostic tests include resting and exercise electrocardiogram, echocar- diography, radionuclide scans, and coronary angiogra- phy. The treadmill exercise (stress) test is an appropriate screening test for those with high risk factors even when they feel well. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart\u2019s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient\u2019s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of the heart\u2019s activity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) to a recorder that traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physician\u2019s office. A definite diagnosis cannot be made from electrocardiog- raphy. About 50% of patients with significant coronary artery disease have normal resting electrocardiograms. Another type of electrocardiogram, known as the exer- cise stress test , measures how the heart and blood ves- sels respond to exertion when the patient is exercising on a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physician\u2019s office or an exercise laboratory. It takes 15\u201330 minutes. It is not perfectly accurate. It sometimes gives a normal reading when the patient has a heart prob- lem or an abnormal reading when the patient does not. If the electrocardiogram reveals a problem or is inconclusive, the next step is exercise echocardiography or nuclear scanning (angiography). Echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, uses sound waves to create an image of the heart\u2019s chambers and valves. A technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer, then presses it against the patient\u2019s chest. The heart\u2019s sound waves are converted into an image that can be displayed on a monitor. It does not reveal the coronary arteries themselves, but can detect abnormalities in heart wall motion caused by coro- nary disease. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diag- nostic laboratory, the test takes 30\u201360 minutes. Radionuclide angiography enables physicians to see the blood flow of the coronary arteries. Nuclear scans are performed by injecting a small amount of radiopharma- ceutical such as thallium into the bloodstream. A device that uses gamma rays to produce an image of the radioac- tive material (gamma camera) records pictures of the heart. Radionuclide scans are not dangerous. The radia- tion exposure is about the same as that in a chest x ray. The tiny amount of radioactive material used disappears from the body in a few days. Radionuclide scans cost about four times as much as exercise stress tests but pro- vide more information. In radionuclide angiography, a scanning camera passes back and forth over the patient who lies on a table. Radionuclide angiography is usually performed in a hos- pital\u2019s nuclear medicine department and takes 30\u201360 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done in conjunc- tion with an exercise stress test. When the stress test is finished, thallium or sestamibi is injected. The patient resumes exercise for one minute to absorb the thallium. For patients who cannot exercise, cardiac blood flow and heart rate may be increased by intravenous dipyridamole (Persantine) or adenosine.

Lori De Milto Coronary disease see Coronary artery disease Coronary heart disease see Coronary artery disease Coronary stenting Definition A coronary stent is an artificial support device used in the coronary artery to keep the vessel open. Purpose The coronary stent is a relatively new tool used to keep coronary arteries expanded, usually following a bal- loon angioplasty. Balloon angioplasty is used in patients with coronary artery disease . In this disease, the blood vessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens, the oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. The primary cause of coronary artery disease is fat deposits blocking the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). In many cases, balloon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closes after the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup- port, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the need for coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain- less steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed inside an artery, the device comes in various sizes to match the size of the artery. Precautions Any foreign object in the body, like a stent, will increase the risk of thrombosis. Anticlotting medication is given to prevent this complication. Description Coronary stenting usually follows balloon angio- plasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter into the femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheter is positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro- nary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, and is then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded into the artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal- loon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronary artery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent against the walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter is removed, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronary artery open. A cardiac angiography will follow to insure that the stent is keeping the artery open. Alternative procedures Balloon angioplasty and coronary stenting are per- formed to relieve the symptoms of coronary artery disease. By the time coronary artery disease progresses and requires balloon angioplasty, there is no alternative to bal- loon angioplasty other than coronary bypass surgery. Coronary bypass surgery carries greater risks. However, since coronary artery disease can be related to high fat diets, smoking, and lack of exercise, changes in lifestyle may reduce the risk of developing the disease. Various medications for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and dia- betes also can help treat or prevent coronary artery disease. Preparation Before the stent is inserted, the patient will probably be instructed to take aspirin for several days. Aspirin can help decrease the possibility of blood clots forming at the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 934 Coronary stenting",

Some patients may need to change their diet, stop drinking alcohol, begin a physician-supervised exercise program, and/or stop smoking. Severe congestive cardiomyopathy usually causes heart failure. When the heart muscle is damaged so severely that medicines cannot help, a heart transplant may be the only remaining treatment to be considered. Prognosis The outlook for a patient with congestive cardiomy- opathy depends on the severity of the disease and the person\u2019s health. Generally, congestive cardiomyopathy worsens over time and the prognosis is not good. About 50% of patients with congestive cardiomyopathy live for five years after the diagnosis. Twenty five percent of patients are alive 10 years after diagnosis. Women with congestive cardiomyopathy live twice as long as men with the disease. Many of the deaths are caused by sud- den abnormal heart rhythms. Prevention Because idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy does not have a known cause, there is no sure way to prevent it. The best way to prevent congestive cardiomyopathy is to avoid known causes such as drinking excess alcohol or taking toxic drugs. Eating a nutritious diet and getting regular exercise to improve overall fitness also can help the heart to stay healthy. Congestive cardiomyopathy may also be prevented by identifying and treating any conditions that might damage the heart muscle. These include high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. Regular blood pressure checks and obtaining immediate medical care for hypertension and symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as chest pain, are important to keep the heart functioning properly. Finally, diagnosing and treating congestive car- diomyopathy before the heart becomes severely damaged may improve the outlook. Resources BOOKS Bellenir, Karen, and Peter D. Dresser, eds.

Toni Rizzo Congestive heart failure see Heart failure Congenital heart disease Definition Congenital heart disease, also called congenital heart defect, includes a variety of malformations of the heart or its major blood vessels that are present at birth. Description Congenital heart disease occurs when the heart or blood vessels near the heart do not develop properly before birth. Some infants are born with mild types of congenital heart disease, but most need surgery in order to survive. Patients who have had surgery are likely to experience other cardiac problems later in life. Most types of congenital heart disease obstruct the flow of blood in the heart or the nearby vessels, or cause an abnormal flow of blood through the heart. Rarer types of congenital heart disease occur when the newborn has only one ventricle, or when the pulmonary artery and the aorta come out of the same ventricle, or when one side of the heart is not completely formed. Patent ductus arteriosus Patent ductus arteriosus refers to the opening of a passageway\u2014or temporary blood vessel (ductus)\u2014to carry the blood from the heart to the aorta before birth, allowing blood to bypass the lungs, which are not yet functional. The ductus should close spontaneously in the first few hours or days after birth. When it does not close in the newborn, some of the blood that should flow through the aorta then returns to the lungs. Patent ductus arteriosus is common in premature babies, but rare in full-term babies. It has also been associated with mothers who had German measles (rubella) while pregnant. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a condition in which the left side of the heart is underdeveloped, is rare, but it is the most serious type of congenital heart disease.

For the first 24\u201348 hours after surgery, the colostomy will drain bloody mucus. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenously until the patient\u2019s diet is can gradually be resumed, begin- ning with liquids. Usually within 72 hours, passage of gas and stool through the stoma begins. Initially the stool is liquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to take solid foods. The patient is usually out of bed in 8\u201324 hours after surgery and discharged in 2\u20134 days. A colostomy pouch will generally have been placed on the patient\u2019s abdomen, around the stoma, during surgery. During the hospital stay, the patient and his or her caregivers will be educated on how to care for the colostomy. Determination of appropriate pouching sup- plies and a schedule of how often to change the pouch should be established. Regular assessment and meticu- lous care of the skin surrounding the stoma is important to maintain an adequate surface on which to apply the pouch. Some patients with colostomies are able to rou- tinely irrigate the stoma, resulting in regulation of bowel function; rather than needing to wear a pouch, these patients may need only a dressing or cap over their stoma. Often, an enterostomal therapist will visit the patient at home after discharge to help with the patient\u2019s resumption of normal daily activities.

A loop colostomy is most often performed for creation of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured. Preparation As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be required to sign a consent form after the procedure is explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along with various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG), may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi- ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist, who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen for the stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy management. In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least the day before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid- night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations (GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte- ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec- tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery to remove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom- iting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, giving more space in the surgical field and decreasing chances of accidental injury. Aftercare Post-operative care for the patient with a new colos- tomy, as with those who have had any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia and the patient\u2019s reluctance to breathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the abdominal incision.

Surgery is used as primary therapy for stages I through III colon cancer unless there are signs that local invasion will not permit complete removal of the tumor, as may occur in advanced stage III tumors. However, this circumstance is very rare, and occurs in less than 2% of all colon cancer cases. After the resection is completed, the ends of the remaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is called an anastomosis. Once healing has occurred, there may be a slight increase in the frequency of bowel movements. This effect usually lasts only for several weeks. Most patients go on to develop completely normal bowel function. Occasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and cannot be performed. (Most commonly, this occurs when the bowel could not be adequately evacuated in an emer- gency circumstance due to bowel obstruction.) When the anastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is per- formed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing the end of the colon through the abdominal wall and sewing it to the skin. The patient will have to wear an appliance (a bag) to manage the stool. The colostomy may be tempo- rary and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later, safer date, or the colostomy may be permanent. In most cases, emergent colostomies are not reversed and are permanent. Radiation Radiation therapy is used as an adjunct to surgery if there is concern about potential for local recurrence post-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate the radiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle of the abdominal wall but was not completely removed, this area would be considered for radiation. Radiation has significant dose limits when residual bowel is exposed to it because the small and large intestine do not tolerate radiation well. Radiation is also used in the treatment of patients who present with or progress to having metastatic dis- ease. It is particularly useful in shrinking metastatic colon cancer to the brain. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is useful for patients who have had all identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recur- rence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may also be used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond the scope of regional therapy, but this use is rare. Adjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease with deep penetration or in stage III patients. Standard therapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5FU) combined with leucovorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5FU is an antimetabolite and leukovorin improves the response rate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancer in response to the chemotherapy.) Another agent, lev- amisole, (which seems to stimulate the immune system), may be substituted for leucovorin. These protocols reduce rate of recurrence by about 15% and reduce mor- tality by about 10%. The regimens do have some toxicity, but usually are tolerated fairly well. Similar chemotherapy may be administered for stage IV disease or if a patient progresses and develops metas- tases. Results show response rates of about 20%. Unfortu- nately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease, and this chemotherapy may not prolong survival or improve quality of life in Stage IV patients. Clinical trials have now shown that the results can be improved with the addition of another agent to this regimen. Irinotecan does not seem to increase toxicity but it improved response rates to 39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival, and prolonged overall survival by a little over two months. Alternative treatment Alternative therapies have not been studied in a large-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins , fiber, and green tea are among therapies tried. Avoiding cigarettes and alcohol may be helpful. Before initiating any alternative therapies, the patient is wise to consult his/her physician to be sure that these therapies do not complicate or interfere with the established therapy. Prognosis Prognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after therapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for colon cancer survive the disease. As expected, the survival rates are dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis, making early detection a very worthwhile endeavor. About 15% of patients present with stage I disease and 85\u201390% survive. Stage II represents 20\u201330% of cases and 65\u201375% survive. Thirt to forty percent com- prise the stage III presentation of which 55% survive. The remaining 20\u201325% present with stage IV disease and are very rarely cured. Prevention There is not an absolute way of preventing colon cancer. Still, there are steps an individual can take to dra- matically lessen the risk or to identify the precursors of colon cancer so that it does not manifest itself.

Abscesses can be drained of their infected contents by inserting a needle through the skin of the abdomen and into the abscess. When this is unsuccessful, open abdom- inal surgery will be required to remove the piece of the intestine containing the abscess. Fistulas require surgical repair, including the removal of the length of intestine containing the origin of the fistula, followed by immedi- ate reconnection of the two free ends of intestine. Peri- tonitis requires open surgery. The entire abdominal cavi- ty is cleaned by being irrigated (washed) with a warmed sterile saltwater solution, and the damaged piece of intestine is removed. Obstructions require immediate surgery to prevent perforation. Massive, uncontrollable bleeding, while rare, may require removal of part or all of the large intestine. During any of these types of operations, the surgeon must make an important decision regarding the quantity of intestine which must be removed. When the amount of intestine removed is great, it may be necessary to per- form a colostomy. A colostomy involves pulling the end of the remaining intestine through the abdominal wall, to the outside. This bit of intestine is then fashioned so that a bag can be fit over it. The patient\u2019s waste (feces) collect in the bag, because the intestine no longer connects with the rectum. This colostomy may be temporary, in which case another operation will be required to reconnect the intestine, after some months of substantial healing has occurred. Other times, the colostomy will need to be per- manent, and the patient will have to adjust to living per- manently with the colostomy bag. Most people with colostomies are able to go on with a very active life. Occasionally, a patient will have such severe diver- ticular disease that a surgeon recommends planning ahead, and schedules removal of a portion of the colon. This is done to avoid the high risk of surgery performed after a complication has set in. Certain developments in a patient will identify those patients who are at very high risk of experiencing dangerous complications. Such elec- tive surgery may be recommended: \u2022 when an older individual has had several attacks of diverticulitis \u2022 when someone under the age of 50 has had even one attack \u2022 when treatment does not get rid of a painful mass \u2022 when the intestine appears to be narrowing on x-ray examination (this could suggest the presence of cancer) \u2022 when certain patients begin to regularly experience painful urination or urinary infections (this suggests KEY TERMS Angiography \u2014An x-ray study of the arteries in a particular part of the body.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, MPH Colorectal cancer see Colon cancer; Rectal cancer Colostomy Definition Ostomy is a surgical procedure used to create an opening for urine and feces to be released from the body. Colostomy refers to a surgical procedure where a portion of the large intestine is brought through the abdominal wall to carry stool out of the body. Purpose A colostomy is created as a means to treat various disorders of the large intestine, including cancer, obstruc- tion, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum, ischemia (compromised blood supply), or traumatic injury. Temporary colostomies are created to divert stool from injured or diseased portions of the large intestine, allowing rest and healing. Permanent colostomies are per- formed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest dis- tance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable. Although colorectal cancer is the most common indica- tion for a permanent colostomy, only about 10\u201315% of patients with this diagnosis require a colostomy. Description Surgery will result in one of three types of colos- tomies: \u2022 End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine (the section of bowel that remains connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the sur- face of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing the intestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin. A stoma is an artificial opening created to the surface of the body. The surface of the stoma is actually the lining of the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink. The distal portion of bowel (now connected only to the rec- tum) may be removed, or sutured closed and left in the abdomen. An end colostomy is usually a permanent ostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another patho- logical condition. \u2022 Double\u2013barrel colostomy. This colsotomy involves the creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall. The proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional end that is connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and will drain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectum and also called a mucous fistula, drains small amounts of mucus material. This is most often a temporary colostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to be later closed. \u2022 Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing a loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominal wall. The loop is held in place outside the abdomen by a plastic rod slipped beneath it. An incision is made in the bowel to allow the passage of stool through the loop colostomy. The supporting rod is removed approxi- mately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing has occurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 861 Colostomy",

Individuals with this syndrome have unusual facial features, poor muscle tone(hypotonia), small head size (microcephaly), and mental retardation. A classic feature of the syndrome is the cat- like cry made by infants with this disorder. Description Dr. Jerome Lejeune first described cri du chat syn- drome in 1963. The syndrome is named for the cat-like cry made by infants with this genetic disorder. Cri du chat means \u201ccry of the cat\u201d in French. This unusual cry is caused by abnormal development of the larynx (organ in the throat responsible for voice production). Cri du chat syndrome is also called \u201c5p minus syndrome\u201d because it is caused by a deletion, or removal, of genetic material from chromosome 5. The deletion that causes cri du chat syndrome occurs on the short or \u201cp\u201d arm of chromosome 5. This deleted genetic material is vital for normal devel- opment. Absence of this material results in the features associated with cri du chat syndrome. A high-pitched mewing cry during infancy is a classic feature of cri du chat. Infants with cri du chat also typically have low birth weight, slow growth, a small head (micro- cephaly) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with cri du chat may have congenital heart defects. Individuals with cri du chat syndrome have language difficulties, delayed motor skill development, and mental retardation. Behav- ioral problems may also develop as the child matures. It has been estimated that cri du chat syndrome occurs in one of every 50,000 live births. According to the 5p minus Society, approximately 50\u201360 children are born with cri du chat syndrome in the United States each year. It can occur in all races and in both sexes. Causes and symptoms Cri du chat is the result of a chromosome abnormali- ty\u2014a deleted piece of chromosomal material on chromo- some 5. In 90% of patients with cri du chat syndrome, the deletion is sporadic. This means that it happens ran- domly and is not hereditary. If a child has cri du chat due to a sporadic deletion, the chance the parents could have another child with cri du chat is 1%. In approximately 10% of patients with cri du chat, there is a hereditary chromosomal rearrangement that causes the deletion. If a parent has this rearrangement, the risk for them to have a child with cri du chat is greater than 1%. An abnormal larynx causes the unusual cat-like cry made by infants that is a hallmark feature of the syndrome. As children with cri du chat get older, the cat-like cry becomes less noticeable. This can make the diagnosis more difficult in older patients. In addition to the cat-like GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 954 Cri du chat syndrome",

          "content": "\u2022 Familial CJD, representing 5\u201315% of cases, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that either parent may pass along the disease to a child, who may then develop CJD later in life. \u2022 Iatrogenic CJD occurs when a person is infected during a medical procedure, such as organ donation, blood transfusion , or brain surgery. The rise in organ dona- tion has increased this route of transmission; grafts of infected corneas and dura mater (the tissue covering the brain) have been shown to transmit CJD. Another source is hormones concentrated from the pituitary glands of cadavers, some of whom carried CJD, for use in people with growth hormone deficiencies. Iatrogenic infection from exposure to nerve-containing tissue rep- resents a small fraction of all cases. The incubation period between exposure to the infectious agent is very long and is estimated to be from less than 10 to more than 30 years. It remains unlikely, but not impossible, that blood from patients with CJD is infectious to oth- ers by transfusion. \u2022 Sporadic CJD represents at least 85% of all cases. Spo- radic cases have no identifiable source of infection. Death usually follows first symptoms within eight months. Animal forms and \u201cmad cow disease\u201d Six forms of spongiform encephalopathies are known to occur in other mammals: scrapie in sheep, rec- ognized for more than 200 years; chronic wasting disease in elk and mule deer in Wyoming and Colorado; trans- missible mink encephalopathy; exotic ungulate encephalopathy in some types of zoo animals; feline spongiform encephalopathy in domestic cats; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows. BSE was first recognized in Britain in 1986. Besides the spongiform changes in the brain, BSE causes demen- tia-like behavioral changes\u2014hence the name \u201cmad cow disease.\u201d BSE was thought to be an altered form of scrapie, transmitted to cows when they were fed sheep offal (slaughterhouse waste) as part of their feed, but it is now thought to be more likely to be a primary cattle dis- ease spread by contaminated feed. The use of slaughterhouse offal in animal feed has been common in many countries and has been practiced for at least 50 years. The trigger for the BSE epidemic in Great Britain seems to have come in the early 1980s, when the use of organic solvents for preparation of offal was altered there. It is possible that these solvents had been destroying the agent called a prion, thereby prevent- ing infection, and that the change in preparation proce- dure opened the way for the agent to \u201cjump species\u201d and cause BSE in cows that consumed scrapie-infected meal. The slaughter of infected (but not yet visibly sick) cows at the end of their useful farm lives, and the use of their carcasses for feed, spread the infection rapidly and wide- ly. For at least a year after BSE was first recognized in British herds, infected bovine remains continued to be incorporated into feed, spreading the disease still further. Although milk from infected cows has never been shown to pass the infectious agent, passage from infected moth- er to calf may have occurred through unknown means. Beginning in 1988, the British government took steps to stop the spread of BSE, banning the use of bovine offal in feed and other products and ordering the slaughter of infected cows. By then, the slow-acting agent had become epidemic in British herds. In 1992, it was diagnosed in over 25,000 animals (1% of the British herd). By mid-1997, the cumulative number of BSE cases in the United Kingdom had risen to more than 170,000. The feeding ban did stem the tide of the epidemic; however, the number of new cases each week fell from a peak of 1,000 in 1993 to less than 300 two years later. The export of British feed and beef to member coun- tries was banned by the European Union, but cases of BSE had developed in Europe by then as well; however, by mid-1997, only about 1,000 cases had been identified. In 1989, the United States banned import of British beef and began monitoring United States herds in 1990. To date, no BSE has been detected in the United States, and only one case has been reported in North America in a cow imported to Canada from Great Britain. V ariant CJD: The human equivalent of mad cow disease? From the beginning of the BSE epidemic, scientists and others in Britain feared that BSE might jump species again to infect humans who had consumed infected beef. This, however, had never occurred in scrapie from sheep, a disease known from hundreds of years. In 1996, the first report of this possibility occurred and this fear seemed to be realized with the first cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, termed nvCJD, now just vCJD. Its victims are much younger than the 60\u201365 year old average for CJD, and the time from symptom onset to death has averaged 12 months or more instead of eight. The disease appears to cause more psychiatric symptoms early on. EEG abnormalities characteristic of CJD are not typically seen in vCJD. As of July 2001, the total number of human cases of vCJD is 102. It is of major concern that the number of cases per year seems to be increasing by a factor of 1.35 each year. Almost all the cases have been found in Great Britain with three in France, one in Ireland, and one sus- pected in Hong Kong (who spent time in Great Britain).

Most doctors had never seen a case. With the recognition of a so-called \u201cnew variant\u201d or simply variant form of CJD with the strong possibility that those with it became infected simply by eating contaminated beef, CJD has become one of the most talked-about diseases in the world. Additionally, the radical theory that the infectious agent is a normal protein that has been changed in its form has also sparked much interest. First described in the first part of the twentieth cen- tury independently by Cretzfeldt and Jakob, CJD is a neurodegenerative disease causing a rapidly progressing dementia ending in death, usually within eight months of the onset of symptoms. It is also a very rare disease, affecting only about one in every million in the popula- tion through out the world. In the United States, CJD is thought to affect about 250 people each year. CJD affects adults primarily between ages 50 and 75. Spongiform encephalopathies The most obvious pathologic feature of CJD is the formation of numerous fluid-filled spaces in the brain (vacuoles) resulting in a sponge-like appearance. CJD is one of several human \u201cspongiform encephalopathies,\u201d diseases that produce this characteristic change in brain tissue. Others are kuru; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, a genetic predominantly characterized by cere- bellar ataxia (a kind of movement disorder); and fatal familial insomnia, associated with progressive insomnia, autonomic system disfunction, and weakness caused by motor system dysfunction. Kuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua, New Guinea, and spread from infected individuals after their deaths through the practice of ritual cannibalism, in which the relatives of the dead person honored him by consuming his organs, including the brain. Discovery of the infectious nature of kuru won the Nobel Prize for Carleton Gadjusek in 1976. The incubation period for kuru was between four to 30 years or more. While kuru has virtually disappeared following the cessation of these cannibalistic practices, several new cases continue to arise each year. Cases of CJD have been grouped into three types: familial, iatrogenic, and sporadic. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 950 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease",

Description Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by gradual death of brain cells. The loss of cognitive abilities that occurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory, reasoning, planning, and personality. While the over- whelming number of people with dementia are elderly, it is not an inevitable part of aging. Instead, dementia is caused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common cause, followed by vascular or multi-infarct dementia. The prevalence of dementia has been difficult to determine, partly because of differences in definition among different studies, and partly because there is some normal decline in functional ability with age. Dementia affects 5\u20138% of all people between ages 65 and 74, and up to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates for dementia in those 85 and over range from 30\u201347%. Between two and four million Americans have AD; that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by the middle of the twenty-first century as the population as a whole ages. The cost of dementia can be considerable. While most people with dementia are retired and do not suffer income losses from their disease, the cost of care is often enormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam- ily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and home modifications to ensure safety. Nursing home care may cost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy- chological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can be even more profound. The person with dementia loses control of many of the essential features of his life and personality, and loved ones lose a family member even as they continue to cope with the burdens of increasing dependence and unpredictability. Causes and symptoms Causes Dementia is usually caused by degeneration in the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for thoughts, memories, actions and personality. Death of brain cells in this region leads to the cognitive impair- ment which characterizes dementia. The most common cause of dementia is AD, accounting for half to three quarters of all cases. The brain of a person with AD becomes clogged with two abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted masses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. Senile plaques are composed of parts of neurons surrounding a group of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Why these structures develop is unknown. Current research indicates possible roles for inflammation, blood flow restriction, and toxic molecular fragments known as free radicals. Several genes have been associated with higher incidences of AD, although the exact role of these genes is still unknown. Vascular dementia is estimated to cause from 5\u201330% of all dementias. It occurs from decrease in blood flow to the brain, most commonly due to a series of small strokes (multi-infarct dementia). Other cerebrovascular causes include: vasculitis from syphilis, Lyme disease, or sys- temic lupus erythematosus ; subdural hematoma; and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the usually sud- den nature of its cause, the symptoms of vascular demen- tia tend to begin more abruptly than those of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Symptoms may progress stepwise with the occurrence of new strokes. Unlike AD, the incidence of vascular dementia is lower after age 75. Other conditions which may cause dementia include: \u2022 AIDS \u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2022 Lewy body disease \u2022 Pick\u2019s disease GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1024 Dementia",

          "content": "Colic Definition Colic is persistent, unexplained crying in a healthy baby between two weeks and five months of age. Description Colic, which is not a disease, affects 10\u201320% of all infants. It is more common in boys than in girls and most common in a family\u2019s first child. Symptoms of colic usu- ally appear when a baby is 14\u201321 days old, reach a crescendo at the age of three months, and disappear with- in the next eight weeks. Episodes occur frequently but intermittently and usually begin with prolonged periods of crying in the late afternoon or evening. They can last for just a few minutes or continue for several hours. Some babies who have colic are simply fussy. Others cry so hard that their faces turn red, then pale. Causes and symptoms No one knows what causes colic. The condition may be the result of swallowing large amounts of air, which becomes trapped in the digestive tract and causes bloat- ing and severe abdominal pain. Other possible causes of colic include: \u2022 digestive tract immaturity \u2022 food intolerances \u2022 hunger or overfeeding \u2022 lack of sleep \u2022 loneliness \u2022 overheated milk or formula \u2022 overstimulation resulting from noise, light, or activity \u2022 tension During a colicky episode, babies\u2019 bellies often look swollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound. Crying intensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many babies grow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and draw their legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel move- ment can end an attack. Most babies who have colic don\u2019t seem to be in pain between attacks. Diagnosis Pediatricians and family physicians suspect colic in an infant who: \u2022 has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least three times a week for three weeks or longer \u2022 is not hungry but cries for several hours between din- nertime and midnight \u2022 demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other physical traits associated with colic The baby\u2019s medical history and a parent\u2019s descrip- tion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used to confirm a diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and laboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinal blockage, and other conditions that can cause abdominal pain and other colic-like symptoms. Treatment Medications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes recommend simethicone (Mylicon Drops) to relieve gas pain, but generally advise parents to take a practical approach to the problem. Gently massaging the baby\u2019s back can release a trapped gas bubble, and holding the baby in a sitting position can help prevent air from being swallowed dur- ing feedings. Bottle-fed babies can swallow air if nipple holes are either too large or too small. Nipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle with cold formula, turning it upside down, and counting the number of drops released when it is shaken or squeezed. A nipple hole that is the right size will release about one drop of formula every second. Babies should not be fed every time they cry, but feeding and burping a baby more often may alleviate symptoms of colic. A bottle-fed baby should be burped after every ounce, and a baby who is breastfeeding should be burped every five minutes. When cow\u2019s milk is the source of the symptoms, bottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy milk hydrolyzed protein formula. A woman whose baby is breastfeeding should eliminate dairy products from her diet for seven days, then gradually reintroduce them unless the baby\u2019s symptoms reappear. Since intolerance to foods other than cow\u2019s milk may also lead to symptoms of colic, breastfeeding women may also relieve their babies\u2019 colic by eliminating from their diet: \u2022 coffee \u2022 tea \u2022 cocoa \u2022 citrus \u2022 peanuts \u2022 wheat \u2022 broccoli and other vegetables belonging to the cabbage family GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 847 Colic",

Some patients may need to change their diet, stop drinking alcohol, begin a physician-supervised exercise program, and/or stop smoking. Severe congestive cardiomyopathy usually causes heart failure. When the heart muscle is damaged so severely that medicines cannot help, a heart transplant may be the only remaining treatment to be considered. Prognosis The outlook for a patient with congestive cardiomy- opathy depends on the severity of the disease and the person\u2019s health. Generally, congestive cardiomyopathy worsens over time and the prognosis is not good. About 50% of patients with congestive cardiomyopathy live for five years after the diagnosis. Twenty five percent of patients are alive 10 years after diagnosis. Women with congestive cardiomyopathy live twice as long as men with the disease. Many of the deaths are caused by sud- den abnormal heart rhythms. Prevention Because idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy does not have a known cause, there is no sure way to prevent it. The best way to prevent congestive cardiomyopathy is to avoid known causes such as drinking excess alcohol or taking toxic drugs. Eating a nutritious diet and getting regular exercise to improve overall fitness also can help the heart to stay healthy. Congestive cardiomyopathy may also be prevented by identifying and treating any conditions that might damage the heart muscle. These include high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. Regular blood pressure checks and obtaining immediate medical care for hypertension and symptoms of coronary artery disease, such as chest pain, are important to keep the heart functioning properly. Finally, diagnosing and treating congestive car- diomyopathy before the heart becomes severely damaged may improve the outlook. Resources BOOKS Bellenir, Karen, and Peter D. Dresser, eds.

Toni Rizzo Congestive heart failure see Heart failure Congenital heart disease Definition Congenital heart disease, also called congenital heart defect, includes a variety of malformations of the heart or its major blood vessels that are present at birth. Description Congenital heart disease occurs when the heart or blood vessels near the heart do not develop properly before birth. Some infants are born with mild types of congenital heart disease, but most need surgery in order to survive. Patients who have had surgery are likely to experience other cardiac problems later in life. Most types of congenital heart disease obstruct the flow of blood in the heart or the nearby vessels, or cause an abnormal flow of blood through the heart. Rarer types of congenital heart disease occur when the newborn has only one ventricle, or when the pulmonary artery and the aorta come out of the same ventricle, or when one side of the heart is not completely formed. Patent ductus arteriosus Patent ductus arteriosus refers to the opening of a passageway\u2014or temporary blood vessel (ductus)\u2014to carry the blood from the heart to the aorta before birth, allowing blood to bypass the lungs, which are not yet functional. The ductus should close spontaneously in the first few hours or days after birth. When it does not close in the newborn, some of the blood that should flow through the aorta then returns to the lungs. Patent ductus arteriosus is common in premature babies, but rare in full-term babies. It has also been associated with mothers who had German measles (rubella) while pregnant. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a condition in which the left side of the heart is underdeveloped, is rare, but it is the most serious type of congenital heart disease.

          "content": "cy or shortly after a woman gives birth. This type of con- gestive cardiomyopathy is called peripartum cardiomy- opathy. The cause of congestive cardiomyopathy in preg- nancy is not known. Congestive cardiomyopathy usually is a chronic condition, developing gradually over time. Patients with early congestive cardiomyopathy may not have symp- toms. The most common symptoms are fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. Unfortunately, sudden cardiac death is not uncommon with this condition. It stems from irregular heart rhythms in the ventricles (ven- tricular arrhythmias). Patients with more advanced congestive cardiomy- opathy may also have chest or abdominal pains, extreme tiredness, dizziness, and swelling of the legs and ankles. Diagnosis Diagnosis of congestive cardiomyopathy is based on: \u2022 symptoms \u2022 medical history \u2022 physical examination \u2022 chest x ray \u2022 electrocardiogram (ECG; also called EKG) \u2022 echocardiogram \u2022 cardiac catheterization The diagnosis is based on the patient\u2019s symptoms, a complete physical examination, and tests that detect abnormalities of the heart chambers. The physician lis- tens to the heart with a stethoscope to detect abnormal heart rhythms and heart sounds. A heart murmur might mean that the heart valves are not closing properly due to the ventricles being enlarged. A chest x ray can show if the heart is enlarged and if there is fluid in the lungs. Abnormalities of heart valves and other structures may also be seen on a chest x ray. An electrocardiogram provides a record of electrical changes in the heart muscle during the heartbeat. It gives information on the heart rhythm and can show if the heart chamber is enlarged. An ECG can detect damage to the heart muscle and the amount of damage. Echocardiography uses sound waves to make images of the heart. These images can show if the heart wall or chambers are enlarged and if there are any abnor- malities of the heart valves. Echocardiography can also evaluate the pumping efficiency of the ventricles. Cardiac catheterization usually is only used if a diagnosis cannot be made with other methods. In cardiac catheterization, a small tube (called a catheter) is inserted into an artery and passed into the heart. It is used to mea- sure pressure in the heart and the amount of blood pumped by the heart. A small tissue sample of the heart muscle can be removed through the catheter for examina- tion under a microscope (biopsy). This biopsy can show the type and amount of damage to the heart muscle. Treatment When a patient is diagnosed with congestive car- diomyopathy, physicians try to find out the cause. If coronary artery disease is not the culprit, in most other cases a cause is not identified. When a condition respon- sible for the congestive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condi- tion. Congestive cardiomyopathy caused by drinking excess alcohol or by drugs or toxins can be treated by eliminating the alcohol or toxin completely. In some cases, the heart may recover after the toxic substance is removed from the body. Bacterial myocarditis is treated with an antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria. There is no cure for idiopathic congestive cardiomy- opathy. Medicines are given to reduce the workload of the heart and to relieve the symptoms. One or more of the following types of medicines may be prescribed for congestive cardiomyopathy: \u2022 digitalis \u2022 diuretics \u2022 vasodilators \u2022 beta blockers \u2022 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhib- itors) \u2022 angiotensin receptor blockers Digitalis helps the heart muscle to have stronger pumping action. Diuretics help eliminate excess salt and water from the kidneys by making patients urinate more often. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluid buildup in the tissues. Vasodilators, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and expand the blood vessels so blood can move more easily through them. This action makes it easier for the heart to pump blood through the vessels. Patients may also be given anticoagulant medica- tions to prevent clots from forming due to pooling of blood in the heart chambers. Medicines to prevent abnor- mal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) may be given, but some of these drugs can also reduce the force of heart contrac- tions. Automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICDs) can treat life-threatening arrhythmias, which are relatively common in severe cardiomyopathy.

Coronary artery disease is one of the most common causes of congestive cardiomyopathy. In coronary artery disease, the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. When blood flow to an area of the heart is completely blocked, the person has a heart attack. The heart muscle suffers damage when its blood supply is reduced or blocked. Significant recurrent mus- cle damage can occur silently. This damage can lead to congestive cardiomyopathy.

Once cor- rection of the cause is addressed and there is unimpeded flow of urine, adequate fluid intake can contribute to pre- vention of future infections. Prognosis As long as damage to the kidneys from infection or back pressure has not become significant, the surgical repair of troublesome ureteral defects produces excellent long-term results in the great majority of cases. Monitor- ing for recurrent infections is always a good idea, and occasional checking of kidney function will detect hid- den ongoing damage.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD Congestive cardiomyopathy Definition Cardiomyopathy is an ongoing disease process that damages the muscle wall of the lower chambers of the heart. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the most common form of cardiomyopathy. In congestive cardiomyopathy, also called dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of the heart chambers stretch (dilate) to hold a greater volume of blood than normal. Congestive cardiomyopathy is the final stage of many heart diseases and the most common condition resulting in congestive heart failure. Description About 50,000 Americans develop cardiomyopathy each year. Of those, 87% have congestive cardiomyopa- thy. Primary cardiomyopathy accounts for only 1% of all deaths from heart disease. When the heart muscle is damaged by a disease process, it cannot pump enough blood to meet the body\u2019s needs. Uninjured areas of the walls of the two lower heart chambers (called ventricles) stretch to make up for the lost pumping action. At first, the enlarged chambers allow more blood to be pumped with less force. The stretched muscle can also contract more forcefully. Over time, the heart muscle continues to stretch, ultimately becoming weaker. The heart is forced to work harder to pump blood by beating faster. Eventually it cannot keep up, and blood backs up into the veins, legs, and lungs. When this hap- pens, the condition is called congestive heart failure. Congestive cardiomyopathy usually affects both ventricles. Blood backed up into the lungs from the left ventricle causes fluid to congest the lung tissue. This is called pulmonary edema. When the right ventricle fails to pump enough blood, blood backs up into the veins causing edema in the legs, feet, ankles, and abdomen. Causes and symptoms Congestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a number of conditions. Cardiomyopathy with a known cause is called secondary cardiomyopathy. When no cause can be identified, it is called primary cardiomyopa- thy or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. About 80% of all cases of cardiomyopathy do not have a known cause. Many heart specialists think that many cases of idiopathic con- gestive cardiomyopathy may be caused by a viral infec- tion. Because cardiomyopathy may occur many years after a viral infection and viruses sometimes go undetect- ed in laboratory tests, it is difficult to know if a virus is the cause. Some people have a weak heart from advanced coronary artery disease that causes heart muscle dam- age. This is sometimes called ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The curette is used to scrape away the uterine lin- ing.

          "content": "Diabetic neuropathy Definition Diabetic neuropathy is a nerve disorder caused by diabetes mellitus . Diabetic neuropathy may be diffuse, affecting several parts of the body, or focal, affecting a specific nerve and part of the body. Description The nervous system consists of two major divisions: the central nervous systems (CNS) which includes the brain, the cranial nerves, and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which includes the nerves that link the CNS with the sensory organs, mus- cles, blood vessels, and glands of the body. These periph- eral nerves are either motor, meaning that they are involved in motor activity such as walking, or sensory, meaning that they carry sensory information back to the CNS. The PNS also works with the CNS to regulate involuntary (autonomic) processes such as breathing, heartbeat, blood pressure, etc. There are two types of diffuse diabetic neuropathy that affect different nervous system functions. Diffuse peripheral neuropathy primarily affects the limbs, dam- aging the nerves of the feet and hands. Autonomic neu- ropathy is the other form of diffuse neuropathy and it affects the heart and other internal organs. Focal\u2014or localized\u2014diabetic neuropathy affects specific nerves, most commonly in the torso, leg, or head. Diabetic neuropathy can lead to muscular weakness, loss of feeling or sensation, and loss of autonomic func- tions such as digestion, erection, bladder control and sweating among others. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely the development of one or more forms of neuropathy. Approximately 60\u201370% of patients with diabetes have neuropathy, but only about 5% will experience painful symptoms. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of diabetic neuropathy is not known. Researchers believe that the process of nerve damage is related to high glucose concentrations in the blood that could cause chemical changes in nerves, dis- rupting their ability to effectively send messages. High blood glucose is also known to damage the blood vessels that carry oxygen and other nutrients to the nerves. In addition, some people may have a genetic predisposition to develop neuropathy. There is a wide range of symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy, and they depend on which nerves and parts of the body affected and also on the type of neuropathy present. Some patients have very mild symp- toms, while others are severely disabled. Common symptoms of diffuse peripheral neuropa- thy include: \u2022 numbness and feelings of tingling or burning \u2022 insensitivity to pain \u2022 needle-like jabs of pain \u2022 extreme sensitivity to touch \u2022 loss of balance and coordination Common symptoms of diffuse autonomic neuropa- thy include: \u2022 impaired urination and sexual function \u2022 bladder infections \u2022 stomach disorders, due to the impaired ability of the stomach to empty (gastric stasis) \u2022 nausea, vomiting, bloating \u2022 dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells \u2022 loss of appetite Common symptoms of focal neuropathy include: \u2022 pain in the front of a thigh \u2022 severe pain in the lower back \u2022 pain in the chest or stomach \u2022 ache behind an eye \u2022 double vision \u2022 paralysis on one side of the face In severe diabetic neuropathy loss of sensation can lead to injuries that are unnoticed, progressing to infec- tions, ulceration, and possibly amputation. Diagnosis The diagnosis of neuropathy is based on the symp- toms that present during a physical exam. Pain assess- ment is usually the first step. Patients may have more than one type of pain, and the history helps the doctor determine whether a the pain has a neuropathic cause. The exam may include: \u2022 a screening test for lost sensation \u2022 nerve conduction studies to check the flow of electric current through a nerve \u2022 electromyography (EMG) to see how well muscles respond to electrical impulses transmitted by nearby nerves.

Krajewski, MS, CGC Charcot\u2019s joints Definition Charcot\u2019s joints is a progressive degenerative disease of the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in the loss of ability to feel pain in the joint and instability of the joint. Description Charcot\u2019s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis- ease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint. The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint due to nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to the joint go unnoticed leading to instability and making the joint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated small injuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until finally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro- tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegration of the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint. Although this condition can affect any joint, the knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals with diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it may affect two or three joints. More than three affected joints is very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affected depends on the location of the nerve damage. Causes and symptoms Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil- ity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, spinal injuries and diseases,alcoholism, and even syphilis can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in some areas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital. The symptoms of Charcot\u2019s joints can go unnoticed for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint without the expected pain, or with less pain than would be expected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. As the condition progresses, however, the joint can become very painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths. Diagnosis Charcot\u2019s joints is suspected when a person with a disease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painless swelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays will show damage to the joint, and may also show abnormal bone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag- ments from previous injuries may also be visible. Treatment In the early stages of Charcot\u2019s joints, braces to sta- bilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage. When the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgery can sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten- sive, an artificial joint may be necessary. Prognosis Treatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep- tion may help to slow the damage to the joints. Prevention Preventing or effectively managing the underlying disease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage, but the condition cannot be prevented. Resources BOOKS Resnick, Donald.

Maureen Haggerty Diabetic ketoacidosis Definition Diabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which the chemical balance of the body becomes far too acidic. Description Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a severe insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret- ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels when they become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the disease resulting from the inability of the body to produce or respond properly to insulin, required by the body to convert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKA complications represent the leading cause of death , mostly due to the accumulation of abnormally large amounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA combines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean- ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone- mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by the body; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has become too acidic. Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi- tions: the body glucose goes largely unused since most cells are unable to transport glucose into the cell without the presence of insulin; this condition makes the body use stored fat as an alternative source instead of the unavailable glucose for energy, a process that produces acidic ketones, which build up because they require insulin to be broken down. The presence of excess ketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood to become more acidic than the body tissues, which creates a toxic condition. Causes and symptoms DKA is most commonly seen in individuals with type I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usually caused by the interruption of their insulin treatment or by acute infection or trauma. A small number of people with type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, but this is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro- duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in type II patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in food intake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper- glycemia. Some common DKA symptoms include: \u2022 high blood sugar levels \u2022 frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst \u2022 fatigue and lethargy \u2022 nausea \u2022 vomiting \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 fruity odor to breath \u2022 rapid, deep breathing \u2022 muscle stiffness or aching \u2022 coma Diagnosis Diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper- glycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab- lished if the patient\u2019s urine or blood is strongly positive for glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non- diabetic person on average range from 80\u2013110 mg/dl. A person with diabetes will typically fluctuate outside those parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dl and can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon- ate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present, indicative of acidosis. A blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Test strips are available to patients commercially can sub- merge in urine to detect the presence or concentration of ketones. Treatment Ketoacidosis is treated under medical supervision and usually in a hospital setting. Basic treatment includes: \u2022 administering insulin to correct the hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1055 Diabetic ketoacidosis",

Diabetes can also develop as a result of pancreatic disease, alcoholism , malnutrition , or other severe ill- nesses that stress the body. Causes and symptoms Causes The causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev- er, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factors passed on in families) and environmental factors involved. Research has shown that some people who develop diabetes have common genetic markers. In Type I diabetes, the immune system, the body\u2019s defense sys- tem against infection, is believed to be triggered by a virus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age, obesity, and family history of diabetes play a roll. In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to the insulin produced and it may not work as effectively. Symptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually that a person may not know that they have it. Early signs are lethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Other symptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow wound healing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurred vision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect- ed while a patient is seeing a doctor about another health concern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag- nosed diabetes. Individuals who are at high risk of developing Type II diabetes mellitus include people who: \u2022 are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body weight) \u2022 have a relative with diabetes mellitus \u2022 belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer- ican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian) \u2022 have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have delivered a baby weighing more than 9 lbs (4 kg) \u2022 have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above) \u2022 have a high density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than or equal to 35 mg/dL and/or a triglyceride level greater than or equal to 250 mg/dL \u2022 have had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fast- ing glucose on previous testing Several common medications can impair the body\u2019s use of insulin, causing a condition known as secondary diabetes. These medications include treatments for high blood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide diuretics ), drugs with hormonal activity ( oral contra- ceptives , thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti- corids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin. Several drugs that are used to treat mood disorders (such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose absorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car- bonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and adrenergic agonists. Other medications that can cause diabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid, cimetidine, and heparin. Symptoms Symptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over days or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles- cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in overweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp- toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination, excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss. Ketoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or uncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes. Ketones are acid compounds that form in the blood when the body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, extreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci- dosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated, this condition can lead to coma and death. With Type II diabetes, the condition may not become evident until the patient presents for medical treatment for some other condition. A patient may have heart disease, chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract, blurred vision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-healing wounds. Women may experience genital itching.

There is no cure for the permanent nerve damage caused by neuropathy. To help control pain, the choice of proven drug therapies has broadened during the past decade. Pain medication, such as the topical skin cream capsaicin, is usually no stronger than codeine because of the potential for addiction with long-term use of such drugs. Four main classes of drugs are available for pain management, alone or in combination: tricyclic antide- pressants (Imipramine, Nortriptyline), narcotic anal- gesics (Morphine), anticonvulsants (Carbamazepine, Gabapentin), and antiarrhythmics.

The cranial nerves and spinal cord link the brain to the peripheral nervous sys- tem. Diabetes mellitus \u2014Disease characterized by the inability of the body to produce or respond prop- erly to insulin, required by the body to convert glucose to energy. Glucose\u2014The type of sugar found in the blood. Peripheral nervous system (PNS)\u2014One of the two major divisions of the nervous system. PNS nerves link the central nervous system with sensory organs, muscles, blood vessels, and glands. Prognosis Early stage diabetic neuropathy can usually be reversed with good glucose control. Once nerve damage has occurred it cannot be reversed. The prognosis is largely dependent on the management of the underlying condition, diabetes, which may halt the progression of the neuropathy and improve symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, is slow. Prevention Tight glucose control and the avoidance of alcohol and cigarettes help protect nerves from damage. Resources BOOKS Saudek, Christopher D., Richard R. Rubin, and Cynthia S. Shump.

Through the use of a blood filter and a chemical solution known as dialysate, the treatment removes waste products and excess fluids from the bloodstream, while maintaining the proper chemical bal- ance of the blood. There are two types of dialysis treat- ment : hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Purpose Dialysis can be used in the treatment of patients suf- fering from poisoning or overdose, in order to quickly remove drugs from the bloodstream. Its most prevalent application, however, is for patients with temporary or per- manent kidney failure. For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), whose kidneys are no longer capable of adequately removing fluids and wastes from their body or GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21058 Dialysis, kidney",

          "content": "Regular insulin is fast-acting and starts to work within 15\u201330 minutes, with its peak glucose-lowering effect about two hours after it is injected. Its effects last for about four to six hours. NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) and Lente insulin are intermediate-acting, starting to work within one to three hours and lasting up to 18\u201326 hours. Ultra-lente is a long-acting form of insulin that starts to work within four to eight hours and lasts 28\u201336 hours. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be caused by too much insulin, too little food (or eating too late to coincide with the action of the insulin), alcohol con- sumption, or increased exercise. A patient with symp- toms of hypoglycemia may be hungry, cranky, confused, and tired. The patient may become sweaty and shaky. Left untreated, the patient can lose consciousness or have a seizure. This condition is sometimes called an insulin reaction and should be treated by giving the patient something sweet to eat or drink like a candy, sugar cubes, juice, or another high sugar snack. Surgery Transplantation of a healthy pancreas into a diabetic patient is a successful treatment, however, this transplant is usually done only if a kidney transplant is performed at the same time. Although a pancreas transplant is possi- ble, it is not clear if the potential benefits outweigh the risks of the surgery and drug therapy needed. Alternative treatment Since diabetes can be life-threatening if not properly managed, patients should not attempt to treat this condi- tion without medicial supervision. A variety of alterna- tive therapies can be helpful in managing the symptoms of diabetes and supporting patients with the disease. Acupuncture can help relieve the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy by stimulation of cetain points. A qualified practitioner should be consulted. Herbal reme- dies may also be helpful in managing diabetes. Although there is no herbal substitute for insulin, some herbs may help adjust blood sugar levels or manage other diabetic symptoms. Some options include: \u2022 fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ) has been shown in some studies to reduce blood insulin and glu- cose levels while also lowering cholesterol \u2022 bilberry ( Vaccinium myrtillus ) may lower blood glu- cose levels, as well as helping to maintain healthy blood vessels \u2022 garlic (Allium sativum) may lower blood sugar and cho- lesterol levels \u2022 onions ( Allium cepa ) may help lower blood glucose levels by freeing insulin to metabolize it \u2022 cayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens) can help relieve pain in the peripheral nerves (a type of diabetic neu- ropathy) \u2022 ginkgo (Gingko biloba) may maintain blood flow to the retina, helping to prevent diabetic retinopathy Any therapy that lowers stress levels can also be use- ful in treating diabetes by helping to reduce insulin requirements. Among the alternative treatments that aim to lower stress are hypnotherapy , biofeedback , and meditation. Prognosis Uncontrolled diabetes is a leading cause of blind- ness, end-stage renal disease, and limb amputations. It also doubles the risks of heart disease and increases the risk of stroke. Eye problems including cataracts , glau- coma, and diabetic retinopathy are also more common in diabetics. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a condition where nerve endings, particularly in the legs and feet become less sensitive. Diabetic foot ulcers are a partic- ular problem since the patient does not feel the pain of a blister, callous, or other minor injury. Poor blood cir- culation in the legs and feet contribute to delayed wound healing. The inability to sense pain along with the complications of delayed wound healing can result in minor injuries, blisters, or callouses becoming infected and difficult to treat. In cases of severe infec- tion, the infected tissue begins to break down and rot away. The most serious consequence of this condition is the need for amputation of toes, feet, or legs due to severe infection. Heart disease and kidney disease are common com- plications of diabetes. Long-term complications may include the need for kidney dialysis or a kidney trans- plant due to kidney failure. Babies born to diabetic mothers have an increased risk of birth defects and distress at birth. Prevention Research continues on ways to prevent diabetes and to detect those at risk for developing diabetes. While the onset of Type I diabetes is unpredictable, the risk of developing Type II diabetes can be reduced by maintain- ing ideal weight and exercising regularly. The physical and emotional stress of surgery, illness, pregnancy, and alcoholism can increase the risks of diabetes, so main- taining a healthy lifestyle is critical to preventing the onset of Type II diabetes and preventing further compli- cations of the disease.

Altha Roberts Edgren Diabetic control index see Glycosylated hemoglobin test Diabetic foot infections Definition Diabetic foot infections are infections that can develop in the skin, muscles, or bones of the foot as a result of the nerve damage and poor circulation that is associated with diabetes. Description People who have diabetes have a greater-than-average chance of developing foot infections. Because a person who has diabetes may not feel foot pain or discomfort, problems can remain undetected until fever, weakness, or other signs of systemic infection appear. As a result, even minor irritations occur more often, heal more slowly, and are more likely to result in serious health problems. With diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently because the disease causes nervous system changes and poor circulation. Because the nerves that control sweat- ing no longer work, the skin of the feet can become very dry and cracked, and calluses tend to occur more fre- quently and build up faster. If not trimmed regularly, these calluses can turn into open sores or ulcers. Because diabetic nerve damage can cause a loss of sensation (neu- ropathy), if the feet are not regularly inspected, an ulcer can quickly become infected and, if not treated, may result in the death of tissue (gangrene) or amputation. The risk of infection is greatest for people who are over the age of 60 and for those who have one or more of the following: \u2022 poorly controlled diabetes \u2022 foot ulcers \u2022 laser treatment for changes in the retina \u2022 kidney or vascular disease \u2022 loss of sensation (neuropathy) Causes and symptoms Bacteria can cause an infection through small cracks (fissures) that can develop in the dry skin around the heel and on other parts of the foot or through corns, calluses, blisters, hangnails, or ulcers. If not treated, the bacterial infection can destroy skin, tissue, and bone or spread throughout the body. Common sites of diabetic foot infections include the following: \u2022 blisters, corns, or callouses that bleed beneath the skin \u2022 bunions, hammertoes, or other abnormalities in the bones of the foot GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1053 Diabetic foot infections",

Diagnosis A physician who specializes in the treatment of the foot (podiatrist) or the doctor who normally treats the patient\u2019s diabetes will treat the infection. An x ray of the foot will be taken to determine whether the bone has become infected. A sample from the wound will be cul- tured to identify the organism that is causing the infec- tion so that the appropriate antibiotic can be selected. Treatment From the results of the culture, the appropriate antibiotic will be prescribed. Any dead or infected tissue will be surgically removed and, if necessary, a cast and/or special shoes may be used to protect the area. In addition, the patient will be instructed to keep off their feet. If the ulcer does not heal, the physician may per- form surgery to increase blood flow to the foot. It is also important for the patient to practice good diabetes con- trol and keep blood glucose levels from getting too high. Alternative treatment Acupuncture and vitamin C can boost the body\u2019s infection-fighting ability. A variety of other vitamins and herbs may improve general health and diabetes control. Because diabetes is a potentially deadly disease, it can be dangerous to try alternative approaches without a doc- tor\u2019s approval or without consulting a trained practitioner of alternative medicine. Prognosis Without proper treatment, diabetic foot infections can lead to serious illness, gangrene, amputation, and even death if the infection spreads throughout the body.

          "content": "Carbohydrate intolerance Definition Carbohydrate intolerance is the inability of the body to completely process the nutrient carbohydrate (a classi- fication that includes sugars and starches) into a source of energy for the body, usually because of the deficiency of an enzyme needed for digestion. Lactose intolerance, the inability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespread and affects up to 70% of the world\u2019s adult population. Description Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy and, along with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri- ents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classified according to their structure based on the number of basic sugar, or saccharide units they contain. A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and called a simple sugar. Simple sugars include glucose (the form in which sugar circulates in the blood), fructose (found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced by the digestion of milk). These simple sugars are important because they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Two simple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. The disaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (a product of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar), and lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides must be broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars so that they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha- rides are much more complex carbohydrates made up of many simple sugars, the most important of which are glycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch. Digestion of sugars Digestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to the stomach, and then into the small intestine. Along the way, specific enzymes are needed to process different types of sugars. An enzyme is a substance that acts as a catalyst to produce chemical changes without being changed itself. The enzymes lactase, maltase, and isoma- ltase (or sucrase) are needed to break down the disaccha- rides; when one or more is inadequate, the result is car- bohydrate intolerance. Types of intolerance Carbohydrate intolerance can be primary or sec- ondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defect present at birth or developed over time. The most common is lactose intolerance. Secondary deficiencies are caused by a disease or disorder of the intestinal tract, and disap- pear when the disease is treated. These include protein deficiency,celiac disease, and some intestinal infections. Adult lactose intolerance is the most common of all enzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30\u201350 mil- lion Americans have this condition. Some racial and eth- nic populations are affected more than others. Lactose intolerance is found in as many as 75% of African Ameri- cans, Jewish Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans, and in 90% of Asian Americans. Descendants of Northern Europeans and some Mediterranean peoples usually do not develop the condition. Deficiencies in enzymes other than lactase are extremely rare. Causes and symptoms Enzymes play an important role in breaking down carbohydrates into forms that can pass through the intes- tine and be used by the body. Usually they are named by adding ase to the name of the substance they act on, so lactase is the enzyme needed to process lactose. Cooked starch is broken down in the mouth to a disaccharide by amylase, an enzyme in the saliva. The disaccharides mal- tose, sucrose, and lactose cannot be absorbed until they have been separated into simple sugar molecules by their corresponding enzymes present in the cells lining the intestinal tract. If this process is not completed, digestion is interrupted. Although not common, a deficiency in the enzymes needed to digest lactose, maltose, and sucrose is some- times present at birth. Intestinal lactase enzymes usually decrease naturally with age, but this happens to varying degrees. Because of the uneven distribution of enzyme deficiency based on race and ethnic heritage, especially in lactose intolerance, genetics are believed to play a role in the cause of primary carbohydrate intolerance. Digestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropi- cal sprue (which affect absorption in the intestine), as well as intestinal infections and injuries, can reduce the amount of enzymes produced. In cancer patients, treat- ment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy may affect the cells in the intestine that normally secrete lac- tase, leading to intolerance. The severity of the symptoms depends on the extent of the enzyme deficiency, and range from a feeling of mild bloating to severe diarrhea. In the case of a lactase deficiency, undigested milk sugar remains in the intes- tine, which is then fermented by the bacteria normally present in the intestine. These bacteria produce gas, cramping, bloating, a \u201cgurgly\u201d feeling in the abdomen, and flatulence. In a growing child, the main symptoms are diarrhea and a failure to gain weight.

Karen Ericson, RN Carbon monoxide poisoning Definition Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when car- bon monoxide gas is inhaled. CO is a colorless, odorless, highly poisonous gas that is produced by incomplete combustion. It is found in automobile exhaust fumes, faulty stoves and heating systems, fires, and cigarette smoke. Other sources include woodburning stoves, kerosene heaters, improperly ventilated water heaters and gas stoves, and blocked or poorly maintained chim- ney flues. CO interferes with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. The result is headache , nausea, convul- sions, and finally death by asphyxiation. Description Carbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has been known as a toxic substance since the third century B.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early Rome. Today it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in the United States. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, 1,500 Americans die each year from accidental exposure to CO, and another 2,300 from inten- tional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 people seek medical attention after exposure to CO and recover. Anyone who is exposed to CO will become sick, and the entire body is involved in CO poisoning. A develop- ing fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant woman breathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or lung dis- ease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affect- ed. People such as underground parking garage atten- dants who are exposed to car exhausts in a confined area are more likely to be poisoned by CO. Firemen also run a higher risk of inhaling CO. Causes and symptoms Normally when a person breathes fresh air into the lungs, the oxygen in the air binds with a molecule called hemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood cells. This allows oxygen to be moved from the lungs to every part of the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complex reaches a muscle where it is needed, the oxygen is released. Because the oxygen binding process is reversible, hemoglobin can be used over and over again to pick up oxygen and move it throughout the body. Inhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this oxygen transport system. In the lungs, CO competes with oxygen to bind with the hemoglobin molecule. Hemo- globin prefers CO to oxygen and accepts it more than 200 times more readily than it accepts oxygen. Not only does the hemoglobin prefer CO, it holds on to the CO much more tightly, forming a complex called carboxyhe- moglobin (COHb). As a person breathes CO contaminat- ed air, more and more oxygen transportation sites on the hemoglobin molecules become blocked by CO. Gradual- ly, there are fewer and fewer sites available for oxygen. All cells need oxygen to live. When they don\u2019t get enough oxygen, cellular metabolism is disrupted and eventually cells begin to die. The symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed with which they appear depend on the concentration of CO in the air and the rate and efficiency with which a person breathes. Heavy smokers can start off with up to 9% of their hemoglobin already bound to CO, which they regu- larly inhale in cigarette smoke. This makes them much more susceptible to environmental CO. The Occupation- al Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estab- lished a maximum permissible exposure level of 50 parts per million (ppm) over eight hours. With exposure to 200 ppm for two to three hours, a person begins to experience headache, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness . These symptoms correspond to 15\u201325% COHb in the blood. When the concentration of COHb reaches 50% or more, death results in a very short time. Emergency room physicians have the most experience diagnosing and treating CO poisoning.

Food intolerances can be con- fused with food allergies, since the symptoms of nausea, cramps, bloating, and diarrhea are similar. Sugars that aren\u2019t broken down into one of the sim- plest forms cause the body to push fluid into the intestines, which results in watery diarrhea (osmotic diarrhea). Diar- rhea may sweep other nutrients out of the intestine before they can be absorbed, causing malnutrition. Diagnosis Carbohydrate intolerance can be diagnosed using oral tolerance tests. The carbohydrate being investigated is given by mouth in liquid form and several blood levels are measured and compared to normal values. This helps evaluate the individual\u2019s ability to digest the sugar. To identify lactose intolerance in children and adults, the hydrogen breath test is used to measure the amount of hydrogen in the breath. The patient drinks a beverage containing lactose and the breath is analyzed at regular intervals. If undigested lactose in the large intestine (colon) is fermented by bacteria, various gases are produced. Hydrogen is absorbed from the intestines KEY TERMS Celiac disease\u2014A disease, occurring in both chil- dren and adults, which is caused by a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in grains. It results in chronic inflammation and shrinkage of the lining of the small intestine. Digestion\u2014The mechanical, chemical, and enzy- matic process in which food is converted into the materials suitable for use by the body. Enzyme\u2014A substance produced by the body to assist in a chemical reaction. In carbohydrate intolerance, lack of an enzyme makes it impossi- ble for one type of sugar to be broken down into a simpler form so that it can be absorbed by the intestines and used by the body. Metabolism \u2014All the physical and chemical changes that take place within an organism. Nutrient\u2014Food or another substance that supplies the body with the elements needed for metabolism. Sugars\u2014Those carbohydrates having the general composition of one part carbon, two parts hydro- gen, and one part oxygen. and carried by the bloodstream into the lungs where it is exhaled. Normally there is very little hydrogen detectable in the breath, so its presence indicates faulty digestion of lactose. When lactose intolerance is suspected in infants and young children, many pediatricians recommend simply changing from cow\u2019s milk to soy formula and watching for improvement. If needed, a stool sample can be tested for acidity. The inadequate digestion of lactose will result in an increase of acid in the waste matter excreted by the bowels and the presence of glucose. Treatment Carbohydrate intolerance caused by temporary intestinal diseases disappears when the condition is suc- cessfully treated. In primary conditions, no treatment exists to improve the body\u2019s ability to produce the enzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet. Because the degree of lactose intolerance varies so much, treatment should be tailored for the individual. Young children showing signs of intolerance should avoid milk products; infants should switch to soy-based formula. Older children and adults can adjust their intake of lactose depending on how much and what they can tolerate. For some, a small glass of milk will not cause problems, while others may be able to handle ice cream or aged cheeses such as cheddar or Swiss, but not other dairy products. Generally, small amounts of lactose-con- taining foods taken throughout the day are better tolerat- ed than a large amount consumed all at once. For those individuals who are sensitive to even very small amounts of lactose, the lactase enzyme is available without a prescription. It comes in liquid form for use with milk. The addition of a few drops to a quart of milk will reduce the lactose content by 70% after 24 hours in the refrigerator. Heating the milk speeds up the process, and doubling the amount of lactase liquid will result in milk that is 90% lactose free. Chewable lactase enzyme tablets are also available. Three to six tablets taken before a meal or snack will aid in the digestion of solid foods. Lactose-reduced milk and other products are also available in stores. The milk contains the same nutrients as regular milk. Because dairy products are an important source of calcium, people who reduce or severely limit their intake of dairy products may need to consider other ways to consume an adequate amount of calcium in their diets. Prognosis With good dietary management, individuals with carbohydrate intolerance can lead normal lives. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 650 Carbohydrate intolerance",

The treatment includes changes in diet, oral medications, and in some cases, daily injections of insulin. Description Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes serious health complications including renal (kidney) failure, heart disease, stroke, and blindness. Approxi- mately 14 million Americans (about 5% of the popula- tion) have diabetes. Unfortunately, as many as one-half are unaware that they have it. Background Every cell in the human body needs energy in order to function. The body\u2019s primary energy source is glu- cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches). Glucose from the digested food circulates in the blood as a ready energy source for any cells that need it. Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell and acts like a key to open a doorway into the cell through which glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can be converted to concentrated energy sources like glycogen or fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is not enough insulin produced or when the doorway no longer recognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the blood rather entering the cells. The body will attempt to dilute the high level of glucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia, by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood- stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it in the urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnosed diabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities of water, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get rid of the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucose in the urine. At the same time that the body is trying to get rid of glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu- cose and sending signals to the body to eat more food, thus making patients extremely hungry. To provide energy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con- vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats and proteins for energy causes acid compounds called ketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also be excreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood, a condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi- tion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading to coma and death. Types of diabetes mellitus Type I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes, begins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. In this form of diabetes, the body produces little or no insulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occurs more frequently in populations descended from Northern European countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) than in those from Southern European countries, the Middle East, or Asia. In the United States, approximately three people in 1,000 develop Type I diabetes. This form is also called insulin-dependent diabetes because people who develop this type need to have daily injections of insulin. Brittle diabetics are a subgroup of Type I where patients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugar levels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there is too much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo- glycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev- els of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients may require several injections of different types of insulin during the day to keep the blood sugar level within a fair- ly normal range. The more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs in approximately 3\u20135% of Americans under 50 years of age, and increases to 10\u201315% in those over 50. More than 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type II diabetics. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset dia- betes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in people who are overweight and who do not exercise . It is also more common in people of Native American, Hispanic, and African-American descent. People who have migrat- ed to Western cultures from East India, Japan, and Aus- tralian Aboriginal cultures are also more likely to devel- op Type II diabetes than those who remain in their origi- nal countries. Type II is considered a milder form of diabetes because of its slow onset (sometimes developing over the course of several years) and because it can usually be controlled with diet and oral medication. The conse- quences of uncontrolled and untreated Type II diabetes, however, are the just as serious as those for Type I. This form is also called noninsulin-dependent diabetes, a term that is somewhat misleading. Many people with Type II diabetes can control the condition with diet and oral medications, however, insulin injections are sometimes necessary if treatment with diet and oral medication is not working. Another form of diabetes called gestational dia- betes can develop during pregnancy and generally resolves after the baby is delivered. This diabetic condi- tion develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy in about 2% of pregnancies.

Frey Famine fever see Relapsing fever Fanconi\u2019s syndrome Definition Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor- ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc- tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal- cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the body. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth. Description Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body needs in the blood and putting what the body doesn\u2019t need into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is performed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered through a kidney structure with small holes that keep the cells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of the small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body, are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome. As a consequence, substances that are normally reabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins, water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and phosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn- drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular syndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debr\u00e9-Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi\u2019s anemia is, however, a totally different disease. Causes and symptoms Causes Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be caused by a variety of genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults. The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause in children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease, hereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome, Wilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease, vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome. Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium, lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like outdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances (like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine taken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans- plantation. Symptoms Fanconi\u2019s syndrome symptoms related directly to impaired absorption include excessive urine production and urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa- tion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu- cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and protein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels of phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively acidic blood. The most noticeable indirect consequences of impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and osteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated with bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty walking. If a person acquires Fanconi\u2019s syndrome as an adult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is accompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac- tures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and occasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of the ineffective reabsorption. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be made by urine and blood tests. It is also important to find the underlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Other symptoms specific to a particular patient will point to other useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290 Fanconi\u2019s syndrome",

It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants. However, cough KEY TERMS Antitussives\u2014Drugs used to suppress coughing. Expectorant\u2014Drug used to thin mucus. Gastroesophageal reflux \u2014Condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Glottis\u2014The opening between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx. Larynx\u2014A part of the respiratory tract between the pharynx and the trachea, having walls of cartilage and muscle and containing the vocal cords. Sputum\u2014The mixture of mucus, irritants, and other substances expelled from the lungs by coughing. medicines may be given if the patient cannot rest because of the cough or if the cough is not productive, as is the case with most coughs associated with colds or flu. The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under- lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942 Cough",

Eliminating the substance most recently added should eliminate the irritation. If the origin of the irritation has still not been identi- fied, a dermatologist may perform one or more patch tests. This involves dabbing a small amount of a suspected irri- tant onto skin on the patient\u2019s back. If no irritation devel- ops within a few days, another patch test is performed. The process continues until the patient experiences an allergic reaction at the spot where the irritant was applied. Treatment Treating contact dermatitis begins with eliminating or avoiding the source of irritation. Prescription or over- the-counter corticosteroid creams can lessen inflamma- tion and relieve irritation. Creams, lotions, or ointments not specifically formulated for dermatitis can intensify the irritation. Oral antihistamines are sometimes recom- mended to alleviate itching, and antibiotics are pre- scribed if the rash becomes infected. Medications taken by mouth to relieve symptoms of dermatitis can make skin red and scaly and cause hair loss. KEY TERMS Allergic reaction\u2014An inappropriate or exaggerat- ed genetically determined reaction to a chemical that occurs only on the second or subsequent exposures to the offending agent, after the first contact has sensitized the body. Corticosteriod \u2014A group of synthetic hormones that are used to prevent or reduce inflammation. Toxic effects may result from rapid withdrawal after prolonged use or from continued use of large doses. Patch test\u2014A skin test that is done to identify aller- gens. A suspected substance is applied to the skin. After 24\u201348 hours, if the area is red and swollen, the test is positive for that substance. If no reaction occurs, another substance is applied. This is con- tinued until the patient experiences an allergic reaction where the irritant was applied to the skin. Rash\u2014A spotted, pink or red skin eruption that may be accompanied by itching and is caused by disease, contact with an allergen, food ingestion, or drug reaction. Ulcer\u2014An open sore on the skin, resulting from tissue destruction, that is usually accompanied by redness, pain, or infection. Patients who have a history of dermatitis should remove their rings before washing their hands. They should use bath oils or glycerine-based soaps and bathe in lukewarm saltwater. Patting rather than rubbing the skin after bathing and thoroughly massaging lubricating lotion or nonprescrip- tion cortisone creams into still-damp skin can soothe red, irritated nummular dermatitis. Highly concentrated corti- sone preparations should not be applied to the face, armpits, groin, or rectal area. Periodic medical monitoring is necessary to detect side effects in patients who use such preparations on rashes covering large areas of the body. Coal-tar salves can help relieve symptoms of num- mular dermatitis that have not responded to other treat- ments, but these ointments have an unpleasant odor and stain clothing. Patients who have stasis dermatitis should elevate their legs as often as possible and sleep with a pillow between the lower legs. Tar or zinc paste may also be used to treat stasis der- matitis. Because these compounds must remain in con- tact with the rash for as long as two weeks, the paste and bandages must be applied by a nurse or a doctor. Coal-tar shampoos may be used for seborrheic der- matitis that occurs on the scalp. Sun exposure after the use of these shampoos should be avoided because the risk of sunburn of the scalp is increased. Alternative treatment Some herbal therapies can be useful for skin condi- tions. Among the herbs most often recommended are: \u2022 Burdock root (Arctium lappa) \u2022 Calendula (Calendula officinalis) ointment \u2022 Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) ointment \u2022 Cleavers (Galium ssp.) \u2022 Evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis) \u2022 Nettles (Urtica dioica) Contact dermatitis can be treated botanically and homeopathically. Grindelia ( Grindelia spp.) and sas- safras ( Sassafras albidum ) can help when applied topi- cally. Determining the source of the problem and elimi- nating it is essential. Oatmeal baths are very helpful in relieving the itch. Bentonite clay packs or any mud pack draws the fluid out, and helps dry up the lesions. Corti- sone creams are not recommended. Stasis dermatitis should be treated by a trained prac- titioner. This condition responds well to topical herbal therapies, however, the cause must also be addressed.

There is no risk of infection from the agents injected, since they are purified antigens, not whole organisms. Life threaten- ing, hypersensitive reactions ( anaphylaxis ) are a very small risk; patients should notify the administering physician immediately if signs of wheezing, swelling, or diffuse redness of the skin develops. Normal results Absence of exposure to TB is indicated by absent or very little skin reaction; redness or hardness smaller than 5 mm (about 0.25 in) is considered normal for a person not exposed or infected with TB. Patch test sites should be normal or only slightly red. T cell responsiveness tests should be positive; that is, the injected areas should be reddened and hard. Two affect- ed areas of 2 mm or more is considered a positive result. Abnormal results TB exposure is indicated by a reaction of 10 mm or more. The degree of redness is not important. A 5\u201310 mm area could indicate exposure if there is an underlying risk to TB. Patch test areas that become reddened and irritated indicate reaction to the substance in the patch.

Antigen \u2014A foreign substance detected that pro- vokes an immune reaction. Absence of any reaction to injected areas indi- cates lack of T cell responsiveness, a condition called anergy. T cell anergy is seen in immune deficiency diseases including AIDS , some cases of infectious diseases, malignancies, immunosuppressive therapy (including corticosteroid treatment), some autoim- mune diseases, malnutrition, major surgery, and some viral immunizations.

Description Delirium is a syndrome, or group of symptoms, caused by a disturbance in the normal functioning of the brain. The delirious patient has a reduced awareness of and responsiveness to the environment, which may be manifested as disorientation, incoherence, and memory disturbance. Delirium is often marked by hallucinations, delusions, and a dream-like state. Delirium affects at least one in 10 hospitalized patients, and is a common part of many terminal illness- es. Delirium is more common in the elderly than in the general population. While it is not a specific disease itself, patients with delirium usually fare worse than those with the same illness who do not have delirium. Causes and symptoms Causes There are a large number of possible causes of delir- ium. Metabolic disorders are the single most common cause, accounting for 20\u201340% of all cases. This type of delirium, termed \u201cmetabolic encephalopathy,\u201d may result from organ failure, including liver or kidney failure. Other metabolic causes include diabetes mellitus , hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism , vitamin defi- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21020 Delirium",

Contact dermatitis can occur on any part of the body, but it usually affects the hands, feet, and groin. Contact dermatitis usually does not spread from one person to another, nor does it spread beyond the area exposed to the irritant unless affected skin comes into contact with another part of the body. However, in the case of some irritants, such as poison ivy, contact dermatitis can be passed to another person or to another part of the body. Stasis dermatitis is characterized by scaly, greasy looking skin on the lower legs and around the ankles. Sta- sis dermatitis is most apt to affect the inner side of the calf. Nummular dermatitis, which is also called nummular eczematous dermatitis or nummular eczema, generally affects the hands, arms, legs, and buttocks of men and women older than 55 years of age. This stubborn inflamed rash forms circular, sometimes itchy, patches and is characterized by flares and periods of inactivity. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by itching, scal- ing, swelling, and sometimes blistering. In early child- hood it is called infantile eczema and is characterized by redness, oozing, and crusting. It is usually found on the face, inside the elbows, and behind the knees. Seborrheic dermatitis may be dry or moist and is characterized by greasy scales and yellowish crusts on the scalp, eyelids, face, external surfaces of the ears, under- arms, breasts, and groin. In infants it is called \u201ccradle cap.\u201d Causes and symptoms Allergic reactions are genetically determined, and different substances cause contact dermatitis to develop in different people. A reaction to resin produced by poi- son ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac is the most com- mon source of symptoms. It is, in fact, the most common allergy in this country, affecting one of every two people in the United States. Flowers, herbs, and vegetables can also affect the skin of some people. Burns and sunburn increase the risk of dermatitis developing, and chemical irritants that can cause the condition include: \u2022 chlorine \u2022 cleansers \u2022 detergents and soaps \u2022 fabric softeners \u2022 glues used on artificial nails \u2022 perfumes \u2022 topical medications Contact dermatitis can develop when the first con- tact occurs or after years of use or exposure. Stasis dermatitis, a consequence of poor circulation, occurs when leg veins can no longer return blood to the heart as efficiently as they once did. When that happens, fluid collects in the lower legs and causes them to swell. Stasis dermatitis can also result in a rash that can break down into sores known as stasis ulcers. The cause of nummular dermatitis is not known, but it usually occurs in cold weather and is most common in people who have dry skin. Hot weather and stress can aggravate this condition, as can the following: \u2022 allergies \u2022 fabric softeners \u2022 soaps and detergents \u2022 wool clothing \u2022 bathing more than once a day Atopic dermatitis can be caused by allergies, asth- ma, or stress, and there seems to be a genetic predisposi- tion for atopic conditions. It is sometimes caused by an allergy to nickel in jewelry. Seborrheic dermatitis (for which there may also be a genetic predisposition) is usually caused by overproduc- tion of the oil glands. In adults it can be associated with diabetes mellitus or gold allergy. In infants and adults it may be caused by a biotin deficiency. Diagnosis The diagnosis of dermatitis is made on the basis of how the rash looks and its location. The doctor may scrape off a small piece of affected skin for microscopic examination or direct the patient to discontinue use of any potential irritant that has recently come into contact with GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1037 Dermatitis Dermatitis on hands and fingers.

Prognosis Dermatitis is often chronic, but symptoms can gen- erally be controlled. Prevention Contact dermatitis can be prevented by avoiding the source of irritation. If the irritant cannot be avoided com- pletely, the patient should wear gloves and other protec- tive clothing whenever exposure is likely to occur. Immediately washing the exposed area with soap and water can stem allergic reactions to poison ivy, poi- son oak, or poison sumac, but because soaps can dry the skin, patients susceptible to dermatitis should use them only on the face, feet, genitals, and underarms. Clothing should be loose fitting and 100% cotton. New clothing should be washed in dye-free, unscented detergent before being worn. Injury to the lower leg can cause stasis dermatitis to ulcerate (form open sores). If stasis ulcers develop, a doctor should be notified immediately. Yoga and other relaxation techniques may help pre- vent atopic dermatitis caused by stress. Avoidance of sweating may aid in preventing sebor- rheic dermatitis. A patient who has dermatitis should also notify a doctor if any of the following occurs: \u2022 fever develops \u2022 skin oozes or other signs of infection appear \u2022 symptoms do not begin to subside after seven days\u2019 treatment \u2022 he/she comes into contact with someone who has a wart, cold sore, or other viral skin infection Resources BOOKS The Editors of Time-Life Books.

Maureen Haggerty Dermatophyte infections see Ringworm DES exposure Definition DES (diethylstilbestrol) is a hormone that was pre- scribed for pregnant women in the 1950s and early 1960s. Many years later, doctors discovered that the daughters of the women who received DES were at high risk for a variety of problems, including infertility, pre- mature labor, and cancer of the vagina and cervix. Description In the 1950s and early 1960s, several drug compa- nies claimed that DES (diethylstilbestrol) could prevent miscarriages. DES is a synthetic hormone, related to estrogen. Since up to 20% of all pregnancies end in mis- carriage , this seemed like an important breakthrough and DES was prescribed for many women who had bleeding in early pregnancy. Ultimately, it was found to have no effect on miscarriages and the practice of pre- scribing DES was stopped in the 1960s. Almost 10 years later, the daughters of women who had taken DES during pregnancy began to develop unusual symptoms. Doctors discovered that when these young women reached their teens, they were at higher risk for a variety of problems, including: \u2022 clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix \u2022 infertility \u2022premature labor and other problems in pregnancy Causes and symptoms DES has affected a very specific group of women. These are women who were exposed to DES in utero before 18 weeks of pregnancy. In other words, their mothers must have taken DES within the first four to five months of pregnancy. It is now known that the female reproductive organs are formed during that time. DES GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1039 DES exposure",

In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last- ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn- drome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic- ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer appears to be the case. Precautions As in any blood test, standard precautions should be performed to prevent infection at the site where the blood is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally, the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the blood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and syringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres- sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped. Description These tests are more often performed in a consulting laboratory than at a physician\u2019s office or in a hospital laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the whole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can be detected against several components of the Epstein- Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif- ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages) of the virus\u2019 growth. At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus, antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six months only. This antibody, however, persists substan- tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti- body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV occurred in the past. Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA can be found. Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable amounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which might be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship very unlikely. Preparation The skin area from which the blood sample will be obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or iodine. Aftercare The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test. Usually, pressure is applied to the area for several moments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult to interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after waiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts of antibody detected between the two tests can be particu- larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis. Risks There are no risks over and above those of having blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are more expensive than many other blood tests but are usually covered by medical insurance. Normal results The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to determine whether the person has not had infection with EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current- ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or has had first time infection with EBV sometime in the past (more than six months ago). If one defines \u201cnormal\u201d results as either not having EBV in the past, and call that category one; or having had it in the past, and call that category two. Most young children below the age of five will fall into category one, while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into category two. The results for susceptibility are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative \u2022 antibody to EBNA = Negative The results for past infection are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative (90% of time) \u2022 antibody to VCA IgM = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA IgG = positive \u2022 antibody to EBNA = positive It is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus, like all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leave the body after the patient recovers from illness.

The symptoms can take many forms: redness, itching , crusting, swelling, blistering, oozing, dryness, scaliness, thicken- ing of the skin, and a feeling of warmth at the site of con- tact. In extreme cases, severe blistering can occur and open sores can form. Jobs that require frequent skin exposure to water, such as hairdressing and food prepara- tion, can make the skin more susceptible to ICD. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when repeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub- stance) triggers an immune response that inflames the skin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics, food additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub- stances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewer than 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACD cases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cosmet- ics and personal care products; latex items such as gloves and condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people find that they are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive jewelry. ACD is usually confined to the area of skin that comes in contact with the allergen, typically the hands or face. Symptoms range from mild to severe and resemble those of ICD; a patch test may be needed to determine which kind of con- tact dermatitis a person is suffering from. Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a physical examination and asking the patient questions about his or her health and daily activities. When contact dermatitis is suspected, the doctor attempts to learn as much as possible about the patient\u2019s hobbies, workplace duties, use of medications and cosmetics, etc.\u2014anything that might shed light on the source of the disease. In some cases, an examination of the home or workplace is undertaken. If the dermatitis is mild, responds well to treatment, and does not recur, ordinarily the investigation is at an end. More difficult cases require patch testing to identify the allergen. Two methods of patch testing are currently used. The most widely used method, the Finn chamber method, employs a multiwell, aluminum patch. Each well is filled with a small amount of the allergen being tested and the patch is taped to normal skin on the patient\u2019s upper back. After 48 hours, the patch is removed and an initial reading is taken. A second reading is made a few days later. The second method of patch testing involves applying a small amount of the test substance to directly to normal skin and covering it with a dressing that keeps air out and keeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing). After 48 hours, the dressing is taken off to see if a reaction has occurred. Identifying the allergen may require repeated testing, can take weeks or months, and is not always suc- cessful. Moreover, patch testing works only with ACD, though it is considered an essential step in ruling out ICD. Treatment The best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identify the allergen or irritating substance and avoid further con- tact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic, avoid- ance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such as an allergy to an essential workplace chemical for which no substitute can be found, avoidance may be impossible or force the sufferer to find new work or make other drastic changes in his or her life. Barrier creams and protective clothing such as gloves, masks, and long-sleeved shirts are ways of coping with contact dermatitis when avoidance is impossible, though they are not always effective. For the symptoms themselves, treatments in mild cases include cool compresses and nonprescription lotions and ointments. When the symptoms are severe, corticosteroids applied to the skin or taken orally are used. Contact dermatitis that leads to a bacterial skin infection is treated with antibiotics.

Maureen Haggerty Delavirdine see Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Delayed hypersensitivity skin test Definition A delayed hypersensitivity test (DHT) is an immune function test measuring the presence of activated T cells that recognize a certain substance. Purpose The immune system protects against infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial expo- sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys- tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Both these immune agents respond when the body is reex- posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulating proteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termed an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells\u2019 respons- es occur over several days, and are thus called delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat- ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red- ness (erythema) at the injection site. A DHT is performed for one of three reasons: \u2022 To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber- culosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting into the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con- tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provoke an immune response. \u2022 To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants, such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually done by placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con- taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub- stances. \u2022 To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of the evaluation of immune system health in infection, cancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen- ing, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict survival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu- ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens used for these tests must be ones the patient has been exposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivated antigens from common infectious agents to which the patient might have been exposed, such as mumps , Candida albicans , tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a skin fungus). Precautions No special precautions are necessary for most patients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certain skin irritants should alert the clinician performing the test. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigens contain mercury, a source of irritation to some patients. Description The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in which a small amount of TB antigen is injected into the skin. The area is examined 48\u201372 hours after the injection. In the patch test, 20\u201330 adhesive patches are usually placed on the upper back. The patches are kept in place and the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches are then removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after- ward, and possibly again a day or more following that. Patch testing is usually performed following a patient complaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance. Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying the right one requires careful review of the patient\u2019s possi- ble exposure. The test of overall T cell responsiveness is per- formed with several injections. Each area injected is cir- cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the injection. Preparation No special preparation is necessary. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1019 Delayed hypersensitivity skin test",

The herb elecampane may act as an expectorant to help patients clear mucus from the lungs. The patient should discuss these remedies with their health care practitioner prior to trying them, as some may interact with the more tradi- tional treatments that are already being used. Prognosis Emphysema is a serious and chronic disease that cannot be reversed. If detected early, the effects and progression can be slowed, particularly if the patient stops smoking immediately. Complications of emphy- sema include higher risks for pneumonia and acute bronchitis. Overall, the prognosis for patients with emphysema is poor, with a survival rate for all those with COPD of four years, and even less for emphyse- ma. However, individual cases vary and many patients can live much longer with supplemental oxygen and other treatment measures. Prevention The best way to prevent emphysema is to avoid smoking. Even patients with inherited emphysema should avoid smoking, as it especially worsens the onset and severity. If patients quit smoking as soon as evidence of small airway obstruction begins, they can significantly improve their prognosis. Resources BOOKS Beers, Mark H., and Robert Berkow, eds.

The name comes from the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing (suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to col- lections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cav- ity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in the gall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema in the pleural cavity is sometimes called empyema thoracis, or empye- ma of the chest, to distinguish it from empyema else- where in the body. Description Empyema may have a number of causes but is most frequently a complication of pneumonia . Its develop- ment can be divided into three phases: an acute phase in which the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containing some pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens and a fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumu- late within the cavity; and a third or chronic stage in which the lung or other organ is encased within a thick covering of fibrous material. Causes and symptoms Empyema thoracis can be caused by a number of dif- ferent organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and amebas, in connection with pneumonia, chest wounds, chest surgery, lung abscesses, or a ruptured esophagus. The infective organism can get into the pleural cavity either through the bloodstream or other circulatory system, in secretions from lung tissue, or on the surfaces of surgical instruments or objects that cause open chest wounds. The most com- mon organisms that cause empyema are the following bac- teria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureusis the most common cause in all age groups, accounting for 90% of cases of empyema in infants and children. Pelvic empyema in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1175 Empyema",

Antibiotics are frequently given at the first sign of a respiratory infection, such as increased spu- tum production or a change in color of sputum from clear to yellow or green. \u2022 Vaccines. To prevent pulmonary infection from viruses and bacteria, people with COPD should be vaccinated against influenza each year at least six weeks before flu season and have a one-time pneumococcal ( pneu- monia) vaccine. \u2022 Expectorants.

          "content": "Initially, a patient may only notice shortness of breath when he or she is exercising. However, as the disease pro- gresses, it will occur with less exertion or no exertion at all. Emphysema patients may also develop an enlarged, or \u201cbarrel,\u201d chest. Other symptoms may be skipped breaths, difficulty sleeping, morning headaches, increased diffi- culty breathing while lying down, chronic fatigue, and swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs. Those with emphyse- ma are at risk for a variety of other complications result- ing from weakened lung function, including pneumonia. Diagnosis A variety of pulmonary function tests may be ordered. In the early stages of emphysema, the only result may be dysfunction of the small airways. Patients with emphysema may show an increase in the total amount of air that is in the lungs (total lung capacity), but a decrease in the amount of air that can be breathed out after taking a deep breath (vital capacity). With severe emphysema, vital capacity is substantially below normal. Spirometry, a procedure that measures air flow and lung volume, helps in the diagnosis of emphysema. A chest x ray is often ordered to aid in the diagnosis of emphysema, though patients in the early stages of the disease may have normal findings. Abnormal findings on the chest x ray include over-inflation of the lungs and an abnormally increased chest diameter. The diaphragm may appear depressed or flattened. In addition, patients with advanced emphysema may show a smaller or vertical heart. The physician may observe blisters in the lungs and bulging of the accessory muscles of the respiratory sys- tem. Late in the disease, an EKG will show signs of right ventricular failure in the heart and increased hemoglobin due to lower levels of oxygen in the patient\u2019s blood. Treatment Treatment methods for emphysema do not cure or reverse the damage to the lungs. However, they may slow the progression of the disease, relieve symptoms, and help control possibly fatal complications. The first step in treatment for smokers is to quit, so as to prevent any further deterioration of breathing ability. Smoking cessa- tion programs may be effective. Consistent encourage- ment along with the help of health care professionals as well as family and friends can help increase the success rate of someone attempting to quit. If the patient and the health care team develop and maintain a complete program of respiratory care, disabil- ity can be decreased, acute episodes of illness may be prevented, and the number of hospitalizations reduced. However, only quitting smoking has been shown to slow down the progression of the disease, and among all other treatments, only oxygen therapy has shown an increase in the survival rate. Home oxygen therapy may improve the survival times in those patients with advanced emphysema who also have low blood oxygen levels. It may improve the patient\u2019s tolerance of exercise, as well as improve their performance in certain aspects of brain function and muscle coordination. The functioning of the heart may also improve with an increased concentration of oxygen in the blood. Oxygen may also decrease insomnia and headaches. Some patients may only receive oxygen at night, but studies have illustrated that it is most effective when administered at least 18, but preferably 24 hours per day. Portable oxygen tanks prescribed to patients carry a limited supply and must be refilled on a regular basis by a home health provider. Medicare and most insurance companies cover a large proportion of the cost of home oxygen therapy. Patients should be instructed regarding special safety issues involving the transport and presence of oxygen in the home. A variety of medications may be used in the treat- ment of emphysema. Usually the patient responds best to a combination of medicines, rather than one single drug. Bronchodilators are sometimes used to help alle- viate the patient\u2019s symptoms by relaxing and opening the airways. They can be inhaled, taken by mouth, or injected.

Purpose In the United States, circumcision in infant boys is performed for social, medical, or cultural/religious rea- sons. Once a routine operation urged by pediatricians and obstetricians for newborns in the middle of the twen- tieth century, circumcision has become an elective option that parents make for their sons on an individual basis. Families who practice Judaism or Islam may select to have their sons circumcised as a religious practice. Oth- ers choose circumcision for medical benefits. Female circumcision (also known as female genital mutilation) is usually performed for cultural and social reasons by family members and others who are not mem- bers of the medical profession, with no anesthesia. Not only is the prepuce removed but often the vaginal open- ing is sewn to make it smaller. This practice is supposed to ensure the virginity of a bride on her wedding day. It also prevents the woman from achieving sexual pleasure during coitus. This practice is not universally approved by the medical profession and is considered by some as a human rights violation. Though the incidence of male circumcision has decreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still the most common surgical operation in the United States. Circumcision rates are much lower for the rest of the industrialized world. In Britain, it is only done for reli- gious practices or to correct a specific medical condition of the penis. Some of the medical reasons parents choose cir- cumcision are to protect against infections of the uri- nary tract and the foreskin, prevent cancer , lower the risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases , and pre- vent phimosis (a tightening of the foreskin that may close the opening of the penis).

Some patients\u2019 lung function improves with corticosteroids, and inhaled steroids may be beneficial to patients with few side effects. A variety of antibiotics are frequently given at the first sign of a respiratory infection, such as increased amounts of spu- tum, or if there has been a change in the color of the sputum. Expectorants can help to loosen respiratory secretions, enabling the patient to more easily expel them from the airways. Many of the medications prescribed involve the use of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) that may require special instruction to be used correctly. MDIs are a convenient and safe method of delivering medication to the lungs. However, if they are used incorrectly the medication will not get to the right place. Proper technique is essential for the medication to be effective. For some patients, surgical treatment may be the best option. Lung volume reduction surgery is a surgical procedure in which the most diseased parts of the lung are removed to enable the remaining lung and breathing muscles to work more efficiently. Preliminary studies suggest improved survival rates and better functioning with the surgery. Another surgical procedure used for emphysema patients is lung transplantation . Trans- plantation may involve one or both lungs. However, it is a risky and expensive procedure, and donor organs may not be available. For those patients with advanced emphysema, keep- ing the air passages reasonably clear of secretions can prove difficult. Some common methods for mobilizing and removing secretions include: \u2022 Postural drainage. This helps to remove secretions from the airways. The patient lies in a position that allows gravity to aid in draining different parts of the lung. This is often done after the patient inhales an aerosol medication. The basic position involves the patient lying on the bed with his chest and head over the side and the forearms resting on the floor. \u2022 Chest percussion. This technique involves lightly clap- ping the back and chest, and may help to loosen thick secretions. \u2022 Coughing and deep breathing. These techniques may aid the patient in bringing up secretions. \u2022 Aerosol treatments. These treatments may involve solu- tions of saline, often mixed with a bronchodilator, which are then inhaled as an aerosol. The aerosols thin and loosen secretions. A treatment normally takes 10 to 15 minutes, and is given three or four times a day. Patients with COPD can learn to perform a variety of self-help measures that may help improve their symp- toms and their ability to participate in everyday activi- ties. These measures include: \u2022 Avoiding any exposure to dusts and fumes. \u2022 Avoiding air pollution, including the cigarette smoke of others. \u2022 Avoiding other people who have infections like the cold or flu. Get a pneumonia vaccination and a yearly flu shot. \u2022 Drinking plenty of fluids. This helps to loosen respira- tory secretions so they can be brought up more easily through coughing. \u2022 Avoiding extreme temperatures of heat or cold. Also avoiding high altitudes. (Special precautions can be taken that may enable the emphysema patient to fly on a plane.) \u2022 Maintaining adequate nutritional intake. Normally a high protein diet taken in many small feedings is rec- ommended. Alternative treatment Many patients are interested in whether any alterna- tive treatments for emphysema are available. Some prac- titioners recommend supplements of antioxidant nutri- ents.

Lori De Milto EMG see Electromyography Emollient bath see Therapeutic baths Emphysema Definition Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease where there is over-inflation of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, causing a decrease in lung function, and often, breathlessness. Description Emphysema is the most common cause of death from respiratory disease in the United States, and is the fourth most common cause of death overall. There are 1.8 million Americans with the disease, which ranks fif- teenth among chronic conditions that cause limitations of activity. The disease is usually caused by smoking, but a small number of cases are caused by an inherited defect. Normally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently expanding and recoiling as air passes freely through the bronchus to the alveoli, where oxygen is moved into the blood and carbon dioxide is filtered out. When a person inhales cigarette smoke or certain other irritants, his or her immune system responds by releasing substances that are meant to defend the lungs against the smoke. These substances can also attack the cells of the lungs, but the body normally inhibits such action with the release of other substances. In smokers and those with the inherited defect, however, no such prevention occurs and the lung tissue is damaged in such a way that it loses its elasticity. The small passageways (bronchioles) lead- ing to the alveoli collapse, trapping air within the alveoli. The alveoli, unable to recoil efficiently and move the air out, over expand and rupture. As the disease progresses, coughing and shortness of breath occur. In the later stages, the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the blood. Emphysema often occurs with other respiratory diseases, particularly chronic bronchitis. These two dis- eases are often referred to as one disorder called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema is most common among people aged 50 and older. Those with inherited emphysema may experience the onset as early as their thirties or fourties Men are more likely than women to develop emphysema, but female cases are increasing as the number of female smokers rises. Causes and symptoms Heavy cigarette smoking causes about 80\u201390% of all emphysema cases. However a few cases are the result of an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1- antitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with this deficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than 70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can also damage the lungs. While a person may be less likely to inhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke can also impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be even more damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held in by the smoker. The symptoms of emphysema develop gradually over many years. It is a common occurrence for many emphysema patients to have lost over half of their func- tioning lung tissue before they become aware that some- thing is wrong. Shortness of breath, a chronic mild cough (which may be productive of large amounts of dark, thick sputum, and often dismissed as \u201csmoker\u2019s cough\u201d), and sometimes weight loss are associated with emphysema.

Cold sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus infection. Description A cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is usually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold sore are fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi- alis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur on the lips which distinguishes them from the common canker sore, which is usually inside the mouth. Cold sores do not usually occur inside the mouth except dur- ing the initial episode. Canker sores usually form either on the tongue or inside the cheeks. Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are eight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only two of these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause cold sores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virus type 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virus type 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely true. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her- pes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent cold sores are almost always type 1. Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of Americans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% of those infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most of these persons became infected before age 10. Anyone can become infected by herpes virus and, once infected, the virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses are spread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin con- tact. The highest risk for spreading the virus is the time period beginning with the appearance of blisters and end- ing with scab formation. However, infected persons need not have visible blisters to spread the infection to others since the virus may be present in the saliva without obvi- ous oral lesions. Viruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria are independent and can reproduce on their own, viruses enter human cells and force them to make more virus. The infected human cell is usually killed and releases thou- sands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tissue damage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, the her- pes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cell produce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits. The herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This is called \u201clatency.\u201d A latent virus can wait inside the nervous system for days, months, or even years. At some future time, the virus \u201cawakens\u201d and causes the cell to produce thousands of new viruses that cause an active infection. This process of latency and active infection is best understood by considering the cold sore cycle. An active infection is obvious because cold sores are present. The first infection is called the \u201cprimary\u201d infection. This active infection is then controlled by the body\u2019s immune system and the sores heal. In between active infections, the virus is latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses become activated and once again cause sores. These are called \u201crecurrent\u201d infections. Although it is unknown what trig- gers latent virus to activate, several conditions seem to bring on infections. These include stress, illness, tired- ness, exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet. Causes and symptoms While anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not everyone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of herpes occur within two-20 days after contact with an infected person. Symptoms of the primary infection are usually more severe than those of recurrent infections. The primary infection can cause symptoms like other viral infections including tiredness, headache, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Typically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe- rience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of pain, burning, itching, or tingling at the site where blis- ters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywhere from a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec- tion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection and recurrent infections. In 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters occur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the \u201cvermilion border.\u201d Less often, blisters form on the nose, chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the disease process is rapid. First, small red bumps appear that quickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters may either burst and form a scab or dry up and form a scab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis- ters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely and without scarring within six to ten days. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 844 Cold sore",

          "content": "Description Canker sores occur on the inside of the mouth, usu- ally on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and/or soft palate. They can also occur on the tongue and in the throat. Often, several canker sores will appear at the same time and may be grouped in clusters. Canker sores appear as a whitish, round area with a red border. The sores are painful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore is about one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa- sionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious. Approximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect- ed with recurring canker sores, and more women than men get them. Women are more likely to have canker sores during their premenstrual period. Canker sores are sometimes confused with cold sores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus. This disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters, can occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her- pes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and the gums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth. Cold sores are infectious. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev- er, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac- tion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma to the affected areas from toothbrush scrapes, stress, hor- mones, and food allergies . Canker sores tend to appear in response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling or mildly painful itching sensation in the area where the sore will appear. After one to several days, a small red swelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitish color with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a red ring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The main symptom is pain. Canker sores can be very painful, espe- cially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue. They last for one to two weeks. KEY TERMS Inflammation\u2014A local reaction to tissue injury or damage, usually characterized by pain, swelling, and redness. Sore\u2014A wound, lesion, or ulcer on the skin. Ulcer\u2014A site of damage to the skin or mucous membrane that is characterized by the formation of pus, death of tissue, and is frequently accompa- nied by an inflammatory reaction. Diagnosis Canker sores are diagnosed by observation of the blister. A distinction between canker sores and cold sores must be made because cold sores are infectious and the herpes infection can be transmitted to other people. The two sores can usually be distinguished visually and there are specific diagnostic tests for herpes infection. Treatment Since canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is not usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topi- cal anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of the sores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimes speeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods can help reduce the pain associated with canker sores. Alternative treatment Alternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at healing existing sores and preventing their recurrence. Several herbal remedies, including calendula (Calendula officinalis ), myrrh ( Commiphora molmol ), and gold- enseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), may be helpful in the treatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teas made from these herbs are applied directly to the sores. The tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the sores when the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking dan- delion ( Taraxacum officinale ) tea or capsules may help heal sores and also prevent future outbreaks. Since canker sores are often brought on by stress, such stress- relieving techniques as meditation , guided imagery , and certain acupressure exercises may help prevent canker sores or lessen their severity. Prognosis There is no cure for canker sores. They do not get larger or occur more frequently with age. Resources BOOKS Larsen, D. E., ed.

          "content": "Some children have a very serious primary (first episode) herpes infection called \u201cgingivostomatitis.\u201d This causes fever, swollen lymph glands, and numerous blis- ters inside the mouth and on the lips and tongue that may form large, open sores. These painful sores may last up to three weeks and can make eating and drinking diffi- cult. Because of this, young children with gingivostom- atitis are at risk for dehydration (excessive loss of water from the body). Most people experience fewer than two recurrent outbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people never experience outbreaks, while some have very frequent outbreaks. In most people, the blisters form in the same area each time and are triggered by the same factors (such as stress, sun exposure, etc). Diagnosis Because oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed primarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treated by the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who spe- cialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease special- ists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for the virus. Because healing sores do not shed much virus, a sample from an open sore would be taken for viral cul- ture. A sterile cotton swab would be wiped over open sores and the sample used to infect human cells in cul- ture. Cells that are killed by the herpes virus have a cer- tain appearance under microscopic examination. The results of this test are available within two to 10 days. Oral herpes may resemble a bacterial infection called impetigo. This skin infection is most commonly seen in children and causes herpes-like blisters around the mouth and nose. Also, because oral herpes can occur inside the mouth, the blisters could be mistaken for common canker sores. Therefore, the doctor would need to determine whether the blisters are oral herpes, canker sores, or impetigo. The diagnosis and treatment of herpes infec- tions should be covered by most insurance providers. Treatment There is no cure for herpes virus infections. There are antiviral drugs available that have some effect on lessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her- pes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre- vent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs work by interfering with the replication of the viruses, and are most effective when taken as early in the infection process as possible. For the best results, drug treatment should begin during the prodrome stage before blisters are visible. Depending on the length of the outbreak, drug treatment could continue for up to 10 days. Acyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes infection and can be given intravenously or taken by mouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointment but is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for chil- dren is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treating both the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks. When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovir reduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks. During an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores should be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day with warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the- counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol (such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbing ointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandage may be placed over the sores to protect them and prevent spreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) may be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever. Alternative treatment Vitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have an effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores. In general, cold sore sufferers should eat a healthy diet of unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Alcohol, caffeine, and sugar should be avoided. An imbalance in the amino acids lysine and arginine is thought to be one contributing factor in herpes virus out- breaks. A diet that is rich in the amino acid lysine may help prevent recurrences of cold sores. Foods which con- tain high levels of lysine include most vegetables, legumes, fish, turkey, and chicken. In one study, patients taking lysine supplements had milder symptoms during an outbreak, a shorter healing time, and had fewer outbreaks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 845 Cold sore A close-up view of a patient\u2019s mouth with gingivostomatitis cold sores.

Patients should take 1,000 mg of lysine three times a day during a cold sore outbreak and 500 mg daily on an ongoing basis to prevent recurrences. Intake of the amino acid arginine should be reduced. Foods rich in arginine that should be avoided are chocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds. Vitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits that helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) have been shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreak and reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B complex includes important vitamins that support the nervous sys- tem where viruses can hide out. B complex vitamins can also help manage stress, an important contributing factor to the outbreak of herpes viruses. Applying the oil in vita- min E capsules directly to cold sores may provide relief. Zinc lozenges appear to affect the reproduction of viruses and also enhance the immune system. Ointments contain- ing lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ) or licorice ( Gly- cyrrhiza glabra) and peppermint (Mentha piperita) have been shown to help cold sores heal. Prognosis Oral herpes can be painful and embarrassing, but it is not a serious infection. There is no cure for oral herpes, but outbreaks usually occur less frequently after age 35. The spread of the herpes virus to the eyes is very serious. The herpes virus can infect the cells in the cornea and cause scarring that may impair vision. Prevention The only way to prevent oral herpes is to avoid con- tact with infected persons. This is not an easy solution because many people aren\u2019t aware that they are infected and can easily infect others. Currently there are no her- pes vaccines available, although herpes vaccines are being tested. KEY TERMS Latent\u2014A nonactive virus which is in a dormant state within a cell. The herpes virus is latent in the nervous system. Prodrome\u2014The Symptoms that warn of the begin- ning of disease. The herpes prodrome consists of pain, burning, tingling, or itching at a site before blisters are visible. Recurrence\u2014The return of an active infection fol- lowing a period of latency. Several practices can reduce the occurrence of cold sores and the spread of virus to other body locations or people. These practices are: \u2022 Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting prolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to the face and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with a large brim is also helpful. \u2022 Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or pinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to other parts of the lips or face and infect those sites. \u2022 Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should wash their hands carefully before touching others. An infected person can spread the virus to others even when he or she has no obvious blisters. \u2022 Avoid contact with others during active infection. Infected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contact with others until after the cold sores have healed. \u2022 Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child\u2019s sore. \u2022 Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes or lips of a baby who is under six months old. \u2022 Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected children to share toys that may be put into the mouth. Toys that have been mouthed should be disinfected before other children play with them. \u2022 Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty of sleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of get- ting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on cold sores. Also, good general health keeps the immune sys- tem strong; this helps to keep the virus in check and prevents outbreaks. Resources BOOKS Gorbach, Sherman, John Bartlett, and Neil Blacklow, eds.

          "content": "Colds make the upper respiratory system less resis- tant to bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infection may lead to middle ear infection, bronchitis , pneumo- nia, sinus infection, or strep throat. People with chronic lung disease, asthma, diabetes, or a weakened immune system are more likely to develop these complications. Causes and symptoms Colds are caused by more than 200 different viruses. The most common groups are rhinoviruses and coron- aviruses. Different groups of viruses are more infectious at different seasons of the year, but knowing the exact virus causing the cold is not important in treatment. People with colds are contagious during the first two to four days of the infection. Colds pass from person to person in several ways. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks, tiny fluid droplets containing the virus are expelled. If these are breathed in by other people, the virus may establish itself in their noses and airways. Colds may also be passed through direct contact. If a person with a cold touches his runny nose or watery eyes, then shakes hands with another person some of the virus is transferred to the uninfected person. If that person then touches his mouth, nose, or eyes, the virus is transferred to an environment where it can reproduce and cause a cold. Finally, cold viruses can be spread through inani- mate objects (door knobs, telephones, toys) that become contaminated with the virus. This is a common method of transmission in child care centers. If a child with a cold touches his runny nose, then plays with a toy, some of the virus may be transferred to the toy. When another child plays with the toy a short time later, he may pick up some of the virus on his hands. The second child then touches his contaminated hands to his eyes, nose, or mouth and transfers some of the cold virus to himself. Once acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the lining of the nasal passages and sinuses. This causes the infected cells to release a chemical called histamine. His- tamine increases the blood flow to the infected cells, causing swelling, congestion, and increased mucus pro- duction. Within one to three days the infected person begins to show cold symptoms. The first cold symptoms are a tickle in the throat, runny nose, and sneezing. The initial discharge from the nose is clear and thin. Later it changes to a thick yellow or greenish discharge. Most adults do not develop a fever when they catch a cold. Young children may develop a low fever of up to 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C). In addition to a runny nose and fever, signs of a cold include coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion, headache, muscle ache, chills, sore throat , hoarseness, watery eyes, tiredness, and lack of appetite. The cough that accompanies a cold is usually intermittent and dry. Most people begin to feel better four to five days after their cold symptoms become noticeable. All symp- toms are generally gone within ten days, except for a dry cough that may linger for up to three weeks. Colds make people more susceptible to bacterial infections such as strep throat, middle ear infections, and sinus infections. A person whose cold does not begin to improve within a week; or who experiences chest pain, fever for more than a few days, difficulty breathing, bluish lips or fingernails, a cough that brings up green- ish-yellow or grayish sputum, skin rash, swollen glands, or whitish spots on the tonsils or throat should consult a doctor to see if they have acquired a secondary bacterial infection that needs to be treated with an antibiotic. People who have emphysema, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system\u2014either from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of medications, ( corticosteroids , chemotherapy drugs)\u2014 should consult their doctor if they get a cold. People with these health problems are more likely to get a secondary infection. Diagnosis Colds are diagnosed by observing a person\u2019s symp- toms. There are no laboratory tests readily available to detect the cold virus. However, a doctor may do a throat culture or blood test to rule out a secondary infection. Influenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but flu causes much more severe symptoms and generally a fever. Allergies to molds or pollens also can make the nose run. Allergies are usually more persistent than the common cold. An allergist can do tests to determine if the cold-like symptoms are being caused by an allergic reaction. Also, some people get a runny nose when they go outside in winter and breathe cold air. This type of runny nose is not a symptom of a cold. Treatment There are no medicines that will cure the common cold. Given time, the body\u2019s immune system will make antibodies to fight the infection, and the cold will be resolved without any intervention. Antibiotics are use- less against a cold. However, a great deal of money is spent by pharmaceutical companies in the United States promoting products designed to relieve cold symptoms. These products usually contain antihistamines , decon- gestants, and/or pain relievers. Antihistamines block the action of the chemical hist- amine that is produced when the cold virus invades the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 870 Common cold",

A contrast solution is injected into a foot vein through a catheter. The physician observes the movement of the solution through the vein with a fluoroscope while a series of x rays are taken. Venography takes between 30\u201345 minutes and can be done in a physician\u2019s office, a laboratory, or a hospital. Radionuclide venography, in which a radioactive isotope is injected, is occasionally used, especially if a patient has had reactions to contrast solutions. Venous ultra- sound is the preferred evaluation of leg veins. Treatment Patients with emboli require immediate hospitaliza- tion. They are generally treated with clot-dissolving and/or clot-preventing drugs. Thrombolytic therapy to dissolve blood clots is the definitive treatment for a very severe pulmonary embolism. Streptokinase, urokinase, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) are used. Heparin is the anticoagulant drug of choice for pre- venting formation of blood clots. Warfarin, an oral anti- coagulant, is sometimes used concurrently and is usually continued after the hospitalization. In the case of an arterial embolism, the affected limb is placed in a dependent position and kept warm. Embolectomy is the treatment of choice in the majority of early cases of arterial emboli in the extremities. In this procedure, a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into the artery to remove thromboembolic matter. With a pulmonary embolism, oxygen therapy is often used to maintain normal oxygen concentrations. For people who can\u2019t take anticoagulants and in some other cases, surgery may be needed to insert a device that filters blood returning to the heart and lungs. Prognosis Of patients hospitalized with an arterial embolism, 25\u201330% die, and 5\u201325% require amputation of a limb. About 10% of patients with a pulmonary embolism die suddenly within the first hour of onset of the condition. The outcome for all other patients is generally good; only 3% of patients die who are properly diagnosed early and treated. In cases of an undiagnosed pulmonary embolism, about 30% of patients die. Prevention Embolism can be prevented in high risk patients through antithrombotic drugs such as heparin, venous interruption, gradient elastic stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression of the legs. The combination of KEY TERMS Anticoagulants \u2014Drugs that suppress, delay, or prevent blood clots. Anticoagulants are used to treat embolisms. Artery\u2014A blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to other body tissues. Embolisms obstruct arteries. Deep vein thrombosis \u2014A blood clot in the calf\u2019s deep vein. This frequently leads to pulmonary embolism if untreated. Emboli\u2014Clots or other substances that travel through the blood stream and get stuck in an artery, blocking circulation. Thrombolytics \u2014Drugs that dissolve blood clots. Thrombolytics are used to treat embolisms. graduated compression stockings and low-dose heparin is significantly more effective than low-dose heparin alone. Gradient elastic stockings, also called anti-embolism stockings, decrease the risk of blood clots by compress- ing superficial leg veins and forcing blood into the deep veins. They can be knee-, thigh-, or waist-length. Many physicians order the use of stockings before surgery and until there is no longer an elevated risk of developing blood clots. The risk of deep vein thrombosis after surgery is reduced 50% with the use of these stockings. The American Heart Association recommends that the use of graduated compression stockings be considered for all high-risk surgical patients. Intermittent pneumatic compression involves wrap- ping knee- or thigh-high cuffs around the legs to prevent blood clots. The cuffs are connected to a pump which inflates and deflates, mimicking the heart\u2019s normal pump- ing action and reducing the pooling of blood. Intermittent pneumatic compression can be used during surgery and recovery and continues until there is no longer an elevated risk of developing blood clots. The American Heart Asso- ciation recommends the use of intermittent pneumatic compression for patients who cannot take anticoagulants, for example, spinal cord and brain trauma patients.

          "content": "of antibiotics. It is important to give antibiotics as soon as possible to prevent first-stage empyema from progress- ing to its later stages. The antibiotics most commonly used are penicillin and vancomycin. Patients experiencing difficulty breathing are also given oxygen therapy. Surgical treatment of empyema has two goals: drainage of the infected fluid and closing up of the space left in the pleural cavity. If the infection is still in its early stages, the fluid can be drained by thoracentesis. In sec- ond-stage empyema, the surgeon will insert a chest tube in the patient\u2019s rib cage or remove part of a rib (rib resection) in order to drain the fluid. In third-stage empyema, the sur- geon may cut or peel away the thick fibrous layer coating the lung. This procedure is called decortication. When the fibrous covering is removed, the lung will expand to fill the space in the chest cavity. The doctor can use video- assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) techniques to position the chest tube or to perform a limited decortication. The V ATS technique allows a physician to see within the body during certain surgical procedures. Empyema of the gall- bladder is a serious condition that is treated with intra- venous antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Prognosis The prognosis for recovery is generally good, except in those cases with complications, such as a brain abscess or blood poisoning , or cases caused by certain types of streptococci.

Frey Enalapril see Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors Encephalitis Definition Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, usually caused by a direct viral infection or a hypersensitivity reaction to a virus or foreign protein. Brain inflammation caused by a bacterial infection is sometimes called cerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord are involved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. An inflammation of the brain\u2019s covering, or meninges, is called meningitis. Description Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The inflammation is a reaction of the body\u2019s immune system to infection or invasion. During the inflammation, the brain\u2019s tissues become swollen. The combination of the infection and the immune reaction to it can cause headache and a fever, as well as more severe symptoms in some cases. Approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are reported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitis can be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi- demic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis is responsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. The viruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmit the disease. The most common form of non-epidemic or sporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death. Mumps is another example of a sporadic cause. Causes and symptoms Causes There are more than a dozen viruses that can cause encephalitis, spread by either human-to human contact or by animal bites. Encephalitis may occur with several common viral infections of childhood. Viruses and viral diseases that may cause encephalitis include: \u2022 chickenpox \u2022 measles \u2022 mumps \u2022 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1177 Encephalitis",

Lori De Milto EMG see Electromyography Emollient bath see Therapeutic baths Emphysema Definition Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease where there is over-inflation of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, causing a decrease in lung function, and often, breathlessness. Description Emphysema is the most common cause of death from respiratory disease in the United States, and is the fourth most common cause of death overall. There are 1.8 million Americans with the disease, which ranks fif- teenth among chronic conditions that cause limitations of activity. The disease is usually caused by smoking, but a small number of cases are caused by an inherited defect. Normally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently expanding and recoiling as air passes freely through the bronchus to the alveoli, where oxygen is moved into the blood and carbon dioxide is filtered out. When a person inhales cigarette smoke or certain other irritants, his or her immune system responds by releasing substances that are meant to defend the lungs against the smoke. These substances can also attack the cells of the lungs, but the body normally inhibits such action with the release of other substances. In smokers and those with the inherited defect, however, no such prevention occurs and the lung tissue is damaged in such a way that it loses its elasticity. The small passageways (bronchioles) lead- ing to the alveoli collapse, trapping air within the alveoli. The alveoli, unable to recoil efficiently and move the air out, over expand and rupture. As the disease progresses, coughing and shortness of breath occur. In the later stages, the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the blood. Emphysema often occurs with other respiratory diseases, particularly chronic bronchitis. These two dis- eases are often referred to as one disorder called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema is most common among people aged 50 and older. Those with inherited emphysema may experience the onset as early as their thirties or fourties Men are more likely than women to develop emphysema, but female cases are increasing as the number of female smokers rises. Causes and symptoms Heavy cigarette smoking causes about 80\u201390% of all emphysema cases. However a few cases are the result of an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1- antitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with this deficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than 70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can also damage the lungs. While a person may be less likely to inhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke can also impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be even more damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held in by the smoker. The symptoms of emphysema develop gradually over many years. It is a common occurrence for many emphysema patients to have lost over half of their func- tioning lung tissue before they become aware that some- thing is wrong. Shortness of breath, a chronic mild cough (which may be productive of large amounts of dark, thick sputum, and often dismissed as \u201csmoker\u2019s cough\u201d), and sometimes weight loss are associated with emphysema.

Common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: \u2022 labored breathing, sometimes accompanied by chest pain \u2022 a rapid pulse \u2022a cough that may produce sputum \u2022 a low-grade fever \u2022 fluid build-up in the lungs Less common symptoms include: \u2022 coughing up blood \u2022 pain caused by movement or breathing \u2022 leg swelling \u2022 bluish skin \u2022 fainting \u2022 swollen neck veins Symptoms of an arterial embolism include: \u2022 severe pain in the area of the embolism \u2022 pale, bluish cool skin \u2022 numbness \u2022 tingling \u2022 muscular weakness or paralysis Diagnosis An embolism can be diagnosed through the patient\u2019s history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For arterial emboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography are ordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray, lung scan, pulmonary angiography , electrocardiography , arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or venous ultrasound could be ordered. Diagnosing an arterial embolism Ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer then presses it against the patient\u2019s body. The ultrasound\u2019s sound waves arteries are converted into an image that can be displayed on a moni- tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30\u201360 minutes. An arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi- um is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. It can be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or diagnostic center of a hospital. Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism A chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect other respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan shows poor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. The patient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceutical and pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with a gamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical is injected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned. A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonary embolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital or an outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes. Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used often because it is expensive, invasive, and not readily available in most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographic test which involves injection of a radio contrast agent to show the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera records the blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul- monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital\u2019s radiology medicine department and takes 30\u201360 minutes. An electrocardiograph shows the heart\u2019s electrical activity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolism from a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient\u2019s chest, arms, and legs. Impulses of the heart\u2019s activity are traced on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes. Arterial blood gas measurements are sometimes helpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonary embolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of a vein, usually in the wrist. Venography is used to look for the most likely source of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis. It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it is painful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high dose of radiation, and can cause complications.

Pulmonary embolism can be very serious and, in some cases, fatal. Thrombosis \u2014The development of a blood clot inside a blood vessel. Doppler ultrasonography is usually the preferred procedure for detecting deep vein thrombosis. This tech- nique uses sound waves to measure blood flow through leg veins and arteries. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around the patient\u2019s ankle and a transducer with gel on it is placed over pulse points of the foot and lower leg. High-frequency sounds bounce off the soft tissue, and the echoes are converted into images on a monitor. It is very accurate in detecting clots above the knee that can become pulmonary embolisms. Usually performed in a physician\u2019s office or hospital outpatient diagnostic cen- ter, Doppler ultrasound usually takes 30\u201345 minutes. Impedance plethysmography records changes in blood volume and vessel resistance. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around the leg above the knee, four elec- trodes are placed near the knee and the ankle, and the cuff is inflated. How efficiently the veins return to nor- mal is measured. Performed in a physician\u2019s office, it takes about 15 minutes. Treatment Deep vein thrombosis can be treated with drug ther- apy, bed rest, and gradient elastic stockings. Medications include anticoagulants that \u201cthin\u201d blood to prevent fur- ther growth of blood clots, as well as clot-dissolving drugs. Heparin is a common injectable anticoagulant, and is usually followed by coumadin tablets for at least three months. Bed rest with the patient\u2019s legs elevated is necessary until the condition improves. Gradient elastic stockings should then be worn, and standing for long periods of time avoided. In some cases, a filter is placed in the major vein (the inferior vena cava) to trap emboli or clots before they get to the heart and lungs. Alternative treatment Deep vein thrombosis can be life-threatening and must be treated with conventional medical therapies. However, there are alternative therapies that can be used in conjunction with emergency treatments to dissolve the clot that help support the body and prevent recurrence. A trained alternative health care practitioner should be con- sulted due to the severity of this condition. Prognosis In many cases, deep vein thrombosis can be success- fully treated if diagnosed early. Prevention Deep vein thrombosis can be prevented through pro- phylactic anticoagulant drugs and venous stasis prevention with gradient elastic stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression of the legs. High-risk patients often need to remain on anticoagulants like Coumadin indefinitely. Resources BOOKS DeBakey, Michael E., and Antonio M.

          "content": "ease (COPD). In fact, about 85% of patients diagnosed with cor pulmonale have COPD. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are types of COPD. High blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) causes the enlargement of the right ventricle. In addition to COPD, cor pulmonale may also be caused by lung dis- eases, such as cystic fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumoconiosis. Loss of lung tissue after lung surgery or certain chest-wall disturbances can produce cor pul- monale, as can neuromuscular diseases, such as muscu- lar dystrophy . A large pulmonary thromboembolism (blood clot) may lead to acute cor pulmonale. Causes and symptoms Any respiratory disease or malfunction that affects the circulatory system of the lungs may lead to cor pul- monale. These circulatory changes cause the right ventri- cle to compensate for the extra work required to pump blood through the lungs. The right ventricle has thin walls and is crescent-shaped. The resulting pressure causes the right ventricle to dilate and bulge, eventually leading to its failure. Cor pulmonale should be expected in any patient with COPD and other respiratory or neuromuscular dis- eases. Initial symptoms of cor pulmonale may actually reflect those of the underlying disease. These may include chronic coughing, wheezing, weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath . Edema (abnormal buildup of fluid), weakness, and discomfort in the upper chest may be evident in cor pulmonale. Diagnosis An electrocardiograph (EKG) will show signs such as frequent premature contractions in the atria or ventri- cles. Chest x rays may show enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery. This sign, along with an enlarged main pulmonary artery, indicates pulmonary artery hypertension in patients with COPD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often the preferred method of diagnosis for cor pulmonale because it can clearly show and measure volume of the pulmonary arteries. Other tests used to support a diagnosis of cor pulmonale may include arterial blood gas analysis , pulmonary function tests, and hematocrit. Treatment Treatment of cor pulmonale is aimed at increasing a patient\u2019s exercise tolerance and improving oxygen levels of the arterial blood. Treatment is also aimed at the underlying condition that is producing cor pulmonale. Common treatments include antibiotics for respiratory KEY TERMS Ventricle\u2014A cavity, as in the brain or heart. The right ventricle of the heart drives blood from the heart into the pulmonary artery, which supplies blood to the lungs. infection; anticoagulants to reduce the risk of throm- boembolism; and digitalis, oxygen, and phlebotomy to reduce red blood cell count. A low-salt diet and restricted fluids are often prescribed. Alternative treatment Co-management of the patient with cor pulmonale should be coordinated between the medical doctor and the alternative practitioner. The first step in treatment is to determine the cause of the condition and to evaluate all organ systems of the body. Dietary considerations, for example, a low-salt diet and reduced fluid intake aimed at reducing the edema associated with cor pulmonale, can be supportive aspects of treatment. Prognosis The prognosis for cor pulmonale is poor, particularly because it occurs late in the process of serious disease. Prevention Cor pulmonale is best prevented by prevention of COPD and other irreversible diseases that lead to heart failure. Smoking cessation is critically important. Care- fully following the recommended course of treatment for the underlying disease may help prevent cor pulmonale. Resources BOOKS Professional Guide to Diseases. 5th ed.

Placek Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant (ELISA) see AIDS tests Embolism Definition An embolism is an obstruction in a blood vessel due to a blood clot or other foreign matter that gets stuck while traveling through the bloodstream. The plural of embolism is emboli. Description Emboli have moved from the place where they were formed through the bloodstream to another part of the body, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow of blood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clots but are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis- sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or single and massive. They can be life-threatening and require immediate emergency medical care. There are three gen- eral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary. Pulmonary emboli are the most common. Arterial embolism In arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc- tion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, or thigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication of heart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere- bral embolism) causes stroke, which can be fatal. An estimated 5\u201314% of all strokes are caused by cerebral emboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis- sue death and amputation of the affected limb if not treated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneys can also suffer damage from emboli. Gas embolism Gas emboli result from the compression of respira- tory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapid changes in environmental pressure, for example, while flying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases, gases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood and other tissues become small bubbles that can block blood flow and cause organ damage. Pulmonary embolism In a pulmonary embolism, a common illness, blood flow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli block the main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there are no initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quickly become fatal. According to the American Heart Associa- tion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonary emboli annually and 60,000 die from it. A pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less than 10% of patients who die from a pulmonary embolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than 90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications of deep vein thrombosis , blood clots in the deep vein of the leg or pelvis. Causes and symptoms Arterial emboli are usually a complication of heart disease where blood clots form in the heart\u2019s chambers. Gas emboli are caused by rapid changes in environmen- tal pressure that could happen when flying or scuba div- ing. A pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel through the blood stream to the lungs and block a pulmonary artery. More than 90% of the cases of pul- monary embolism are a complication of deep vein thrombosis, which typically occurs in patients who have had orthopedic surgery and patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure. Risk factors for arterial and pulmonary emboli include: prolonged bed rest, surgery, childbirth , heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer,obesity,a broken hip or leg, oral contraceptives , sickle cell ane- mia, chest trauma, certain congenital heart defects, and old age. Risk factors for gas emboli include: scuba div- ing, amateur plane flight, exercise, injury, obesity, dehy- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1169 Embolism",

The use of zinc lozenges may be moving toward acceptance by practitioners of traditional medicine. In 1996 the Cleveland Clinic tested zinc gluconate lozenges and found using zinc in the first 24 hours after cold symptoms occurred shortened the duration of symptoms. KEY TERMS Bronchial tubes \u2014The major airways to the lungs and their main branches. Coronavirus\u2014a genus of viruses that cause respi- ratory disease and gastroenteritis. Corticosteroids \u2014A group of hormones produced naturally by the adrenal gland or manufactured synthetically. They are often used to treat inflam- mation. Examples include cortisone and pred- nisone. Eustachian tube\u2014A thin tube between the middle ear and the pharnyx. Its purpose is to equalize pressure on either side of the ear drum. Rhinovirus\u2014A virus that infects the upper respira- tory system and causes the common cold. The mechanism by which zinc worked was not clear, but additional studies are underway. Prognosis Given time, the body will make antibodies to cure itself of a cold. Most colds last a week to 10 days. Most people start feeling better within four or five days. Occa- sionally a cold will lead to a secondary bacterial infection that causes strep throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, sinus infection, or a middle ear infection. These conditions usu- ally clear up rapidly when treated with an antibiotic. Prevention It is not possible to prevent colds because the viruses that cause colds are common and highly infectious. How- ever, there are some steps individuals can take to reduce their spread. These include: \u2022 washing hands well and frequently, especially after touching the nose or before handling food \u2022 covering the mouth and nose when sneezing \u2022 disposing of used tissues properly \u2022 avoiding close contact with someone who has a cold during the first two to four days of their infection \u2022 not sharing food, eating utensils, or cups with anyone \u2022 avoiding crowded places where cold germs can spread \u2022 eating a healthy diet and getting adequate sleep Resources BOOKS Burton Goldberg Group. \u201cColds and Flu.\u201d In Alternative Medi- cine: The Definitive Guide, ed.

          "content": "oils of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ), eucalyptus blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus ), peppermint, (Mentha x piperata), or scots pine oil (Pinus sylvestris) to stimulate the nervous system and reduce fatigue. These oils can be added to bathwater or massage oil as a topical applica- tion. Citrus oils such as lemon, orange, grapefruit, and lime have a similar effect, and can be added to a steam bath or vaporizer for inhalation. Herbal remedies Herbal remedies that act as circulatory stimulants can offset the symptoms of fatigue in some individuals. An herbalist may recommend an infusion of ginger (Zin- giber officinale ) root or treatment with cayenne ( Cap- sicum annuum ), balmony ( Chelone glabra ), damiana (Turnera diffusa), ginseng (Panax ginseng), or rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) to treat ongoing fatigue. An infusion is prepared by mixing the herb with boiling water, steeping it for several minutes, and then removing the herb from the infusion before drinking. A strainer, tea ball, or infuser can be used to immerse loose herb in the boiling water before steeping and separating it. A second method of infusion is to mix the loose herbal preparation with cold water first, bringing the mixture to a boil in a pan or teapot, and then separating the tea from the infusion with a strainer before drinking. Caffeine-containing central nervous system stimu- lants such as tea (Camellia senensis) and cola (Cola niti- da) can provide temporary, short-term relief of fatigue symptoms. However, long-term use of caffeine can cause restlessness, irritability, and other unwanted side effects, and in some cases may actually work to increase fatigue after the stimulating effects of the caffeine wear off. To avoid these problems, caffeine intake should be limited to 300 mg or less a day (the equivalent of 4-8 cups of brewed, hot tea). Traditional Chinese medicine Chinese medicine regards fatigue as a blockage or misalignment of qi, or energy flow, inside the human body. The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupuncture and/or herbal therapy to rebalance the entire system. The Chinese formula Minot Bupleurum soup (or Xiao Chia Hu Tang) has been used for nearly 2,000 years for the type of chronic fatigue that comes after the flu. In this condition, the person has low-grade fever, nausea, and fatigue. There are other formulas that are helpful in other cases. Acupuncture involves the placement of a series of thin needles into the skin at tar- geted locations on the body known as acupoints in order to harmonize the energy flow within the human body. KEY TERMS Aromatherapy \u2014The therapeutic use of plant- derived, aromatic essential oils to promote physi- cal and psychological well-being. Guided imagery\u2014The use of relaxation and men- tal visualization to improve mood and/or physical well-being. Hydrotherapy\u2014Hydrotherapy, or water therapy, is use of water (hot, cold, steam, or ice) to relieve discomfort and promote physical well-being. Deep breathing exercises Individuals under stress often experience fast, shal- low breathing. This type of breathing, known as chest breathing, can lead to shortness of breath , increased muscle tension, inadequate oxygenation of blood, and fatigue. Breathing exercises can both improve respiratory function and relieve stress and fatigue. Deep breathing exercises are best performed while laying flat on the back on a hard surface, usually the floor. The knees are bent, and the body (particularly the mouth, nose, and face) is relaxed. One hand should be placed on the chest and one on the abdomen to monitor breathing technique. With proper breathing techniques, the abdomen will rise further than the chest. The individual takes a series of long, deep breaths through the nose, attempting to raise the abdomen instead of the chest. Air is exhaled through the relaxed mouth. Deep breathing can be continued for up to 20 minutes. After the exerciseis complete, the individual checks again for body tension and relaxation. Once deep breathing techniques have been mastered, an individual can use deep breathing at any time or place as a quick method of relieving tension and preventing fatigue. Color therapy Color therapy, also known as chromatherapy, is based on the premise that certain colors are infused with healing energies. The therapy uses the seven colors of the rainbow to promote balance and healing in the mind and body. Red promotes energy, empowerment, and stimula- tion. Physically, it is thought to improve circulation and stimulate red blood cell production. Red is associated with the seventh chakra, located at the root; or base of spine. In yoga, the chakras are specific spiritual energy centers of the body. Therapeutic color can be administered in a number of ways.

Patients should take 1,000 mg of lysine three times a day during a cold sore outbreak and 500 mg daily on an ongoing basis to prevent recurrences. Intake of the amino acid arginine should be reduced. Foods rich in arginine that should be avoided are chocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds. Vitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits that helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) have been shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreak and reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B complex includes important vitamins that support the nervous sys- tem where viruses can hide out. B complex vitamins can also help manage stress, an important contributing factor to the outbreak of herpes viruses. Applying the oil in vita- min E capsules directly to cold sores may provide relief. Zinc lozenges appear to affect the reproduction of viruses and also enhance the immune system. Ointments contain- ing lemon balm ( Melissa officinalis ) or licorice ( Gly- cyrrhiza glabra) and peppermint (Mentha piperita) have been shown to help cold sores heal. Prognosis Oral herpes can be painful and embarrassing, but it is not a serious infection. There is no cure for oral herpes, but outbreaks usually occur less frequently after age 35. The spread of the herpes virus to the eyes is very serious. The herpes virus can infect the cells in the cornea and cause scarring that may impair vision. Prevention The only way to prevent oral herpes is to avoid con- tact with infected persons. This is not an easy solution because many people aren\u2019t aware that they are infected and can easily infect others. Currently there are no her- pes vaccines available, although herpes vaccines are being tested. KEY TERMS Latent\u2014A nonactive virus which is in a dormant state within a cell. The herpes virus is latent in the nervous system. Prodrome\u2014The Symptoms that warn of the begin- ning of disease. The herpes prodrome consists of pain, burning, tingling, or itching at a site before blisters are visible. Recurrence\u2014The return of an active infection fol- lowing a period of latency. Several practices can reduce the occurrence of cold sores and the spread of virus to other body locations or people. These practices are: \u2022 Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting prolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to the face and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with a large brim is also helpful. \u2022 Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or pinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to other parts of the lips or face and infect those sites. \u2022 Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should wash their hands carefully before touching others. An infected person can spread the virus to others even when he or she has no obvious blisters. \u2022 Avoid contact with others during active infection. Infected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contact with others until after the cold sores have healed. \u2022 Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child\u2019s sore. \u2022 Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes or lips of a baby who is under six months old. \u2022 Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected children to share toys that may be put into the mouth. Toys that have been mouthed should be disinfected before other children play with them. \u2022 Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty of sleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of get- ting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on cold sores. Also, good general health keeps the immune sys- tem strong; this helps to keep the virus in check and prevents outbreaks. Resources BOOKS Gorbach, Sherman, John Bartlett, and Neil Blacklow, eds.

Garlic ( Allium sativum ) and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), both antiseptic agents against staph infections, may be taken. The daily dosage would vary from person to person and is based on the severity of the infection. Echinacea (Echinacea spp.) is helpful in modu- lating immune function. Again, the dosage would vary. Daily doses of 30\u201350 mg zinc and 1,000\u20135,000 mg Vitamin C (taken in equal amounts at several times dur- ing the day), and 300\u20132,000 mg bioflavinoids can also strengthen the body\u2019s infection-fighting ability. High doses of vitamins and minerals should not be used with- out a doctor\u2019s approval. Prognosis If properly treated, the symptoms of bacterial folli- culitis generally disappear in about two weeks. Fungal folliculitis should clear up within six weeks. But it can worsen if the condition is misdiagnosed and inappropri- ately treated with steroid creams. Prevention Anyone who has a tendency to develop folliculitis should cleanse the skin with antibacterial soap twice a day and before shaving and should not use oily skin lotions. Men should not shave while the beard area is infected. When they begin shaving again, they should use a new blade each time. Women who have had fungal fol- liculitis should use depilatory creams instead of razors. Daily shampooing can help prevent folliculitis in the scalp.

Cough suppressants such as codeine, for example, work against guaifenesin because they discourage coughing up the secretions that the expectorant loosens. There are other ways to loosen and clear the respirato- ry secretions associated with colds. These include using a humidifier and drinking six to eight glasses of water a day. Description Guaifenesin is an ingredient in many cough medi- cines, such as Anti-Tuss, Dristan Cold & Cough, Guaifed, GuaiCough, and some Robitussin products. Some products that contain guaifenesin are available only with a physician\u2019s prescription; others can be bought without a prescription. They come in several forms, including capsules, tablets, and liquids. Recommended dosage Adults and children 12 and over 200\u2013400 mg every four hours. No more than 2,400 mg in 24 hours. Children 6\u201311 100\u2013200 mg every four hours. No more than 1,200 mg in 24 hours. KEY TERMS Asthma\u2014A disease in which the air passages of the lungs become inflamed and narrowed. Bronchitis \u2014Inflammation of the air passages of the lungs. Chronic\u2014A word used to describe a long-lasting condition. Chronic conditions often develop grad- ually and involve slow changes. Cough suppressant \u2014Medicine that stops or pre- vents coughing. Emphysema \u2014An irreversible lung disease in which breathing becomes increasingly difficult. Mucus\u2014Thick fluid produced by the moist mem- branes that line many body cavities and structures. Phlegm\u2014Thick mucus produced in the air passages.

Children 2\u20135 50\u2013100 mg every four hours. No more than 600 mg in 24 hours. Children under two Not recommended. Precautions Do not take more than the recommended daily dosage of guaifenesin. Guaifenesin is not meant to be used for coughs asso- ciated with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis,o r smoking. It also should not be used for coughs that are producing a large amount of mucus. A lingering cough could be a sign of a serious med- ical condition. Coughs that last more than seven days or are associated with fever, rash, sore throat , or lasting headache should have medical attention. Call a physi- cian as soon as possible. Some studies suggest that guaifenesin causes birth defects . Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should check with their physicians before using any products that contain guaifenesin. Whether guaifen- esin passes into breast milk is not known, but no ill effects have been reported in nursing babies whose moth- ers used guaifenesin. Side effects Side effects are rare, but may include vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, headache, skin rash, and hives. Interactions Guaifenesin is not known to interact with any foods or other drugs. However, cough medicines that contain guaifenesin may contain other ingredients that do inter- act with foods or drugs. Check with a physician or phar- macist for details about specific products.

          "content": "Description Canker sores occur on the inside of the mouth, usu- ally on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and/or soft palate. They can also occur on the tongue and in the throat. Often, several canker sores will appear at the same time and may be grouped in clusters. Canker sores appear as a whitish, round area with a red border. The sores are painful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore is about one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa- sionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious. Approximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect- ed with recurring canker sores, and more women than men get them. Women are more likely to have canker sores during their premenstrual period. Canker sores are sometimes confused with cold sores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus. This disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters, can occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her- pes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and the gums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth. Cold sores are infectious. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev- er, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac- tion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma to the affected areas from toothbrush scrapes, stress, hor- mones, and food allergies . Canker sores tend to appear in response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling or mildly painful itching sensation in the area where the sore will appear. After one to several days, a small red swelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitish color with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a red ring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The main symptom is pain. Canker sores can be very painful, espe- cially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue. They last for one to two weeks. KEY TERMS Inflammation\u2014A local reaction to tissue injury or damage, usually characterized by pain, swelling, and redness. Sore\u2014A wound, lesion, or ulcer on the skin. Ulcer\u2014A site of damage to the skin or mucous membrane that is characterized by the formation of pus, death of tissue, and is frequently accompa- nied by an inflammatory reaction. Diagnosis Canker sores are diagnosed by observation of the blister. A distinction between canker sores and cold sores must be made because cold sores are infectious and the herpes infection can be transmitted to other people. The two sores can usually be distinguished visually and there are specific diagnostic tests for herpes infection. Treatment Since canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is not usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topi- cal anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of the sores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimes speeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods can help reduce the pain associated with canker sores. Alternative treatment Alternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at healing existing sores and preventing their recurrence. Several herbal remedies, including calendula (Calendula officinalis ), myrrh ( Commiphora molmol ), and gold- enseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), may be helpful in the treatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teas made from these herbs are applied directly to the sores. The tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the sores when the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking dan- delion ( Taraxacum officinale ) tea or capsules may help heal sores and also prevent future outbreaks. Since canker sores are often brought on by stress, such stress- relieving techniques as meditation , guided imagery , and certain acupressure exercises may help prevent canker sores or lessen their severity. Prognosis There is no cure for canker sores. They do not get larger or occur more frequently with age. Resources BOOKS Larsen, D. E., ed.

          "content": "cells lining the nasal passages. Histamine increases blood flow and causes the cells to swell. Antihistamines are taken to relieve the symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and congestion. Side effects are dry mouth and drowsiness, especially with the first few doses. Antihistamines should not be taken by people who are driving or operating dangerous equipment. Some people have allergic reactions to antihistamines. Com- mon over-the-counter antihistamines include Chlor- Trimeton, Dimetapp, Tavist, and Actifed. The generic name for two common antihistamines are chlorpheni- ramine and diphenhydramine. Decongestants work to constrict the blood flow to the vessels in the nose. This can shrink the tissue, reduce congestion, and open inflamed nasal passages, making breathing easier. Decongestants can make people feel jit- tery or keep them from sleeping. They should not be used by people with heart disease, high blood pressure, or glaucoma . Some common decongestants are Neo- Synepherine, Novafed, and Sudafed. The generic names of common decongestants include phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, and in nasal sprays naphazoline, oxymetazoline and xylometazoline. Many over the counter medications are combina- tions of both antihistamines and decongestants; an ache and pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, Medipren); and a cough suppressant (dextromethor- phan). Common combination medications include Tylenol Cold and Flu, Triaminic, Sudafed Plus, and Tavist D. Aspirin should not be given to children with a cold because of its association with a risk of Reye\u2019s syn- drome, a serious disease. Nasal sprays and nose drops are other products pro- moted for reducing nasal congestion. These usually con- tain a decongestant, but the decongestant can act more quickly and strongly than ones found in pills or liquids because it is applied directly in the nose. Congestion returns after a few hours. People can become dependent on nasal sprays and nose drops. If used for a long time, users may suffer withdrawal symptoms when these products are discon- tinued. Nasal sprays and nose drops should not be used for more than a few days. Check the label for recommen- dations on length and frequency of use. People react differently to different cold medications and may find some more helpful than others. A medica- tion may be effective initially, then lose some of its effec- tiveness. Children sometimes react differently than adults. Over-the-counter cold remedies should not be given to infants without consulting a doctor first. Care should be taken not to exceed the recommend- ed dosages, especially when combination medications or nasal sprays are taken. Individuals should determine whether they wish to use any of these drugs. None of them shorten or cure a cold. At best they help a person feel more comfortable. People who are confused about the drugs in any over-the-counter cold remedies should ask their pharmacist for an explanation. In addition to the optional use of over the counter cold remedies, there are some self-care steps that people can take to ease their discomfort. These include: \u2022 drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding acidic juices, which may irritate the throat \u2022 gargling with warm salt water\u2014made by adding one teaspoon of salt to 8 oz of water\u2014for a sore throat \u2022 not smoking \u2022 getting plenty of rest \u2022 using a cool-mist room humidifier to ease congestion and sore throat \u2022 rubbing Vaseline or other lubricant under the nose to prevent irritation from frequent nose blowing \u2022 for babies too young to blow their noses, the mucus should be suctioned gently with an infant nasal aspira- tor, it may be necessary to soften the mucus first with a few drops of salt water Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners emphasize that people get colds because their immune systems are weak. They point out that everyone is exposed to cold viruses, but not everyone gets every cold. The difference seems to be in the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Pre- vention focuses on strengthening the immune system by eating a healthy diet low in sugars and high in fresh fruits and vegetables, practicing meditation to reduce stress, and getting regular moderate exercise.

          "content": "Alternative treatment Initially, alternative practitioners will suggest that the patient drink an adequate amount of water each day (six to eight glasses), exercise on a regular basis, and eat a diet high in soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers include pectin, flax, and gums; insoluble fibers include psyllium and brans from grains like wheat and oats. Fresh fruits and vegetables contain both soluble and insoluble fibers. Castor oil, applied topically to the abdomen and covered by a heat source (a heating pad or hot water bottle), can help relieve constipation when used nightly for 20\u201330 minutes. Acupressure This needleless form of acupuncture is said to relax the abdomen, ease discomfort, and stimulate regular bowel movements when diet and exercise fail to do so. After lying down, the patient closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. For two minutes, he applies gentle fingertip pressure to a point about two and one-half inches below the navel. Accupressure can also be applied to the outer edges of one elbow crease and maintained for 30 seconds before pressing the crease of the other elbow. This should be done three times a day to relieve constipation. Aromatherapy Six drops of rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) and six drops of thyme ( Thymus spp.) diluted by 1 oz of almond oil, olive oil, or another carrier oil can relieve constipation when used to massage the abdomen. Herbal therapy A variety of herbal therapies can be useful in the treatment of constipation. Several herbs, including chamomile (Matricaria recutita), dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum ), and burdock ( Arctium lappa ), act as bit- ters, stimulating the movement of the digestive and excretory systems. There are also \u201claxative\u201d herbs that assist with bowel movement. Two of these are senna (Cassia senna ) and buckthorn ( Rhamnus purshiana ). These \u201claxative\u201d herbs are stronger acting on elimination than bitters and can sometimes cause cramping (mixing them with a calming herb like fennel or caraway can help reduce cramping). Both senna and buckthorn are power- ful herbs that are best used with direction from an experi- enced practitioner, since they can have adverse side effects and the patient may become dependent on them. Homeopathy Homeopathy also can offer assistance with consti- pation. There are acute remedies for constipation that can be found in one of the many home remedy books on homeopathic medicine. A constitutional prescription also can help rebalance someone who is struggling with con- stipation. Massage Massaging the leg from knee to hip in the morning, at night, and before trying to move the bowels is said to relieve constipation. There is also a specific Swedish massage technique that can help relieve constipation. Yoga The knee-chest position, said to relieve gas and stim- ulate abdominal organs, involves: \u2022 standing straight with arms at the sides \u2022 lifting the right knee toward the chest \u2022 grasping the right ankle with the left hand \u2022 pulling the leg as close to the chest as possible \u2022 holding the position for about eight seconds \u2022 repeating these steps with the left leg The cobra position, which can be repeated as many as four time a day, involves: \u2022 lying on the stomach with legs together \u2022 placing the palms just below the shoulders, holding elbows close to the body \u2022 inhaling, then lifting the head (face forward) and chest off the floor GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 907 Constipation Transverse colon Descending colon Stool Sigmoid colon Rectum Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in which bowel movements occur less often than usual or consist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to pass.

When treat- ed with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure, many patients in the study had marked improvements in their CFS symptoms. Diagnosis CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim- inating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques- tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses they have had, and medications they are taking. They also conduct a physical examination , neurological examination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly- ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the United States, many doctors use the CDC case definition to determine if a patient has CFS. To be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both of the following criteria: \u2022 Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for at least six months that is of new or definite onset, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly relieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational, social, or personal activities to be greatly reduced. \u2022 Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short- term memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following exercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more than 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must not have started before the fatigue began. Treatment There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual- ly are individualized to each person\u2019s particular symp- toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom- mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced diet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and resting when needed are key to maintaining existing energy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to keep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too much exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp- toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also may help some people with CFS. Many medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal preparations have been used to treat CFS. While many of these are unproven, others seem to provide some people with relief. People with CFS should discuss their treatment KEY TERMS Arthralgia\u2014Joint pain.

However, a c-section is safer than a vaginal delivery when the baby is 8 lb (3.6 kg) or larger, in a breech posi- tion with the feet crossed, or in a breech position with the head hyperextended. A woman should receive regular prenatal care and be able to alert her doctor to the first signs of trouble. Once labor begins, she should be encouraged to move around and to urinate. The doctor should be conservative in diagnosing dystocia (nonprogressive labor) and fetal distress, taking a position of \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d before deciding to operate. Description The most common reason that a cesarean section is performed (in 35% of all cases, according to the United States Public Health Service) is that the woman has had a previous c-section. The \u201conce a cesarean, always a cesare- an\u201d rule originated when the classical uterine incision was made vertically; the resulting scar was weak and had a risk of rupturing in subsequent deliveries. Today, the incision is almost always made horizontally across the lower end of the uterus (this is called a \u201clow transverse incision\u201d), resulting in reduced blood loss and a decreased chance of rupture. This kind of incision allows many women to have a vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC). The second most common reason that a c-section is performed (in 30% of all cases) is difficult childbirth due to nonprogressive labor (dystocia). Uterine contrac- KEY TERMS Breech presentation \u2014The condition in which the baby enters the birth canal with its buttocks or feet first. Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) \u2014The condi- tion in which the baby\u2019s head is too large to fit through the mother\u2019s pelvis. Classical incision\u2014In a cesarean section, an incision made vertically along the uterus; this kind of incision makes a larger opening but also creates more bleed- ing, a greater chance of infection, and a weaker scar. Dystocia \u2014Failure to progress in labor, either because the cervix will not dilate (expand) further or (after full dilation) the head does not descend through the mother\u2019s pelvis. Low transverse incision\u2014Incision made horizontal- ly across the lower end of the uterus; this kind of incision is preferred for less bleeding and stronger healing. Placenta previa \u2014The placenta totally or partially covers the cervix, preventing vaginal delivery. Placental abruption \u2014Separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut- ting off blood flow to the baby. Prolapsed cord\u2014The umbilical cord is pushed into the vagina ahead of the baby and becomes com- pressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) \u2014Difficulty breathing, found in infants with immature lungs. Transverse presentation \u2014The baby is laying side- ways across the cervix instead of head first. VBAC\u2014Vaginal birth after cesarean. tions may be weak or irregular, the cervix may not be dilating, or the mother\u2019s pelvic structure may not allow adequate passage for birth. When the baby\u2019s head is too large to fit through the pelvis, the condition is called cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD). Another 12% of c-sections are performed to deliver a baby in a breech presentation: buttocks or feet first. Breech presentation is found in about 3% of all births. In 9% of all cases, c-sections are performed in response to fetal distress. Fetal distress refers to any situ- ation that threatens the baby, such as the umbilical cord getting wrapped around the baby\u2019s neck. This may appear on the fetal heart monitor as an abnormal heart rate or rhythm. The remaining 14% of c-sections are indicated by other serious factors. One is prolapse of the umbilical cord: the cord is pushed into the vagina ahead of the baby and becomes compressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby. Another is placental abruption: the placenta sepa- rates from the uterine wall before the baby is born, cut- ting off blood flow to the baby. The risk of this is espe- cially high in multiple births (twins, triplets, or more). A third factor is placenta previa : the placenta covers the cervix partially or completely, making vaginal delivery impossible. In some cases requiring c-section, the baby is in a transverse position, lying horizontally across the pelvis, perhaps with a shoulder in the birth canal. The mother\u2019s health may make delivery by c-section the safer choice, especially in cases of maternal diabetes, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 725 Cesarean section",

Once the episiotomy is made, the baby is born with a few pushes. Third stage In the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out of the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. The placenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam- eter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and has served to convey nourishment from the mother to the fetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con- tractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point. It is important that all of the placenta be removed from the uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normal after delivery may be much heavier. Breech presentation Approximately 4% of babies are in what is called the \u201cbreech\u201d position when labor begins. In breech pre- sentation, the baby\u2019s head is not the part pressing against the cervix. Instead the baby\u2019s bottom or legs are posi- tioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. An obstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head down position using a technique called version. This is only successful approximately half the time. The risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation are much higher than with a head-first presentation and the mother and attending practitioner will need to weigh the risks and make a decision on whether to deliver via a cesarean section or attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of the risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre- sentation\u2014of which there are three. Frank breech (the baby\u2019s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com- mon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types are complete breech (in which the baby\u2019s legs are crossed under and in front of the body) and footling breech (in which one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birth canal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery. Even in complete breech, other factors should be met before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasound examination should be done to be sure the baby does not have an unusually large head and that the head is tilted forward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetal monitoring and close observation of the progress of labor are also important. A slowing of labor or any indication of difficulty in the body passing through the pelvis should be an indication that it is safer to consider a cesarean section. Forceps delivery If the labor is not progressing as it should or if the baby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for a forceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device that resembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around the baby\u2019s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out of the vagina. Forceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated, and they might be required if: \u2022 the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the baby into the birth canal \u2022 the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal unaided \u2022 the baby shows signs of stress \u2022 the mother is too exhausted to push Before placing the forceps around the baby\u2019s head, pain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth- er. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother\u2019s bladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapy water. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth, although tears can still occur. The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time into the vagina and around the side of the baby\u2019s head to gently grasp the head. When both \u201ctongs\u201d are in place, the doctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through the birth canal as the uterus contracts. Sometimes the baby can be delivered this way after the very next contraction. The frequency of forceps delivery varies from one hospital to the next, depending on the experience of staff and the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital. Some obstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as a way to avoid cesarean birth. However, other obstetrical services don\u2019t use forceps at all. Complications from forceps deliveries can occur. Sometimes they may cause nerve damage or temporary GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 758 Childbirth Stage 2: Expulsion of the fetus Stage 2: Expulsion of the fetus.(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)",

Fetal monitoring Fetal monitoring is a process in which the baby\u2019s heart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during labor and birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring. A special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be used. This is a simple and non-invasive method. The Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a handheld listening device that transmits the sounds of the heart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece. It can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks after conception. This method offers intermittent monitoring. It allows the mother freedom to move about and is also useful during contractions. Electronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and provides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to the mother\u2019s contractions. It can be used either continuously or intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan- cies, and is not often recommended for low risk ones KEY TERMS Amniotic sac \u2014The membranous sac that sur- rounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid as pregnancy advances. Breech birth\u2014Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead of the usual head first delivery.

Placenta \u2014The organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and that links the blood supplies of mother and baby. because it renders the mother immobile and requires interpretation. Internal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more accurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu- ous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires the mother\u2019s water to be broken and that she be two to three centimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only. Telemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor- ing. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrument on the mother\u2019s thigh. The mother is able to remain mobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used in high-risk situations. Treatment Most women choose some type of pain relief during childbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to drugs. The specific choice may depend on what\u2019s available, the woman\u2019s preferences, her doctor\u2019s recommendations, and how the labor is proceeding. All drugs have some risks and some advantages. Regional anesthetics Regional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals. In this technique, medication is injected into the space around the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med- ications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig- nals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensation from the waist down. An epidural or spinal block can provide complete pain relief during cesarean birth. An epidural is placed with the woman lying on her side or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allow more space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbed with antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in the skin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between two vertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of the spinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con- tinuous doses of anesthetic to be given. This type of anesthesia provides complete pain relief, and can help conserve a woman\u2019s energy, since she can relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes- thesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may be harder for a woman to bear down when it comes time to push, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjusted as this stage nears. Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as epidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c- section delivery. It is administered in the same way as an epidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amount of anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected at one time. Because of the anesthetic\u2019s effect on motor nerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 760 Childbirth",

          "content": "Purpose Cesarean sections, also called c-sections, are per- formed whenever abnormal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery, threatening the life or health of the mother or the baby. The procedure is performed in the United States on nearly one of every four babies deliv- ered\u2014more than 900,000 babies each year. The proce- dure is often used in cases where the mother has had a previous c-section. Dystocia, or difficult labor, is the other common cause of c-sections. Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the three following conditions: abnormalities in the mother\u2019s birth canal; abnormalities in the position of the fetus; or abnormalities in the labor, including weak or infrequent contractions. Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal brain damage can result from oxygen deprivation. Fetal dis- tress is often related to abnormalities in the position of the fetus or abnormalities in the birth canal, causing reduced blood flow through the placenta. Other condi- tions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginal herpes, hypertension, and diabetes in the mother. Precautions There are several ways that obstetricians and other doctors diagnose conditions that may make a c-section necessary. Ultrasound testing reveals the positions of the baby and the placenta and may be used to estimate the baby\u2019s size and gestational age. Fetal heart monitors, in use since the 1970s, transmit any signals of fetal distress. Oxygen deprivation may be determined by checking the amniotic fluid for meconium (feces)\u2014a lack of oxygen causes an unborn baby to defecate. Oxygen deprivation may also be determined by testing the pH of a blood sample taken from the baby\u2019s scalp; a pH of 7.25 or high- er is normal, between 7.2 and 7.25 is suspicious, and below 7.2 is a sign of trouble. When a c-section is being considered because labor is not progressing, the mother should first be encouraged to walk around to stimulate labor. Labor may also be stimulated with the drug oxytocin. When a c-section is being considered because the baby is in a breech position, the doctor may first attempt to reposition the baby; this is called external cephalic version. The doctor may also try a vaginal breech deliv- ery, depending on the size of the mother\u2019s pelvis, the size GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 724 Cesarean section This baby is being delivered by cesarean section.(Photograph by John Smith, Custom Medical Stock Photo.)",

          "content": "out common physical causes of exhaustion, such as blood tests to check for iron-deficiency anemia. Diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome is signifi- cantly more difficult. Because there is no specific biolog- ical marker or conclusive blood test to check for the dis- order, healthcare providers must rely on the patient\u2019s pre- sentation and severity of symptoms to make a diagnosis. In many cases, individuals with chronic fatigue syn- drome go through a battery of invasive diagnostic tests and several years of consultation with medical profes- sionals before receiving a correct diagnosis. Treatment Conventional medicine recommends the dietary and lifestyle changes outlined above as a first line of defense against fatigue. Individuals who experience occasional fatigue symptoms may benefit from short term use of caffeine-containing central nervous stimulants, which make people more alert, less drowsy, and improve coor- dination. However, these should be prescribed with extreme caution, as overuse of the drug can lead to seri- ous sleep disorders, like insomnia. Another reason to avoid extended use of caffeine is its associated withdrawal symptoms. People who use large amounts of caffeine over long periods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens, they have to use more and more caffeine to get the same effects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence. If an individual stops using caffeine abruptly, withdrawal symptoms may occur, including headache , fatigue, drowsiness, yawn- ing, irritability, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symptoms can go on for as long as a week. Alternative treatment The treatment of fatigue depends on its direct cause, but there are several commonly prescribed treatments for non-specific fatigue, including dietary and lifestyle changes, the use of essential oils and herbal therapies, deep breathing exercises, traditional Chinese medicine, and color therapy. Dietary changes Inadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake can cause fatigue symptoms. To maintain an adequate energy supply and promote overall physical well-being, individ- uals should eat a balanced diet and observe the following nutritional guidelines: \u2022 Drink plenty of water. Individuals should try to drink 9 to 12 glasses of water a day. Dehydration can reduce blood volume, which leads to feelings of fatigue. \u2022 Eat iron-rich foods (i.e., liver, raisins, spinach, apri- cots). Iron enables the blood to transport oxygen throughout the tissues, organs, and muscles, and dimin- ished oxygenation of the blood can result in fatigue. \u2022 Avoid high-fat meals and snacks. High fat foods take longer to digest, reducing blood flow to the brain, heart, and rest of the body while blood flow is increased to the stomach. \u2022 Eat unrefined carbohydrates and proteins together for sustained energy. \u2022 Balance proteins. Limiting protein to 15\u201320 grams per meal and two snacks of 15 grams is recommended, but not getting enough protein adds to fatigue. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should get more protein. \u2022 Get the recommended daily allowance of B complex vitamins (specifically, pantothenic acid, folic acid, thi- amine, and vitamin B 12). Deficiencies in these vitamins can trigger fatigue. \u2022 Get the recommended daily allowance of selenium, riboflavin, and niacin. These are all essential nutritional elements in metabolizing food energy. \u2022 Control portions. Individuals should only eat when they\u2019re hungry, and stop when they\u2019re full. An over- stuffed stomach can cause short-term fatigue, and indi- viduals who are overweight are much more likely to regularly experience fatigue symptoms. Lifestyle changes Lifestyle factors such as a high-stress job, erratic work hours, lack of social or family support, or erratic sleep pat- terns can all cause prolonged fatigue. If stress is an issue, a number of relaxation therapies and techniques are available to help alleviate tension, including massage, yoga, aro- matherapy, hydrotherapy, progressive relaxation exercis- es, meditation, and guided imagery. Some individuals may also benefit from individual or family counseling or psychotherapy sessions to work through stress-related fatigue that is a result of family or social issues. Maintaining healthy sleep patterns is critical to prop- er rest. Having a set \u201cbedtime\u201d helps to keep sleep on schedule. A calm and restful sleeping environment is also important to healthy sleep. Above all, the bedroom should be quiet and comfortable, away from loud noises and with adequate window treatments to keep sunlight and street- lights out. Removing distractions from the bedroom such as televisions and telephones can also be helpful.

Description Eye cancer can occur in many parts of the eye where a tumor can occur. Because of this there are sever- al types of ocular cancer. Their occurrence varies in the age of the affected individual. This article will focus on retinoblastoma , the most common eye cancer in chil- dren, and intraocular melanoma, the most common eye cancer in adults. Retinoblastoma can occur at any age but is most often seen in children younger than five. About 200 chil- dren a year are diagnosed with it in the United States. Retinoblastoma starts with a small tumor in the retina, the very back of the eye. In growing children, the retina originates from cells called retinoblasts that grow and divide very quickly. These cells eventually become the mature cells of the retina when they stop growing. In the case of retinoblastoma the retinoblasts don\u2019t stop grow- ing and form a tumor that can continue to grow and cause further complications if not treated quickly. Retinoblastoma typically has three classifications: intraocular, extraocular and recurrent retinoblastoma. In the intraocular form the cancer can be found in one or both eyes but not in tissue external of the eye. In the extraocular form the cancer has spread outside the eye. It can spread to the tissue surrounding the eye or it can invade other areas of the body. In the recurrent form the cancer returns after already being treated. It may recur in the eye, its surrounding tissues, or elsewhere in the body. Intraocular melanoma is a rare cancer overall, yet it is the most common eye cancer seen in adults. It is when cancer cells are found in the uvea of the eye. The uvea includes the iris (the colored portion of eye), the ciliary body (an eye muscle that focuses the lens) and the choroid (found in the back of the eye next to the retina). Intraocular cancer of the iris usually grows slowly and usually doesn\u2019t spread. The tumor is seen on the iris as a darker spot than the surrounding area. Intraocular cancer of the choroid or ciliary body occurs in the back of the eye. They are classified by size with a small tumor being 2-3 mm or smaller and a medium or large tumor being bigger than 3 mm. Intraocular cancer can spread and become extraocu- lar as well. If not found and treated early enough it can spread to the surrounding tissues, the optic nerve or into the eye socket. Causes and symptoms Genetics is thought to play a role in eye cancer. In regards to retinoblastoma, it is believed that if a tumor develops only in one eye then it isn\u2019t hereditary. Howev- er, if a tumor occurs in both eyes then it is hereditary. Those who have hereditary retinoblastoma have a rare risk of developing a tumor in the brain and should be monitored on a regular basis. The cause of intraocular melanoma is still vague. Genetics could play a role, but age is also a factor. Inter- estingly enough, this type of cancer is seen most often in white people from a northern European descent. The symptoms of this type of cancer usually begin with blurred vision and tenderness of the eye. Advanced symptoms may include loss of vision. If these symptoms persist a person should make an appointment with their ophthalmologist. Diagnosis An ophthalmologist makes a diagnosis. The doctor is usually able to see the tumor through the pupil or directly on the iris if the cancer is intraocular melanoma of the iris. Because the doctor can usually readily see the tumor a biopsy is rarely needed. An ultrasound or a fluorescein angiography are two tests doctors use to further diagnose eye cancers. In an ultrasound sound waves are pointed at the tumor and depending on how they reflect off the tumor the doctor can better diagnose it. In a fluorescein angiography a flu- orescent dye is injected into the patients arm. When this dye circulates through the body and reaches the eye a series of rapid pictures are taken through the pupil. The tumor will show up in these photos. Once a diagnosis has been made, the treatment can begin. Treatment The treatment depends on how far advanced the tumor is. If the tumor is in the advanced stages and there is little hope of regaining vision the most effective treat- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1260 Eye cancer",

          "content": "Having too many sex partners and becoming sexually active early has been shown to increase one\u2019s chances of contracting this disease. In addition, it has also been shown that women who don\u2019t have children or have chil- dren late in life have an increased risk for both ovarian and breast cancer. Infectious agents In the last 20 years, scientists have obtained evidence to show that approximately 15% of the world\u2019s cancer deaths can be traced to viruses, bacteria, or parasites. The most common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancers associated with them are shown in table form. Family history Certain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter- ine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami- lies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer \u201cretinoblas- toma,\u201d a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancer known as \u201cearly-onset breast cancer,\u201d have been shown to be linked to certain genes that can be tracked within a family. It is therefore possible that inheriting particular genes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers. Occupational hazards There is evidence to prove that certain occupational hazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam- ple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence of lung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of getting bladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber and gas workers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold miners and arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnish workers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung, bone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura- nium miners. Environment Radiation is believed to cause 1\u20132% of all cancer deaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts for a majority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of radiation are x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation from nuclear material. Pollution Several studies have shown that there is a well- established link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina- tion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk. However, the main danger from pollution occurs when dangerous chemicals from the industries escape into the surrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1% of cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution. Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev- eral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp- toms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occur due to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland. As the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves, organs and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres- sure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer. Despite the fact that there are several hundred differ- ent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms, the ACS has established the following seven symptoms as possible warning signals of cancer: \u2022 changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole \u2022 a sore that does not heal \u2022 persistent cough, hoarseness, or sore throat \u2022 a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere \u2022 unusual bleeding or discharge \u2022 chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing \u2022 any change in bowel or bladder habits Many other diseases, besides cancer, could produce the same symptoms. However, it is important to have these symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especially if they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat- ed, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancers such as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms. Therefore, it is important to undergo routine screening tests such as breast self-exams and mammograms. Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina- tion and a complete medical history. The doctor will observe, feel and palpate (apply pressure by touch) differ- ent parts of the body in order to identify any variations from the normal size, feel and texture of the organ or tissue.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, MPH Colorectal cancer see Colon cancer; Rectal cancer Colostomy Definition Ostomy is a surgical procedure used to create an opening for urine and feces to be released from the body. Colostomy refers to a surgical procedure where a portion of the large intestine is brought through the abdominal wall to carry stool out of the body. Purpose A colostomy is created as a means to treat various disorders of the large intestine, including cancer, obstruc- tion, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured diverticulum, ischemia (compromised blood supply), or traumatic injury. Temporary colostomies are created to divert stool from injured or diseased portions of the large intestine, allowing rest and healing. Permanent colostomies are per- formed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest dis- tance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable. Although colorectal cancer is the most common indica- tion for a permanent colostomy, only about 10\u201315% of patients with this diagnosis require a colostomy. Description Surgery will result in one of three types of colos- tomies: \u2022 End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine (the section of bowel that remains connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the sur- face of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing the intestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin. A stoma is an artificial opening created to the surface of the body. The surface of the stoma is actually the lining of the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink. The distal portion of bowel (now connected only to the rec- tum) may be removed, or sutured closed and left in the abdomen. An end colostomy is usually a permanent ostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another patho- logical condition. \u2022 Double\u2013barrel colostomy. This colsotomy involves the creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall. The proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional end that is connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and will drain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectum and also called a mucous fistula, drains small amounts of mucus material. This is most often a temporary colostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to be later closed. \u2022 Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing a loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominal wall. The loop is held in place outside the abdomen by a plastic rod slipped beneath it. An incision is made in the bowel to allow the passage of stool through the loop colostomy. The supporting rod is removed approxi- mately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing has occurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 861 Colostomy",

Other eye surgeries include the following: \u2022 choroidectomy-removal of part of the choroid, \u2022 iridectomy-removal of part of the iris, \u2022 iridocyclectomy-removal of parts of the ciliary body and parts of iris, \u2022 iridotrabeculectomy-removal of parts of the supporting tissues around the cornea and iris. In eye cancer where the tumor is small and there is a good chance that the vision will be restored less drastic measures than the above surgeries are taken. Radiation and chemotherapy are two courses of treatment that help in killing off the existing tumor and preventing its spread into other areas of the body. Besides radiation and chemotherapy there are other methods of treating eye cancer. Cryotherapy uses extreme cold to destroy the cancer cells. Thermotherapy uses heat to destroy the cancer cells. Photocoagulation uses a laser to destroy blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients. If the tumor isn\u2019t advanced these are good options to treat it in order to avoid losing an eye. A radiation/surgical treatment for eye cancer is brachytherapy. A small plaque with radioactive iodine on one side and gold on the other is stitched to the eye behind the tumor with the radioactive iodine facing the tumor. The gold is used to shield the other tissues from the radiation. It is left there for a period of time depend- ing on the dosage of radiation needed and then it is removed. In this way the tumor is treated and hopefully will shrink and eventually die. Alternative Treatment Other than the treatments above, there aren\u2019t any alternative treatments. New clinical trials are constantly under way to further the treatment of the disease in the future. Prognosis All forms of retinoblastoma and intraocular mela- noma are treatable. Enucleation can usually be avoided if found early enough. The outlook is positive for people with eye cancer. Prevention A good healthy diet and lifestyle are always recom- mended to prevent cancer. Known carcinogens should always be avoided. KEY TERMS Carcinogen\u2014A substance that is known to cause cancer. Cornea\u2014The clear layer that covers the front part of the eye.

Purpose An eye examination is performed by an ophthalmol- ogist M.D. or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy), or an optom- etrist (O.D.) to determine if there are any pre-existing or potential vision problems. Eye exams may also reveal the presence of many non-eye diseases. Many systemic dis- eases can affect the eyes, and since the blood vessels on the retina are observed during the exam, certain problems may be uncovered (e.g., high blood pressure or diabetes). Infants should be examined by a physician to detect any physical abnormalities. Frequency of eye exams then generally differs with age and the health of the person.

In 1996, Streissguth and others published further data regarding the disabilities in children, adolescents and adults with FAS. Secondary disabilities, that is, those dis- abilities not present at birth and that might be preventable with proper diagnosis, treatment, and intervention, were described. These secondary disabilities include: mental health problems; disrupted school experiences; trouble with the law; incarceration for mental health problems, drug abuse, or a crime; inappropriate sexual behavior; alcohol and drug abuse; problems with employment; dependent living; and difficulties parenting their own chil- dren. In that study, only seven out of 90 adults were living and working independently and successfully. In addition to the studies by Streissguth, several other authors in dif- ferent countries have now reported on long term outcome of individuals diagnosed with FAS. In general, the neuro- logic, behavioral and emotional disorders become the most problematic for the individuals. The physical features change over time, sometimes making the correct diagnosis more difficult in older individuals, without old pho- tographs and other historical data to review. Mental health problems including attention deficit, depression, panic attacks, psychosis and suicide threats and attempts, and overall were present in over 90% of the individuals studied by Streissguth. A 1996 study in Germany reported more than 70% of the adolescents they studied had persistent and severe developmental disabilities and many had psy- chiatric disorders, the most common of which were emo- tional disorders, repetitive habits, speech disorders, and hyperactivity disorders. Diagnosis FAS is a clinical diagnosis, which means that there is no blood, x ray or psychological test that can be per- formed to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The diagno- sis is made based on the history of maternal alcohol use, and detailed physical examination for the characteristic major and minor birth defects and characteristic facial features. It is often helpful to examine siblings and par- ents of an individual suspected of having FAS, either in person or by photographs, to determine whether findings on the examination might be familial, of if other siblings may also be affected. Sometimes, genetic tests are per- formed to rule out other conditions that may present with developmental delay or birth defects. Individuals with developmental delay, birth defects or other unusual fea- tures are often referred to a clinical geneticist, develop- mental pediatrician, or neurologist for evaluation and diagnosis of FAS. Psychoeducational testing to deter- mine IQ and/or the presence of learning disabilities may also be part of the evaluation process. KEY TERMS Cleft palate\u2014A congenital malformation in which there is an abnormal opening in the roof of the mouth that allows the nasal passages and the mouth to be improperly connected. Congenital\u2014Refers to a disorder which is present at birth. IQ\u2014Abbreviation for Intelligence Quotient. Com- pares an individual\u2019s mental age to his/her true or chronological age and multiplies that ratio by 100. Microcephaly\u2014An abnormally small head.

Strabismus\u2014An improper muscle balance of the ocular musles resulting in crossed or divergent eyes. Teratogen\u2014Any drug, chemical, maternal disease, or exposure that can cause physical or functional defects in an exposed embryo or fetus. Treatment There is no treatment for FAS that will reverse or change the physical features or brain damage associated with maternal alcohol use during the pregnancy. Most of the birth defects associated with prenatal alcohol expo- sure are correctable with surgery. Children should have psychoeducational evaluation to help plan appropriate educational interventions. Common associated diagnoses such as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, depres- sion, or anxiety should be recognized and treated appro- priately. The disabilities that present during childhood persist into adult life. However, some of the secondary disabilities mentioned above may be avoided or lessened by early and correct diagnosis, better understanding of the life-long complications of FAS, and intervention. Streissguth has describe a model in which an individual affected by FAS has one or more advocates to help pro- vide guidance, structure and support as the individual seeks to become independent, successful in school or employment, and develop satisfying social relationships.

If the urinary stream becomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad- der may cause severe discomfort, a condition called acute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad- der can easily become infected. A burning feeling during urination and fever are clues that infection may have developed. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it may increase pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus- es permanent kidney damage. Diagnosis When a man\u2019s symptoms point to BPH, the first thing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal examination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel whether\u2014and how much\u2014the prostate is enlarged. A smooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis- tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer . The next step is a blood test for a substance called prostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30\u201350% of men with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This does not mean cancer by any means, but other measures are needed to make sure that the prostate enlargement is in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate, which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, can show whether it is enlarged and may show that cancer is present. If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate raises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec- ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. This is usually done using a lance-like instrument that is inserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and, guided by the physcian\u2019s finger, obtains six to eight pieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination. If cancer is present, the prognosis and treatment are changed accordingly. A catheter placed through the urethra and into the bladder can show how much urine remains in the bladder after the patient urinates\u2014a measure of how severe the obstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc- tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter, which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain\u2014 though invasive\u2014way of confirming obstruction from an enlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrument called a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not often necessary. It is routine to check a urine sample for an increased number of white blood cells, which may mean there is infection of the bladder or kidneys. The same sample may be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus- ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best.

Mild infections can be treated by apply- ing one of the drugs to the skin along the tracks and the normal skin surrounding the area. Thiabendazole also can be given internally, but taken this way it can cause side effects including dizziness, nausea, and vomiting Prognosis No matter how severe an infestation, with adequate treatment patients recover completely. However, if the patient scratches the lesions open, the areas can become vulnerable to bacterial infection. Prevention In the United States, the prevalence of dogs and cats with hookworms is the reason why the infective larvae are found so commonly in soil and sand. The play habits of children, together with their attraction to pets, puts them at high risk for hookworm infection and cutaneous larvae migrans. Human hookworm infestation can be prevented by practicing good personal hygiene, deworming pets, and not allowing children to play in potentially contaminated environments.

Turkington Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma Definition Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignan- cy of the T-helper (CD4+) cells of the immune system. KEY TERMS Larvae\u2014Immature forms of certain worms. Description CTCL, also known as mycosis fungoides, is a cancer of the white blood cells that primarily affects the skin and only secondarily affects other sites. This disease involves the uncontrollable proliferation of T-lymphocytes known as T-helper cells, so named because of their role in the immune response. T-helper cells are characterized by the presence of a protein receptor on its surface called CD4. Accordingly, T-helper cells are said to be CD4+. The proliferation of T-helper cells results in the pen- etration, or infiltration, of these abnormal cells into the epidermal layer of the skin. The skin reacts with slightly scaling lesions that itch, although the sites of greatest infiltration do not necessarily correspond to the sites of the lesions. The lesions are most often located on the trunk, but can be present on any part of the body. In the most common course of the disease, the patchy lesions progress to palpable plaques that are deeper red and have more defined edges. As the disease worsens, skin tumors develop that are often mushroom-shaped, hence the name mycosis fungoides. Finally, the cancer progresses to extracutanous involvement, often in the lymph nodes or the viscera. CTCL is a rare disease, with an annual incidence of about 0.29 cases per 100,000 persons in the United States. It is about half as common in Eastern Europe. However, this discrepancy may be attributed to a differ- ing physician awareness of the disease rather than a true difference in occurrence. In the Unites States, there are about 500 to 600 new cases a year and about 100 to 200 deaths. Usually seen in older adults, the median age at diagnosis is 55 to 60 years, and it strikes twice as many men as women. Causes and symptoms The cause of CTCL is unknown. Exposure to chemi- cals or pesticides has been suggested but the most recent study on the subject failed to show a connection between exposure and development of the disease. The ability to isolate various viruses from cell lines grown from cells of CTCL patients raises the question of a viral cause, but studies have been unable to confirm these suspicions. The symptoms of CTCL are seen primarily in the skin, with itchy red patches or plaques and, usually over time, mushroom-shaped skin tumors. Any part of the skin can be involved and the extent and distribution of the rash or tumors vary greatly from patient to patient. The only really universal symptom of the disease is the itch and this symptom is usually what brings the patient to the doctor for treatment. If the disease spreads outside of the skin, the symptoms include swelling of the lymph GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 975 Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma",

          "content": "Genes from a small blood or tissue sample are analyzed for specific mutations; presence of two copies of the mutated gene confirms the diagnosis of CF in all but a very few cases. However, since there are so many differ- ent possible mutations, and since testing for all of them would be too expensive and time-consuming, a negative gene test cannot rule out the possibility of CF. Couples planning a family may decide to have them- selves tested if one or both have a family history of CF. Prenatal genetic testing is possible through amniocente- sis. Many couples who already have one child with CF decide to undergo prenatal screening in subsequent preg- nancies, and use the results to determine whether to ter- minate the pregnancy. Siblings in these families are also usually tested, both to determine if they will develop CF, and to determine if they are carriers, to aid in their own family planning. If the sibling has no symptoms, deter- mining his carrier status is often delayed until his teen years or later, when he is closer to needing the informa- tion to make decisions. Newborn screening Some states now require screening of newborns for CF, using a test known as the IRT test. This is a blood test which measures the level of immunoreactive trypsino- gen, which is generally higher in babies with CF than those without it. This test gives many false positive results immediately after birth, and so requires a second test several weeks later. A second positive result is usual- ly followed by a sweat test. Treatment There is no cure for CF. Treatment has advanced con- siderably in the past several decades, increasing both the life span and the quality of life for most people affected by CF. Early diagnosis is important to prevent malnutri- tion and infection from weakening the young child. With proper management, many people with CF engage in the full range of school and sports activities. Nutrition People with CF usually require high-calorie diets and vitamin supplements. Height, weight, and growth of a person with CF are monitored regularly. Most people with CF need to take pancreatic enzymes to supplement or replace the inadequate secretions of the pancreas. Tablets containing pancreatic enzymes are taken with every meal; depending on the size of the tablet and the meal, as many as 20 tablets may be needed. Because of incomplete absorption even with pancreatic enzymes, a person with CF needs to take in about 30% more food than a person without CF. Low-fat diets are not recom- mended except in special circumstances, since fat is a source of both essential fatty acids and abundant calories. Some people with CF cannot absorb enough nutri- ents from the foods they eat, even with specialized diets and enzymes. For these people, tube feeding is an option. Nutrients can be introduced directly into the stomach through a tube inserted either through the nose (a naso- gastric tube) or through the abdominal wall (a gastrosto- my tube). A jejunostomy tube, inserted into the small intestine, is also an option. Tube feeding can provide nutrition at any time, including at night while the person is sleeping, allowing constant intake of high-quality nutrients. The feeding tube may be removed during the day, allowing normal meals to be taken. Respiratory health The key to maintaining respiratory health in a person with CF is regular monitoring and early treatment. Lung function tests are done frequently to track changes in functional lung volume and respiratory effort. Sputum samples are analyzed to determine the types of bacteria present in the lungs. Chest x rays are usually taken at least once a year. Lung scans, using a radioactive gas, can show closed off areas not seen on the x ray. Circula- tion in the lungs may be monitored by injection of a radioactive substance into the bloodstream. People with CF live with chronic bacterial coloniza- tion; that is, their lungs are constantly host to several species of bacteria. Good general health, especially good nutrition, can keep the immune system healthy, which decreases the frequency with which these colonies begin an infection, or attack on the lung tissue. Exercise is anoth- er important way to maintain health, and people with CF are encouraged to maintain a program of regular exercise. In addition, clearing mucus from the lungs helps to prevent infection; and mucus control is an important aspect of CF management. Postural drainage is used to allow gravity to aid the mucociliary escalator. For this technique, the person with CF lies on a tilted surface with head downward, alternately on the stomach, back, or side, depending on the section of lung to be drained. An assis- tant thumps the rib cage to help loosen the secretions. A device called a \u201cflutter\u201d offers another way to loosen secretions: it consists of a stainless steel ball in a tube. When a person exhales through it, the ball vibrates, send- ing vibrations back through the air in the lungs. Some spe- cial breathing techniques may also help clear the lungs. Several drugs are available to prevent the airways from becoming clogged with mucus. Bronchodilators and theophyllines open up the airways; steroids reduce inflammation; and mucolytics loosen secretions. Acetyl- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 988 Cystic fibrosis",

When treat- ed with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure, many patients in the study had marked improvements in their CFS symptoms. Diagnosis CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim- inating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques- tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses they have had, and medications they are taking. They also conduct a physical examination , neurological examination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly- ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the United States, many doctors use the CDC case definition to determine if a patient has CFS. To be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both of the following criteria: \u2022 Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for at least six months that is of new or definite onset, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly relieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational, social, or personal activities to be greatly reduced. \u2022 Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short- term memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following exercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more than 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must not have started before the fatigue began. Treatment There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual- ly are individualized to each person\u2019s particular symp- toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom- mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced diet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and resting when needed are key to maintaining existing energy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to keep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too much exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp- toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also may help some people with CFS. Many medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal preparations have been used to treat CFS. While many of these are unproven, others seem to provide some people with relief. People with CFS should discuss their treatment KEY TERMS Arthralgia\u2014Joint pain.

          "content": "cysteine (Mucomyst) has been used as a mucolytic for many years but is not prescribe frequently now, while DNase (Pulmozyme) is a newer product gaining in popu- larity. DNase breaks down the DNA from dead white blood cells and bacteria found in thick mucus. People with CF may pick up bacteria from other CF patients. This is especially true of Burkholderia cepacia, which is not usually found in people without CF. While the ideal recommendation from a health standpoint might be to avoid contact with others who have CF, this is not usually practical (since CF clinics are a major site of care), nor does it meet the psychological and social needs of many people with CF. At a minimum, CF centers recom- mend avoiding prolonged close contact between people with CF, and scrupulous hygiene, including frequent hand washing. Some CF clinics schedule appointments on dif- ferent days for those with and without B. cepaciacolonies. Some doctors choose to prescribe antibiotics only dur- ing infection, while others prefer long-term antibiotic treat- ment against S. aureus. The choice of antibiotic depends on the particular organism or organisms found. Some antibi- otics are given as aerosols directly into the lungs. Antibiotic treatment may be prolonged and aggressive. Supplemental oxygen may be needed as lung dis- ease progresses. Respiratory failure may develop, requiring temporary use of a ventilator to perform the work of breathing. Lung transplantation has become increasingly common for people with CF, although the number of people who receive them is still much lower than those who want them. Transplantation is not a cure, however, and has been likened to trading one disease for another. Long-term immunosuppression is required, increasing the likelihood of other types of infection. About 50% of adults and more than 80% of children who receive lung transplants live longer than two years. Liver transplants are also done for CF patients whose livers have been damaged by fibrosis. Long-term use of ibuprofen has been shown to help some people with CF, presumably by reducing inflam- mation in the lungs. Close medical supervision is neces- sary, however, since the effective dose is high and not everyone benefits. Ibuprofen at the required doses inter- feres with kidney function, and together with aminogly- coside antibiotics, may cause kidney failure. A number of experimental treatments are currently the subject of much research. Some evidence indicates that aminoglycoside antibiotics may help overcome the genetic defect in some CF mutations, allowing the pro- tein to be made normally. While promising, these results would apply to only about 5% of those with CF. Gene therapy is currently the most ambitious approach to curing CF. In this set of techniques, non- defective copies of the CFTR gene are delivered to affected cells, where they are taken up and used to create the CFTR protein. While elegant and simple in theory, gene therapy has met with a large number of difficulties in trials so far, including immune resistance, very short duration of the introduced gene, and inadequately wide- spread delivery. Alternative treatment In homeopathic medicine, the symptoms of the disease would be addressed to enhance the quality of life for the person with cystic fibrosis. Treating the cause of CF, because of the genetic basis for the disease, is not possible. Homeopathic medicine seeks to treat the whole person, however, and in CF, this approach might include: \u2022 mucolytics to help thin mucous \u2022 supplementation of pancreatic enzymes to assist in digestion \u2022 respiratory symptoms can be addressed to open lung passages \u2022 hydrotherapy techniques to help ease the respiratory symptoms and help the body eliminate \u2022 immune enhancements can help revent the develop- ment of secondary infections \u2022 dietary enhancements and adjustments are used to treat digestive and nutritional problems Prognosis People with CF may lead relatively normal lives with the control of symptoms. The possible effect of pregnancy on the health of a woman with CF requires careful consid- eration before beginning a family as do issues of longevi- ty and their children\u2019s status as carriers. Although most men with CF are functionally sterile, new procedures for removing sperm from the testes are being tried, and may offer more men the chance to become fathers. Approximately half of people with CF live past the age of 30. Because of better and earlier treatment, a per- son born today with CF is expected, on average, to live to age 40. Prevention Adults with a family history of cystic fibrosis may obtain a genetic test of their carrier status for purposes of family planning. Prenatal testing is also available. There is currently no known way to prevent development of CF in a person with two defective gene copies. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 989 Cystic fibrosis",

          "content": "Laboratory tests After taking the woman\u2019s history, the gynecologist or family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Pap smear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding, the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood tests to check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini- tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter- mine the level of other hormones that play a role in reproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenal function test are also commonly done. Imaging Imaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval- uating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina- tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to help locate uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyoma, a type of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy\u2014 where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly into the uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining\u2014is also used to assess the condition of the uterus. Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial polyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer. In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast media has been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to locate fibroids and tumors. Invasive procedures Endometrial biopsy (the removal and examination of endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce- dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter- ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to be sampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities. Dilation and curettage (D & C), once common is rarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done while the patient is under either general or regional anesthesia. Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as part of the diagnostic procedure, than younger women. Because DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other possible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time and involve many tests and procedures. Older women are likely to need more extensive tests than adolescents because the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greater in this age group, and therefore must be definitively eliminated before treating bleeding symptoms. Treatment Treatment of DUB depends on the cause of the bleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlying cause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated. KEY TERMS Dilation and curettage (D & C) \u2014A procedure performed under anesthesia during which the cervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus is scraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrument or a suction tube. The procedure can be either diagnostic, or to remove polyps. Endometrial biopsy \u2014The removal of tissue either by suction or scraping of samples of tissue from the uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedure has a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D & C, but can be done as an office procedure under local anesthesia. Endometrial cancer\u2014Cancer of the inner mucous membrane of the uterus. Fibroids, or fibroid tumors \u2014Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus. They occur in 30\u201340% of women over age 40, and do not need to be removed unless they are causing symptoms that interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities. Hypothyroidism\u2014A disorder in which the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone causing a decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat- ed effects on the reproductive system. Lupus erythematosus \u2014A chronic inflammatory disease in which inappropriate immune system reactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels and connective tissue. Progesterone \u2014A hormone naturally secreted by the ovary, or manufactured synthetically, that prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil- ized egg. Prostaglandins \u2014A group of chemicals that medi- ate, or determine the actions of other chemicals in the cell or body. Otherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp- toms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities or cause anemia. Generally the first approach to controlling DUB is to use oral contraceptives that provide a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep- tives are often very effective in adolescents and young women in their twenties. NSAIDs ( nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ), like Naprosyn and Motrin, are also used to treat DUB. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1113 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding",

          "content": "tion where a doctor believes that a person has mononu- cleosis and the heterophile test (also called the monospot test) is positive. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last- ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn- drome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic- ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer appears to be the case. Precautions As in any blood test, standard precautions should be performed to prevent infection at the site where the blood is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally, the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the blood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and syringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres- sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped. Description These tests are more often performed in a consulting laboratory than at a physician\u2019s office or in a hospital laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the whole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can be detected against several components of the Epstein- Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif- ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages) of the virus\u2019 growth. At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus, antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six months only. This antibody, however, persists substan- tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti- body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV occurred in the past. Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA can be found. Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable amounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which might be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship very unlikely. Preparation The skin area from which the blood sample will be obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or iodine. Aftercare The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test. Usually, pressure is applied to the area for several moments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult to interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after waiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts of antibody detected between the two tests can be particu- larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis. Risks There are no risks over and above those of having blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are more expensive than many other blood tests but are usually covered by medical insurance. Normal results The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to determine whether the person has not had infection with EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current- ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or has had first time infection with EBV sometime in the past (more than six months ago). If one defines \u201cnormal\u201d results as either not having EBV in the past, and call that category one; or having had it in the past, and call that category two. Most young children below the age of five will fall into category one, while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into category two. The results for susceptibility are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative \u2022 antibody to EBNA = Negative The results for past infection are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative (90% of time) \u2022 antibody to VCA IgM = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA IgG = positive \u2022 antibody to EBNA = positive It is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus, like all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leave the body after the patient recovers from illness.

          "content": "Pseudomonas cepacia .) The fungus Aspergillus fumiga- tus may infect older children and adults. The body\u2019s response to infection is to increase mucus production; white blood cells fighting the infec- tion thicken the mucus even further as they break down and release their cell contents. These white blood cells also provoke more inflammation, continuing the down- ward spiral that marks untreated CF. As mucus accumulates, it can plug up the smaller passageways in the lungs, decreasing functional lung volume. Getting enough air can become difficult; tired- ness, shortness of breath , and intolerance of exercise become more common. Because air passes obstructions more easily during inhalation than during exhalation, over time, air becomes trapped in the smallest chambers of the lungs, the alveoli. As millions of alveoli gradually expand, the chest takes on the enlarged, barrel-shaped appearance typical of emphysema. For unknown reasons, recurrent respiratory infec- tions lead to \u201cdigital clubbing,\u201d in which the last joint of the fingers and toes becomes slightly enlarged. SWEAT GLANDS. The CFTR protein helps to regulate the amount of salt in sweat. People with CF have sweat that is much saltier than normal, and measuring the salti- ness of a person\u2019s sweat is the most important diagnostic test for CF. Parents may notice that their infants taste salty when they kiss them. Excess salt loss is not usually a prob- lem except during prolonged exercise or heat. While most older children and adults with CF compensate for this extra salt loss by eating more salty foods, infants and young children are in danger of suffering its effects (such as heat prostration), especially during summer. Heat pros- tration is marked by lethargy, weakness, and loss of appetite, and should be treated as an emergency condition. FERTILITY. Ninety-eight percent of men with CF are sterile, due to complete obstruction or absence of the vas deferens, the tube carrying sperm out of the testes. While boys and men with CF form normal sperm and have nor- mal levels of sex hormones, sperm are unable to leave the testes, and fertilization is not possible. Most women with CF are fertile, though they often have more trouble get- ting pregnant than women without CF. In both boys and girls, puberty is often delayed, most likely due to the effects of poor nutrition or chronic lung infection. Women with good lung health usually have no problems with pregnancy , while those with ongoing lung infec- tion often do poorly.

A child born with meconium ileus will be tested before leaving the hospi- tal. Families with a history of CF may wish to have all children tested, especially if there is a child who already has the disease. Some hospitals now require routine screening of newborns for CF. Sweat test The sweat test is both the easiest and most accurate test for CF. In this test, a small amount of the drug pilo- carpine is placed on the skin. A very small electrical cur- rent is then applied to the area, which drives the pilo- carpine into the skin. The drug stimulates sweating in the treated area. The sweat is absorbed onto a piece of filter paper, and is then analyzed for its salt content. A person with CF will have salt concentrations that are one-and- one-half to two times greater than normal. The test can be done on persons of any age, including newborns, and its results can be determined within an hour. Virtually every person who has CF will test positively on it, and virtually everyone who does not will test negatively. Genetic testing The discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989 allowed the development of an accurate genetic test for CF. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 987 Cystic fibrosis",

          "content": "Meconium is the first dark stool that a baby passes after birth; ileus is an obstruction of the digestive tract. The meconium of a newborn with meconium ileus is thick- ened and sticky, due to the presence of thickened mucus from the intestinal glands. Meconium ileus causes abdominal swelling and vomiting, and often requires surgery immediately after birth. Presence of meconium ileus is considered highly indicative of CF. Borderline cases may be misdiagnosed, however, and attributed instead to \u201cmilk allergy.\u201d Other abdominal symptoms are caused by the inabil- ity of the pancreas to supply digestive enzymes to the intestine. During normal digestion, as food passes from the stomach into the small intestine, it is mixed with pan- creatic secretions which help to break down the nutrients for absorption. While the intestines themselves also pro- vide some digestive enzymes, the pancreas is the major source of enzymes for the digestion of all types of foods, especially fats and proteins. In CF, thick mucus blocks the pancreatic duct, which is eventually closed off completely by scar tissue formation, leading to a condition known as pancreatic insufficiency. Without pancreatic enzymes, large amounts of undigested food pass into the large intes- tine. Bacterial action on this rich food source can cause gas and abdominal swelling. The large amount of fat remaining in the feces makes it bulky, oily, and foul- smelling. Because nutrients are only poorly digested and absorbed, the person with CF is often ravenously hungry, underweight, and shorter than expected for his age. When CF is not treated for a longer period, a child may develop symptoms of malnutrition, including anemia, bloating, and, paradoxically, appetite loss. Diabetes becomes increasingly likely as a person with CF ages. Scarring of the pancreas slowly destroys those pancreatic cells which produce insulin, producing type I, or insulin-dependent diabetes. Gall stones affect approximately 10% of adults with CF. Liver problems are less common, but can be caused by the buildup of fat within the liver. Complications of liver enlargement may include internal hemorrhaging, abdomi- nal fluid (ascites), spleen enlargement, and liver failure. Other gastrointestinal symptoms can include a pro- lapsed rectum, in which part of the rectal lining protrudes through the anus; intestinal obstruction; and rarely, intussusception, in which part of the intestinal tube slips over an adjoining part, cutting off blood supply. Somewhat less than 10% of people with CF do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. Most of these people do not have the delta-F508 mutation, but rather a different one, which presumably allows at least some of their CFTR proteins to function normally in the pancreas. RESPIRATORY TRACT. The respiratory tract includes the nose, the throat, the trachea (or windpipe), the bronchi (which branch off from the trachea within each lung), the smaller bronchioles, and the blind sacs called alveoli, in which gas exchange takes place between air and blood. Swelling of the sinuses within the nose is common in people with CF. This usually shows up on x-ray, and may aid the diagnosis of CF. However, this swelling, called pansinusitis, rarely causes problems, and does not usually require treatment. Nasal polyps , or growths, affect about one in five people with CF. These growths are not cancerous, and do not require removal unless they become annoying. While nasal polyps appear in older people without CF, especially those with allergies, they are rare in children without CF. The lungs are the site of the most life-threatening effects of CF. The production of a thick, sticky mucus increases the likelihood of infection, decreases the abil- ity to protect against infection, causes inflammation and swelling, decreases the functional capacity of the lungs, and may lead to emphysema. People with CF will live with chronic populations of bacteria in their lungs, and lung infection is the major cause of death for those with CF. The bronchioles and bronchi normally produce a thin, clear mucus that traps foreign particles including bacteria and viruses. Tiny hair-like projections on the surface of these passageways slowly sweep the mucus along, out of the lungs and up the trachea to the back of the throat, where it may be swallowed or coughed up. This \u201cmucociliary escalator\u201d is one of the principal defenses against lung infection. The thickened mucus of CF prevents easy movement out of the lungs, and increases the irritation and inflam- mation of lung tissue. This inflammation swells the pas- sageways, partially closing them down, further hamper- ing the movement of mucus. A person with CF is likely to cough more frequently and more vigorously as the lungs attempt to clean themselves out. At the same time, infection becomes more likely since the mucus is a rich source of nutrients. Bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia are frequent in CF. The most common infecting organisms are the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , Haemophilus influenzae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .

Lohr, PhD Cystic fibrosis Definition Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects the lungs, digestive system, sweat glands, and male fertility. Its name derives from the fibrous scar tis- sue that develops in the pancreas, one of the principal organs affected by the disease. Description Cystic fibrosis affects the body\u2019s ability to move salt and water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungs and pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage- ways and preventing proper function. CF affects approximately 30,000 children and young adults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies are born with CF every year. CF primarily affects people of white northern-European descent; rates are much lower in non-white populations. Many of the symptoms of CF can be treated with drugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to and prompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica- tions have dramatically increased the expected life span of a person with CF. While several decades ago most children with CF died by age two, today about half of all people with CF live past age 31. That median age is expected to grow as new treatments are developed, and it is estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has a median expected life span of 40 years. Causes and symptoms Causes Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease, meaning it is caused by a defect in the person\u2019s genes. Genes, found in the nucleus of all the body\u2019s cells, control cell function by serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins. Proteins carry out a wide variety of functions within cells. The gene that, when defective, causes CF, is called the CFTR gene, which stands for cystic fibrosis trans- membrane conductance regulator. A simple defect in this gene leads to all the consequences of CF. There are over 500 known defects in the CFTR gene that can cause CF. However, 70% of all people with a defective CFTR gene have the same defect, known as delta-F508. Much as sentences are composed of long strings of words, each made of letters; genes can be thought of as long strings of chemical words, each made of chemical letters, called nucleotides. Just as a sentence can be changed by rearranging its letters, genes can be mutated, or changed, by changes in the sequence of their nucleotide letters. The gene defects in CF are called point mutations, meaning that the gene is mutated only at one small spot along its length. In other words, the delta- F508 mutation is a loss of one \u201cletter\u201d out of thousands within the CFTR gene. As a result, the CFTR protein made from its blueprint is made incorrectly, and cannot perform its function properly. The CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is a complex mixture of salts, water, sugars, and proteins that cleanses, lubricates, and protects many passageways in the body, including those in the lungs and pancreas. The role of the CFTR protein is to allow chloride ions to exit the mucus-producing cells. When the chloride ions leave these cells, water follows, thinning the mucus. In this way, the CFTR protein helps to keep mucus from becoming thick and sluggish, thus allowing the mucus to be moved steadi- ly along the passageways to aid in cleansing. In CF, the CFTR protein cannot allow chloride ions out of the mucus-producing cells. With less chloride leaving, less water leaves, and the mucus becomes thick and sticky. It can no longer move freely through the pas- sageways, so they become clogged. In the pancreas, clogged passageways prevent secretion of digestive enzymes into the intestine, causing serious impairment of digestion\u2014especially of fat\u2014which may lead to mal- nutrition. Mucus in the lungs may plug the airways, pre- venting good air exchange and, ultimately, leading to emphysema. The mucus is also a rich source of nutrients for bacteria, leading to frequent infections. INHERITANCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. To understand the inheritance pattern of CF, it is important to realize that genes actually have two functions. First, as noted above, they serve as the blueprint for the production of proteins. Second, they are the material of inheritance: parents pass on characteristics to their children by combining the genes in egg and sperm to make a new individual.

          "content": "\u2022 mood disturbance, possibly including anxiety, eupho- ria or depression \u2022 language or speech impairment Diagnosis Delirium is diagnosed through the medical history and recognition of symptoms during mental status examination . The most important part of diagnosis is determining the cause of the delirium. Tests may include blood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec- trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum- bar puncture (\u201cspinal tap\u201d) to test for central nervous system infection; x ray, computed tomography scans (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali- ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec- trocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated by the likely cause. Treatment Treatment of delirium begins with recognizing and treating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managed by reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothing ones; use of simple, clear language in communication; and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi- cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger to himself or others, or if he insists on removing necessary medical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors. Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions. Prognosis Persons with delirium usually have a worse prog- nosis for the underlying disease than the person with- out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill- ness usually recover from delirium. They may not, however, regain all their original cognitive abilities, and may be left with some permanent impairments, including fatigue , irritability, difficulty concentrating, or mood changes. Prevention Prevention of delirium is focused on treating or avoiding its underlying causes. The most preventable forms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducing delirium include following prescriptions, consulting the prescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur, and consulting the physician before discontinuing the drug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica- tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professional assistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive drug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri- tion, which promotes general health and can minimize the likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication and withdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti- cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home or workplace.

Richard Robinson Delta virus hepatitis see Hepatitis D Delusions Definition A delusion is an unshakable belief in something untrue. These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning, and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre- sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompanied by hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia , which act to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusions are distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefs that may be seen as untrue by outsiders. Description Delusions are a common symptom of several mood and personality-related mental illnesses, including schizoaffective disorder , schizophrenia , shared psy- chotic disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder . They are also the major feature of delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder suffer from long-term, complex delusions that fall into one of six categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero- tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusional disorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or physical causes. Persecutory Individuals with persecutory delusional disorder are plagued by feelings of paranoia and an irrational yet unshakable belief that someone is plotting against them, or out to harm them.

          "content": "There are many possible causes of FUO; generally though, a diagnosis can be found. About 10% of patients will wind up without a definite cause, and about the same percentage have \u201cfactitious fevers\u201d (either self induced or no fever at all). Some general symptoms tend to occur along with fever; these are called constitutional symptoms and con- sist of myalgias (muscle aches), chills, and headache. Diagnosis Few symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos- tic challenge as fever. Nonetheless, if a careful, logical, and thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will be found in most cases. The patient\u2019s past medical history as well as travel, social, and family history should be care- fully searched for important clues. Usually the first step is to search for an infectious cause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such as tuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool, are generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number of infectious agents can be measured; if these are rising, they may point to an active infection. Various x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to standard examinations, recently developed radiological techniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scans are now available. These enable physicians to examine areas that were once accessible only through surgery. Fur- thermore, new studies using radioactive materials (nuclear medicine), can detect areas of infection and inflammation previously almost impossible to find, even with surgery. Biopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray exam can be performed by either traditional or newer surgical techniques. Material obtained by biopsy is then examined by a pathologist to look for clues as to the cause of the fever. Evidence of infection, tumor or other diseases can be found in this way. Portions of the biopsy are also sent to the laboratory for culture in an attempt to grow and identify an infectious organism. Patients with HIV are an especially difficult prob- lem, as they often suffer from many unusual infections. HIV itself is a potential cause of fever. Treatment Most patients who undergo evaluation for FUO do not receive treatment until a clear-cut cause is found. Antibi- otics or medications designed to suppress a fever (such as NSAIDs) will only hide the true cause. Once physicians are satisfied that there is no infectious cause, they may use med- ications such as NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to decrease inflammation and diminish constitutional symptoms. The development of FUO in certain settings, such as that acquired by patients in the hospital or in those with a low white blood count , often needs rapid treatment to avoid serious complications. Therefore, in these instances patients may be placed on antibiotics after a minimal number of diagnostic studies. Once test results are known, treatment can be adjusted as needed. Prognosis The outlook for patients with FUO depends on the cause of the fever. If the basic illness is easily treatable and can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cure is quite good. Some patients continue with temperature elevations for six months or more; if no serious disease is found, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decrease the effects of the fever. Careful follow-up and reevalua- tion is recommended in these cases. Resources BOOKS Gelfand, Jeffrey A., and Charles A.

          "content": "tion where a doctor believes that a person has mononu- cleosis and the heterophile test (also called the monospot test) is positive. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last- ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn- drome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic- ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer appears to be the case. Precautions As in any blood test, standard precautions should be performed to prevent infection at the site where the blood is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally, the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the blood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and syringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres- sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped. Description These tests are more often performed in a consulting laboratory than at a physician\u2019s office or in a hospital laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the whole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can be detected against several components of the Epstein- Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif- ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages) of the virus\u2019 growth. At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus, antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six months only. This antibody, however, persists substan- tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti- body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV occurred in the past. Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA can be found. Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable amounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which might be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship very unlikely. Preparation The skin area from which the blood sample will be obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or iodine. Aftercare The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test. Usually, pressure is applied to the area for several moments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult to interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after waiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts of antibody detected between the two tests can be particu- larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis. Risks There are no risks over and above those of having blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are more expensive than many other blood tests but are usually covered by medical insurance. Normal results The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to determine whether the person has not had infection with EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current- ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or has had first time infection with EBV sometime in the past (more than six months ago). If one defines \u201cnormal\u201d results as either not having EBV in the past, and call that category one; or having had it in the past, and call that category two. Most young children below the age of five will fall into category one, while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into category two. The results for susceptibility are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative \u2022 antibody to EBNA = Negative The results for past infection are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative (90% of time) \u2022 antibody to VCA IgM = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA IgG = positive \u2022 antibody to EBNA = positive It is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus, like all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leave the body after the patient recovers from illness.

          "content": "Laboratory tests After taking the woman\u2019s history, the gynecologist or family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Pap smear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding, the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood tests to check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini- tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter- mine the level of other hormones that play a role in reproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenal function test are also commonly done. Imaging Imaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval- uating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina- tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to help locate uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyoma, a type of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy\u2014 where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly into the uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining\u2014is also used to assess the condition of the uterus. Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial polyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer. In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast media has been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to locate fibroids and tumors. Invasive procedures Endometrial biopsy (the removal and examination of endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce- dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter- ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to be sampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities. Dilation and curettage (D & C), once common is rarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done while the patient is under either general or regional anesthesia. Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as part of the diagnostic procedure, than younger women. Because DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other possible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time and involve many tests and procedures. Older women are likely to need more extensive tests than adolescents because the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greater in this age group, and therefore must be definitively eliminated before treating bleeding symptoms. Treatment Treatment of DUB depends on the cause of the bleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlying cause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated. KEY TERMS Dilation and curettage (D & C) \u2014A procedure performed under anesthesia during which the cervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus is scraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrument or a suction tube. The procedure can be either diagnostic, or to remove polyps. Endometrial biopsy \u2014The removal of tissue either by suction or scraping of samples of tissue from the uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedure has a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D & C, but can be done as an office procedure under local anesthesia. Endometrial cancer\u2014Cancer of the inner mucous membrane of the uterus. Fibroids, or fibroid tumors \u2014Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus. They occur in 30\u201340% of women over age 40, and do not need to be removed unless they are causing symptoms that interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities. Hypothyroidism\u2014A disorder in which the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone causing a decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat- ed effects on the reproductive system. Lupus erythematosus \u2014A chronic inflammatory disease in which inappropriate immune system reactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels and connective tissue. Progesterone \u2014A hormone naturally secreted by the ovary, or manufactured synthetically, that prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil- ized egg. Prostaglandins \u2014A group of chemicals that medi- ate, or determine the actions of other chemicals in the cell or body. Otherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp- toms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities or cause anemia. Generally the first approach to controlling DUB is to use oral contraceptives that provide a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep- tives are often very effective in adolescents and young women in their twenties. NSAIDs ( nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ), like Naprosyn and Motrin, are also used to treat DUB. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1113 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding",

          "content": "Description Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a disorder that occurs most frequently in women at the beginning and end of their reproductive lives. About half the cases occur in women over 45 years of age, and about one fifth occur in women under age 20. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed when other causes of uterine bleeding have been eliminated. Failure of the ovary to release an egg during the menstru- al cycle occurs in about 70% of women with DUB. This is probably related to a hormonal imbalance. DUB is common in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (cysts on the ovaries). Women who are on dialysis may also have heavy or prolonged periods. So do some women who use an intrauterine device ( IUD) for birth control. DUB is similar to several other types of uterine bleed- ing disorders and sometimes overlaps these conditions. Menorrhagia Menorrhagia, sometimes called hypermenorrhea, is another term for abnormally long, heavy periods. This type of period can be a symptom of DUB, or many other diseases or disorders. In menorrhagia, menstrual periods occur regularly, but last more than seven days, and blood loss exceeds 3 oz (88.7 ml). Passing blood clots is com- mon. Between 15\u201320% of healthy women experience debilitating menorrhagia that interferes with their normal activities. Menorrhagia may or may not signify a serious underlying problem. Metrorrhagia Metrorrhagia is bleeding between menstrual periods. Bleeding is heavy and irregular as opposed to ovulatory spotting which is light bleeding, in mid-cycle, at the time of ovulation. Polymenorrhea Polymenorrhea describes the condition of having too frequent periods. Periods occur more often than every 21 days, and ovulation usually does not occur dur- ing the cycle. Causes and symptoms Dysfunctional uterine bleeding often occurs when the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, is stimulated to grow by the hormone estrogen. When exposure to estro- gen is extended, or not balanced by the presence of prog- esterone, the endometrium continues to grow until it out- grows its blood supply. Then it sloughs off, causing irregular bleeding. If the bleeding is heavy enough and frequent enough, anemia can result. Menorrhagia is representative of DUB. It is caused by many conditions including some outside the repro- ductive system. Causes of menorrhagia include: \u2022 adenomyosis (a benign condition characterized by growths in the area of the uterus) \u2022 imbalance between the hormones estrogen and proges- terone \u2022 fibroid tumors \u2022 pelvic infection \u2022 endometrial cancer (cancer of the inner mucous membrane of the uterus) \u2022 endometrial polyps \u2022 endometriosis (a condition in which endometrial or endrometrial-like tissue appears outside of its normal place in the uterus) \u2022 use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception \u2022 hypothyroidism \u2022 blood clotting problems (rare) \u2022 lupus erythematosus \u2022 pelvic inflammatory disease \u2022 steroid therapy \u2022 advanced liver disease \u2022 renal (kidney) disease \u2022 chemotherapy (cancer treatment with chemicals) To diagnose dysfunctional uterine bleeding, many of the potential causes mentioned above must be eliminat- ed. When all potential causes connected with pregnancy, infection, and tumors (benign or malignant) are eliminat- ed, then menorrhagia is presumed to be caused by dys- functional uterine bleeding. Diagnosis Diagnosis of any menstrual irregularity begins with the patient herself. The doctor will ask for a detailed description of the problem, and take a history of how long it has existed, and any patterns the patient has observed. A woman can assist the doctor in diagnosing the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding by keeping a record of the time, frequency, length, and quantity of bleeding. She should also tell the doctor about any ill- nesses, including long-standing conditions, like diabetes mellitus. The doctor will also inquire about sexual activ- ity, use of contraceptives, current medications, and past surgical procedures. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1112 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding",

          "content": "When bleeding cannot be controlled by hormone treatment, surgery may be necessary. Dilation and curet- tage sometimes relieves the symptoms of DUB. If that fails, endometrial ablation removes the uterine lining, but preserves a woman\u2019s uterus. This procedure is sometimes be used instead of hysterectomy. However, as it affects the uterus, it can only be used when a woman has com- pleted her childbearing years. The prescription of iron is also important to decrease the risk of enemia. Until the 1980s, hysterectomy often was used to treat heavy uterine bleeding. Today hysterectomy is used less frequently to treat DUB, and then only after other methods of controlling the symptoms have failed. A hys- terectomy leaves a woman unable to bear children, and, therefore, is limited largely to women who are unable to, or uninterested in, bearing children. Still, hysterectomy is a common treatment for long-standing DUB in women done with childbearing. Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners concentrate on good nutri- tion as a way to prevent heavy periods that are not caused by uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, or cancer. Iron supplementation (100 mg per day) not only helps prevent anemia, but also appears to reduce menor- rhagia in many women. Other recommended dietary sup- plements include vitamins A and C. Vitamin C improves capillary fragility and enhances iron uptake. Vitamin E and bioflavonoid supplements are also recommended. Vitamin E can help reduce blood flow, and bioflavonoids help strengthen the capillaries. Vita- min K is known to play a role in clotting and is helpful in situations where heavy bleeding may be due to clotting abnormalities Botanical medicines used to assist in treating abnor- mal bleeding include spotted cranesbill (Geranium macu- latum), birthroot ( Trillium pendulum ), blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides ), witch hazel ( Hamamelis virginiana), shepherd\u2019s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris ), and yarrow ( Achillea millifolia ). These are all stiptic herbs that act to tighten blood vessels and tissue. Hor- monal balance can also be addressed with herbal formula- tions containing phytoestrogens and phytoprogesterone. Prognosis Response to treatment for DUB is highly individual and is not easy to predict. The outcome depends largely on the woman\u2019s medical condition and her age. Many women, especially adolescents, are successfully treated with hormones (usually oral contraceptives). As a last resort, hysterectomy removes the source of the problem by removing the uterus, but this operation is not without risk, or the possibility of complications.

Tish Davidson Dyslexia Definition Dyslexia is a learning disability characterized by problems in reading, spelling, writing, speaking, or lis- tening. In many cases, dyslexia appears to be inherited. Description The word dyslexia is derived from the Greek word, dys (meaning poor or inadequate) and the word lexis (meaning words or language). The National Institutes of Health estimates that about 15% of the United States population is affected by learning disabilities, mostly with problems in lan- guage and reading. The condition appears in all ages, races, and income levels. Dyslexia is not a disease, but describes rather a different kind of mind that learns in a different way from other people. Many people with the condition are gifted and very productive; dyslexia is not at all linked to low intelligence. In fact, intelligence has nothing to do with dyslexia. Dyslexic children seem to have trouble learning early reading skills, problems hearing individual sounds in words, analyzing whole words in parts, and blending sounds into words. Letters such as \u201cd\u201d and \u201cb\u201d may be confused. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21114 Dyslexia",

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test.

Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do not involve radiation levels that are harmful to the unborn baby. Description Manometry This study is designed to measure the pressure changes produced by contraction of the muscular por- tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function of any one of the segments of the swallowing tube causes difficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys- phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating those patients whose endoscopy is negative. During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube carrying a device that senses changes in pressures in the esophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal- lowing. Medications are sometimes given during the study to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans- mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can best identify diseases that produce disturbances of motility or contractions of the esophagus. Esophageal pH monitoring This procedure involves measuring the esophagus\u2019 exposure to acid that has \u201crefluxed\u201d from the stomach. The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn or GERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, but also ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing (strictures) when they heal. Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux. Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp- tying and production of saliva are other important protec- tive mechanisms. \u201cpH\u201d is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in the esophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per- sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has been designed to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu- ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their daily routine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in their activities they occurred. During this period, a thin tube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to record changes. After the study, a computer is used to compare changes in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient. Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of many patients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge the effects of drug therapy. X-ray tests These fall into two categories: (1) those done with the use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per- formed with radioactive materials. Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest value in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph- agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal function test, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnostic possibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated with barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction. During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the passage of material through the esophagus in real time, and video recordings can also be done. This is particularly useful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com- mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke, although other diseases of the neuromuscular system (like myasthenia gravis) can produce the same symptoms. Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are use- ful because they are able not only to demonstrate that food passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor- mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow- ing food coated with material that is followed by a nuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when other methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it is necessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. As of 1997, scans mainly served as research tools. Preparation Patients should not eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Many medications affect the esopha- gus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or even stopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of all medications taken, including over-the-counter medica- tions (purchased without a doctor\u2019s prescription), and any known allergies. Aftercare For most of these studies, no special care is needed after the procedure. Patients can often go about normal daily activities following any of these tests. One excep- tion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the use of barium. This can have a constipating effect and patients should ask about using a mild laxative later on.

Prolonged snorting, for exam- ple, can irritate the nasal septum, producing nosebleeds, chronic runny nose, and other problems. Intravenous users face an increased risk of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Testing Drug testing can be useful in diagnosing and treating cocaine abuse. Urine testing can detect cocaine; besides providing an objective alternative to reliance on what a patient says, such tests can also be used as a follow-up to treatment to confirm that the patient has remained drug-free. Treatment The last two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment. But like all forms of drug abuse, cocaine abuse/addiction is a multi- faceted phenomenon involving environmental, social, and familial as well as physiological factors. This greatly complicates the challenge of effectively treating cocaine addiction. Pharmacological treatments To date, no medications have been approved specifi- cally for treating cocaine addiction. But several were under development at this writing. Selegeline, delivered either via a time-release pill or a transdermal patch, shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication. Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (also used to treat alcoholics) to be effective in treating cocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant medications are sometimes used to control the mood swings associat- ed with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal. Behavioral approaches A wide range of behavioral interventions have been successfully used to treat cocaine addiction. The approach used must be tailored to the specific needs of each individual patient, however. Contingency management rewards drug abstinence (confirmed by urine testing) with points or vouchers which patients can exchange for such things as an evening out or membership in a gym. Cognitive-behav- ioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and avoid situations most likely to lead to cocaine use and to devel- op healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Resi- dential programs/therapeutic communities may also be helpful, particularly in more severe cases. Patients typi- cally spend six to 12 months in such programs, which may also include vocational training and other features. KEY TERMS Apoxia\u2014Apoxia refers to altitude sickness.

Neurotransmitter \u2014A chemical that carries nerve impulses across a synapse. Synapse\u2014The gap between two nerve cells. Alternative treatment Various alternative or complementary approaches have been used in treating cocaine addiction, often in combination with more conventional therapies. In Japan, the herb acorus has been traditionally used both to assist early-stage cocaine withdrawal and in later recovery stages. Other herbs sometimes used to treat drug addic- tions of various kinds include kola nut, guarana seed and yohimbe (to boost short-term energy), and valerian root, hops leaf, scullcap leaf, and chamomile (to calm the patient). The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine have been used to reduce cocaine addicts\u2019 craving for the drug, and vitamin therapy may be used to help strengthen the patient. Gentle massage has been used to help infants born with congenital cocaine addiction. Other tech- niques, such as acupuncture , EEG biofeedback , and visualization, may also be useful in treating addiction. Prognosis Because addiction involves so many different factors, prospects for individual addicts vary widely. However, research has consistently shown that treatment can signifi- cantly reduce both drug abuse and subsequent criminal activity. The comprehensive Services Research Outcomes Study (1998) found a 45% drop in cocaine use five years after treatment, compared to use during the five years before treatment. The study also found that females generally respond better to treatment than males, and older patients tend to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.

Peter Gregutt Coccidioidomycosis Definition Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhal- ing the microscopic spores of the fungus Coccidioides immitis. Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that fungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists in three forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms. The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years after initial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed, injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi- nated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid- ioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affecting many organ systems and is often fatal. Description Coccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The fungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desert soil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen- tral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some- times called San Joaquin fever, valley fever, or desert fever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys of California. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid- ioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occur in only one out of every 100,000 people. Although anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm laborers, construction workers, and archaeologists who work where it is dusty are at greater risk to become infected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis, but the disease most commonly occurs in the 25\u201355 age group. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects men and women equally. Chronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy- cosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women. Although it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20 times more likely to develop the disseminated form of the disease than caucasians. People who have a weak- ened immune system (immunocompromised), either from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of medications that suppressed the immune system ( cor- ticosteroids, chemotherapy), are more likely to develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Causes and symptoms When the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they can become lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause localized inflammation. This is known as acute or primary coccid- ioidomycosis. The disease is not spread from one person to another. Approximately 60% of people who are infect- ed exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other 40%, symptoms appear 10\u201330 days after exposure. These symptoms include a fever which can reach 104\u00b0F (39.5\u00b0C), dry cough, chest pains, joint and muscle aches, headache , and weight loss. About two weeks after the start of the fever, some people develop a painful red rash or lumps on the lower legs. Symptoms usually disappear without treatment in about one month. People who have been infected gain partial immunity to reinfection. The chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally occurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years dur- ing which the patient experiences no symptoms of the disease.

          "content": "As many as three to four million people are estimat- ed to be chronic cocaine users. The 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported an estimated 600,000 current crack users, showing no significant change since the late 1980s. How cocaine affects the brain Extensive research has been conducted to determine how cocaine works on the brain and why it is so addictive. Cocaine has been found to affect an area of the brain known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which con- nects with the nucleus accumbens, a major pleasure cen- ter. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs, cocaine\u2019s effects are related to the action of the neuro- transmitter dopamine, which carries information between neurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioning of neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, which builds up in the synapses and is believed to cause the pleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users. Short-term effects of use The short-term effects of cocaine can include: \u2022 rapid heartbeat \u2022 constricted blood vessels \u2022 dilated pupils \u2022 increased temperature \u2022 increased energy \u2022 reduced appetite \u2022 increased sense of alertness \u2022 euphoria \u2022 death due to overdose Long-term effects of use The long-term effects of cocaine and crack use include: \u2022 dependence, addiction \u2022 irritability \u2022 mood swings \u2022 restlessness \u2022 weight loss \u2022 auditory hallucinations \u2022 paranoia Cocaine use and pregnancy The rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of crack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about its effects on the developing fetus and, since then, several research reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine use could be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn, and child development problems. According to the The Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many of these early reports had methodological flaws, and most researchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu- sions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi- dence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatal care and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac- tors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaine users. Research sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen- ter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatal care is associated with undesirable effects often attrib- uted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) however, reports that mothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five times as likely to have a baby with a malformation of the urinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus, cocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis- able, especially since it is also often associated with the use of alcohol known to cause long-term developmental problems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expecting mother so as to discourage cocaine use remains an important task for all health caregivers. Diagnosis Diagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult. Many of the signs of short-term cocaine use are not obvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs, it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drug from another. Cocaine use has been documented in significant numbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over all age groups, more men than women use the drug. The highest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to 25 years old.

Now classified as a Schedule II drug, cocaine has legitimate medical uses as well as a long history of recre- ational abuse. Administered by a licensed physician, the drug can be used as a local anesthetic for certain eye and ear problems and in some kinds of surgery. Forms of the drug In powder form, cocaine is known by such street names as \u201ccoke,\u201d \u201cblow,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cflake,\u201d \u201csnow\u201d and KEY TERMS Dyspnea\u2014Difficulty in breathing. Usually associ- ated with heart or lung diseases.

Crack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces an immediate and more intense high. It comes in off- white chunks or chips called \u201crocks.\u201d Little crumbs of crack are sometimes called \u201ckibbles & bits.\u201d In addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine and crack are often mixed with other substances. Cocaine may be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug of abuse, known as \u201ccat,\u201d that is similar to methampheta- mine) to create a \u201cwildcat.\u201d A hollowed-out cigar filled with a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a \u201cwoolah.\u201d And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc- tion with heroin is called a \u201cspeedball.\u201d Cocaine used together with alcohol represents the most common fatal two-drug combination. History Cocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive drugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used by the Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region of South America for thousands of years, both as a stimu- lant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia ( altitude sickness). Despite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not until the latter part of the nineteenth century that the active ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, was first extracted from those leaves. The new drug soon became a common ingredient in patent medicines and other popular products (including the original formula for Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con- cerns about the drug\u2019s negative effects. In the early 1900s, several legislative steps were taken to address those concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the use of cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod- ucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declined substantially. The drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed interest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s, use of the drug had once again become a national prob- lem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early 1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on the increase in certain geographic areas and among certain age groups. Causes and symptoms As with other forms of addiction , cocaine abuse is the result of a complex combination of internal and external factors. Genetic predisposition, family history, and immediate environment can all affect a person\u2019s probability of becoming addicted. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 831 Cocaine",

Penicillamine, a drug that increases the solubility of cystine, may be prescribed for patients who do not respond well to other therapies. This drug must be used with caution, however, because it can cause serious side effects or allergic reactions. For those unable to take penicillamine, another drug, alpha-mercaptopropionyl- glycine (Thiola), may be prescribed. Surgical treatments Most stones can be removed from the body by nor- mal urination, helped by drinking large amounts of water. Large stones that cannot be passed this way must be removed by surgical procedures. Large stones can be surgically removed by having a device called a uretoscope placed into the urethra, up through the bladder and into the ureter, where the trapped stone can be seen and removed. Another method involves using sound-wave energy aimed from outside the body to break the large stone into small pieces that can be passed by urination. This external technique is called extracor- poreal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). For large stones in the kidney, a procedure called per- cutaneous nephrolithomy may be used. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision in the back over the kidney. An instrument called a nephroscope is inserted through the incision into the kidney. The surgeon uses the nephroscope to locate and remove the stone. If the stone is very large, it may be broken up into smaller pieces by an ultrasonic or other kind of probe before removal. Prognosis As many as 50% of patients who have had surgical treatment for a kidney stone will have another stone within five years if no medicines are used to treat this condition.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Drug overdose Definition A drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine in an amount that is higher than is normally used. Description All drugs have the potential to be misused, whether legally prescribed by a doctor, purchased over-the- counter at the local drug store, or bought illegally on the street. Taken in combination with other drugs or with alcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can cause death or serious long term consequences. Children are particularly at risk for accidental overdose, accounting for over one million poisonings each year from drugs, alcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo- ple who suffer from depression and who have suicidal thoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose. Causes and symptoms Accidental drug overdose may be the result of mis- use of prescription medicines or commonly used medica- tions like pain relievers and cold remedies. Symptoms differ depending on the drug taken. Some of the drugs commonly involved in overdoses are listed below along with symptoms and outcomes. Acetaminophen is the generic name for the com- monly used pain reliever Tylenol. Overdose of this drug causes liver damage with symptoms that include loss of appetite, tiredness, nausea and vomiting , paleness, and sweating. The next stage of symptoms indicates liver failure and includes abdominal pain and tenderness, swelling of the liver, and abnormal blood tests for liver enzymes. In the last stage of this poisoning, liver failure advances and the patient becomes jaundiced, with yel- lowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. They may also experience kidney failure, bleeding disorders, and encephalopathy (swelling of the brain). Anticholinergic drugs (drugs that block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) like atropine, scopo- lamine, belladonna, antihistamines , and antipsychotic agents cause the skin and moist tissues (like in the mouth and nose) to become dry and flushed. Dilated pupils, an inability to urinate, and mental disturbances are also symptoms. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, extremely high blood pressure, and coma. Antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi- pramine, and nortriptyline can cause irregular heart rate, vomiting, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizures. An overdose of antidepressants also causes symptoms similar to those seen with anticholinergic drug overdoses. Cholinergic drugs (drugs that stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system) like carbamate and pilocarpine cause nausea, diarrhea, increased secretion of body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, and urine), fatigue , and muscle weakness. Convulsions are possible. Death can occur due to respiratory failure and heart failure. Cocaine and crack cocaine overdoses cause seizures, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, paranoia, and other changes in behavior. Heart attack or stroke are serious risks within three days after cocaine overdose. Depressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs, sleeping pills) cause sleepiness, slowed or slurred speech, difficulty walking or standing, blurred vision, impaired ability to think, disorientation, and mood changes.

Individuals with this syndrome have unusual facial features, poor muscle tone(hypotonia), small head size (microcephaly), and mental retardation. A classic feature of the syndrome is the cat- like cry made by infants with this disorder. Description Dr. Jerome Lejeune first described cri du chat syn- drome in 1963. The syndrome is named for the cat-like cry made by infants with this genetic disorder. Cri du chat means \u201ccry of the cat\u201d in French. This unusual cry is caused by abnormal development of the larynx (organ in the throat responsible for voice production). Cri du chat syndrome is also called \u201c5p minus syndrome\u201d because it is caused by a deletion, or removal, of genetic material from chromosome 5. The deletion that causes cri du chat syndrome occurs on the short or \u201cp\u201d arm of chromosome 5. This deleted genetic material is vital for normal devel- opment. Absence of this material results in the features associated with cri du chat syndrome. A high-pitched mewing cry during infancy is a classic feature of cri du chat. Infants with cri du chat also typically have low birth weight, slow growth, a small head (micro- cephaly) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants with cri du chat may have congenital heart defects. Individuals with cri du chat syndrome have language difficulties, delayed motor skill development, and mental retardation. Behav- ioral problems may also develop as the child matures. It has been estimated that cri du chat syndrome occurs in one of every 50,000 live births. According to the 5p minus Society, approximately 50\u201360 children are born with cri du chat syndrome in the United States each year. It can occur in all races and in both sexes. Causes and symptoms Cri du chat is the result of a chromosome abnormali- ty\u2014a deleted piece of chromosomal material on chromo- some 5. In 90% of patients with cri du chat syndrome, the deletion is sporadic. This means that it happens ran- domly and is not hereditary. If a child has cri du chat due to a sporadic deletion, the chance the parents could have another child with cri du chat is 1%. In approximately 10% of patients with cri du chat, there is a hereditary chromosomal rearrangement that causes the deletion. If a parent has this rearrangement, the risk for them to have a child with cri du chat is greater than 1%. An abnormal larynx causes the unusual cat-like cry made by infants that is a hallmark feature of the syndrome. As children with cri du chat get older, the cat-like cry becomes less noticeable. This can make the diagnosis more difficult in older patients. In addition to the cat-like GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 954 Cri du chat syndrome",

The rise in organ dona- tion has increased this route of transmission; grafts of infected corneas and dura mater (the tissue covering the brain) have been shown to transmit CJD. Another source is hormones concentrated from the pituitary glands of cadavers, some of whom carried CJD, for use in people with growth hormone deficiencies. Iatrogenic infection from exposure to nerve-containing tissue rep- resents a small fraction of all cases. The incubation period between exposure to the infectious agent is very long and is estimated to be from less than 10 to more than 30 years. It remains unlikely, but not impossible, that blood from patients with CJD is infectious to oth- ers by transfusion. \u2022 Sporadic CJD represents at least 85% of all cases. Spo- radic cases have no identifiable source of infection. Death usually follows first symptoms within eight months. Animal forms and \u201cmad cow disease\u201d Six forms of spongiform encephalopathies are known to occur in other mammals: scrapie in sheep, rec- ognized for more than 200 years; chronic wasting disease in elk and mule deer in Wyoming and Colorado; trans- missible mink encephalopathy; exotic ungulate encephalopathy in some types of zoo animals; feline spongiform encephalopathy in domestic cats; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows. BSE was first recognized in Britain in 1986. Besides the spongiform changes in the brain, BSE causes demen- tia-like behavioral changes\u2014hence the name \u201cmad cow disease.\u201d BSE was thought to be an altered form of scrapie, transmitted to cows when they were fed sheep offal (slaughterhouse waste) as part of their feed, but it is now thought to be more likely to be a primary cattle dis- ease spread by contaminated feed. The use of slaughterhouse offal in animal feed has been common in many countries and has been practiced for at least 50 years. The trigger for the BSE epidemic in Great Britain seems to have come in the early 1980s, when the use of organic solvents for preparation of offal was altered there. It is possible that these solvents had been destroying the agent called a prion, thereby prevent- ing infection, and that the change in preparation proce- dure opened the way for the agent to \u201cjump species\u201d and cause BSE in cows that consumed scrapie-infected meal. The slaughter of infected (but not yet visibly sick) cows at the end of their useful farm lives, and the use of their carcasses for feed, spread the infection rapidly and wide- ly. For at least a year after BSE was first recognized in British herds, infected bovine remains continued to be incorporated into feed, spreading the disease still further. Although milk from infected cows has never been shown to pass the infectious agent, passage from infected moth- er to calf may have occurred through unknown means. Beginning in 1988, the British government took steps to stop the spread of BSE, banning the use of bovine offal in feed and other products and ordering the slaughter of infected cows. By then, the slow-acting agent had become epidemic in British herds. In 1992, it was diagnosed in over 25,000 animals (1% of the British herd). By mid-1997, the cumulative number of BSE cases in the United Kingdom had risen to more than 170,000. The feeding ban did stem the tide of the epidemic; however, the number of new cases each week fell from a peak of 1,000 in 1993 to less than 300 two years later. The export of British feed and beef to member coun- tries was banned by the European Union, but cases of BSE had developed in Europe by then as well; however, by mid-1997, only about 1,000 cases had been identified. In 1989, the United States banned import of British beef and began monitoring United States herds in 1990. To date, no BSE has been detected in the United States, and only one case has been reported in North America in a cow imported to Canada from Great Britain. V ariant CJD: The human equivalent of mad cow disease? From the beginning of the BSE epidemic, scientists and others in Britain feared that BSE might jump species again to infect humans who had consumed infected beef. This, however, had never occurred in scrapie from sheep, a disease known from hundreds of years. In 1996, the first report of this possibility occurred and this fear seemed to be realized with the first cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, termed nvCJD, now just vCJD. Its victims are much younger than the 60\u201365 year old average for CJD, and the time from symptom onset to death has averaged 12 months or more instead of eight. The disease appears to cause more psychiatric symptoms early on. EEG abnormalities characteristic of CJD are not typically seen in vCJD. As of July 2001, the total number of human cases of vCJD is 102. It is of major concern that the number of cases per year seems to be increasing by a factor of 1.35 each year. Almost all the cases have been found in Great Britain with three in France, one in Ireland, and one sus- pected in Hong Kong (who spent time in Great Britain).

Most doctors had never seen a case. With the recognition of a so-called \u201cnew variant\u201d or simply variant form of CJD with the strong possibility that those with it became infected simply by eating contaminated beef, CJD has become one of the most talked-about diseases in the world. Additionally, the radical theory that the infectious agent is a normal protein that has been changed in its form has also sparked much interest. First described in the first part of the twentieth cen- tury independently by Cretzfeldt and Jakob, CJD is a neurodegenerative disease causing a rapidly progressing dementia ending in death, usually within eight months of the onset of symptoms. It is also a very rare disease, affecting only about one in every million in the popula- tion through out the world. In the United States, CJD is thought to affect about 250 people each year. CJD affects adults primarily between ages 50 and 75. Spongiform encephalopathies The most obvious pathologic feature of CJD is the formation of numerous fluid-filled spaces in the brain (vacuoles) resulting in a sponge-like appearance. CJD is one of several human \u201cspongiform encephalopathies,\u201d diseases that produce this characteristic change in brain tissue. Others are kuru; Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, a genetic predominantly characterized by cere- bellar ataxia (a kind of movement disorder); and fatal familial insomnia, associated with progressive insomnia, autonomic system disfunction, and weakness caused by motor system dysfunction. Kuru was prevalent among the Fore people in Papua, New Guinea, and spread from infected individuals after their deaths through the practice of ritual cannibalism, in which the relatives of the dead person honored him by consuming his organs, including the brain. Discovery of the infectious nature of kuru won the Nobel Prize for Carleton Gadjusek in 1976. The incubation period for kuru was between four to 30 years or more. While kuru has virtually disappeared following the cessation of these cannibalistic practices, several new cases continue to arise each year. Cases of CJD have been grouped into three types: familial, iatrogenic, and sporadic. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 950 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease",

          "content": "Colic Definition Colic is persistent, unexplained crying in a healthy baby between two weeks and five months of age. Description Colic, which is not a disease, affects 10\u201320% of all infants. It is more common in boys than in girls and most common in a family\u2019s first child. Symptoms of colic usu- ally appear when a baby is 14\u201321 days old, reach a crescendo at the age of three months, and disappear with- in the next eight weeks. Episodes occur frequently but intermittently and usually begin with prolonged periods of crying in the late afternoon or evening. They can last for just a few minutes or continue for several hours. Some babies who have colic are simply fussy. Others cry so hard that their faces turn red, then pale. Causes and symptoms No one knows what causes colic. The condition may be the result of swallowing large amounts of air, which becomes trapped in the digestive tract and causes bloat- ing and severe abdominal pain. Other possible causes of colic include: \u2022 digestive tract immaturity \u2022 food intolerances \u2022 hunger or overfeeding \u2022 lack of sleep \u2022 loneliness \u2022 overheated milk or formula \u2022 overstimulation resulting from noise, light, or activity \u2022 tension During a colicky episode, babies\u2019 bellies often look swollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound. Crying intensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many babies grow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and draw their legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel move- ment can end an attack. Most babies who have colic don\u2019t seem to be in pain between attacks. Diagnosis Pediatricians and family physicians suspect colic in an infant who: \u2022 has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least three times a week for three weeks or longer \u2022 is not hungry but cries for several hours between din- nertime and midnight \u2022 demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other physical traits associated with colic The baby\u2019s medical history and a parent\u2019s descrip- tion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used to confirm a diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and laboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinal blockage, and other conditions that can cause abdominal pain and other colic-like symptoms. Treatment Medications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes recommend simethicone (Mylicon Drops) to relieve gas pain, but generally advise parents to take a practical approach to the problem. Gently massaging the baby\u2019s back can release a trapped gas bubble, and holding the baby in a sitting position can help prevent air from being swallowed dur- ing feedings. Bottle-fed babies can swallow air if nipple holes are either too large or too small. Nipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle with cold formula, turning it upside down, and counting the number of drops released when it is shaken or squeezed. A nipple hole that is the right size will release about one drop of formula every second. Babies should not be fed every time they cry, but feeding and burping a baby more often may alleviate symptoms of colic. A bottle-fed baby should be burped after every ounce, and a baby who is breastfeeding should be burped every five minutes. When cow\u2019s milk is the source of the symptoms, bottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy milk hydrolyzed protein formula. A woman whose baby is breastfeeding should eliminate dairy products from her diet for seven days, then gradually reintroduce them unless the baby\u2019s symptoms reappear. Since intolerance to foods other than cow\u2019s milk may also lead to symptoms of colic, breastfeeding women may also relieve their babies\u2019 colic by eliminating from their diet: \u2022 coffee \u2022 tea \u2022 cocoa \u2022 citrus \u2022 peanuts \u2022 wheat \u2022 broccoli and other vegetables belonging to the cabbage family GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 847 Colic",

          "content": "about 30 minutes to two hours after eating or drinking foods containing lactose. Food intolerances can be con- fused with food allergies, since the symptoms of nausea, cramps, bloating, and diarrhea are similar. Sugars that aren\u2019t broken down into one of the sim- plest forms cause the body to push fluid into the intestines, which results in watery diarrhea (osmotic diarrhea). Diar- rhea may sweep other nutrients out of the intestine before they can be absorbed, causing malnutrition. Diagnosis Carbohydrate intolerance can be diagnosed using oral tolerance tests. The carbohydrate being investigated is given by mouth in liquid form and several blood levels are measured and compared to normal values. This helps evaluate the individual\u2019s ability to digest the sugar. To identify lactose intolerance in children and adults, the hydrogen breath test is used to measure the amount of hydrogen in the breath. The patient drinks a beverage containing lactose and the breath is analyzed at regular intervals. If undigested lactose in the large intestine (colon) is fermented by bacteria, various gases are produced. Hydrogen is absorbed from the intestines KEY TERMS Celiac disease\u2014A disease, occurring in both chil- dren and adults, which is caused by a sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in grains.

Enzyme\u2014A substance produced by the body to assist in a chemical reaction.

Normally there is very little hydrogen detectable in the breath, so its presence indicates faulty digestion of lactose. When lactose intolerance is suspected in infants and young children, many pediatricians recommend simply changing from cow\u2019s milk to soy formula and watching for improvement. If needed, a stool sample can be tested for acidity. The inadequate digestion of lactose will result in an increase of acid in the waste matter excreted by the bowels and the presence of glucose. Treatment Carbohydrate intolerance caused by temporary intestinal diseases disappears when the condition is suc- cessfully treated. In primary conditions, no treatment exists to improve the body\u2019s ability to produce the enzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet. Because the degree of lactose intolerance varies so much, treatment should be tailored for the individual. Young children showing signs of intolerance should avoid milk products; infants should switch to soy-based formula. Older children and adults can adjust their intake of lactose depending on how much and what they can tolerate. For some, a small glass of milk will not cause problems, while others may be able to handle ice cream or aged cheeses such as cheddar or Swiss, but not other dairy products. Generally, small amounts of lactose-con- taining foods taken throughout the day are better tolerat- ed than a large amount consumed all at once. For those individuals who are sensitive to even very small amounts of lactose, the lactase enzyme is available without a prescription. It comes in liquid form for use with milk. The addition of a few drops to a quart of milk will reduce the lactose content by 70% after 24 hours in the refrigerator. Heating the milk speeds up the process, and doubling the amount of lactase liquid will result in milk that is 90% lactose free. Chewable lactase enzyme tablets are also available. Three to six tablets taken before a meal or snack will aid in the digestion of solid foods. Lactose-reduced milk and other products are also available in stores. The milk contains the same nutrients as regular milk. Because dairy products are an important source of calcium, people who reduce or severely limit their intake of dairy products may need to consider other ways to consume an adequate amount of calcium in their diets. Prognosis With good dietary management, individuals with carbohydrate intolerance can lead normal lives. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 650 Carbohydrate intolerance",

Further uses have shown positive results in the treatment of a wide range of chronic conditions such as arteriosclerosis, congenital defects, and sexual dysfunction . The therapy has also been used to treat cancer patients at a number of clinics in Tijuana, Mexico, although this application has not been well supported with controlled clinical studies. Description Origins The theory behind cell therapy has been in existence for several hundred years. The first recorded discussion of the concept of cell therapy can be traced to Phillippus Aureolus Paracelsus (1493\u20131541), a German-Swiss physi- cian and alchemist who wrote in his Der grossen Wun- dartzney (\u201cGreat Surgery Book\u201d) in 1536 that \u201cthe heart heals the heart, lung heals the lung, spleen heals the spleen; like cures like.\u201d Paracelsus and many of his contemporaries agreed that the best way to treat an illness was to use living tissue to restore the ailing. In 1667, at a laboratory in the palace of Louis XIV , Jean-Baptiste Denis (1640\u20131704) attempted to transfuse blood from a calf into a mentally ill patient\u2014and since blood transfusion is, in effect, a form of cell therapy, this could be the first documented case of this procedure. However, the first recorded attempt at non- blood cellular therapy occurred in 1912 when German physicians attempted to treat children with hypothy- roidism, or an underactive thyroid, with thyroid cells. In 1931, Dr. Paul Niehans (1882\u20131971), a Swiss physician, became known as \u201cthe father of cell therapy\u201d quite by chance. After a surgical accident by a colleague, Niehans attempted to transplant a patient\u2019s severely dam- aged parathyroid glands with those of a steer. When the patient began to rapidly deteriorate before the transplant could take place, Niehans decided to dice the steer\u2019s parathyroid gland into fine pieces, mix the pieces in a saline solution, and inject them into the dying patient. Immediately, the patient began to improve and, in fact, lived for another 30 years. Cell therapy is, in effect, a type of organ transplant which has also been referred to as \u201clive cell therapy,\u201d \u201cxenotransplant therapy,\u201d \u201ccellular suspensions,\u201d \u201cglan- dular therapy,\u201d or \u201cfresh cell therapy.\u201d The procedure involves the injection of either whole fetal xenogenic (animal) cells (e.g., from sheep, cows, pigs, and sharks) or cell extracts from human tissue. The latter is known as autologous cell therapy if the cells are extracted from and transplanted back into the same patient. Several different types of cells can be administered simultaneously. Just as Paracelsus\u2019 theory of \u201clike cures like,\u201d the types of cells that are administered correspond in some GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 686 Cell therapy",

          "content": "Precautions Patients undergoing cell therapy treatments which use cells transplanted from animals or other humans run the risk of cell rejection, in which the body recognizes the cells as a foreign substance and uses the immune sys- tem\u2019s T-cells to attack and destroy them. Some forms of cell therapy use special coatings on the cells designed to trick the immune system into recognizing the new cells as native to the body. There is also the chance of the cell solution transmit- ting bacterial or viral infection or other disease and para- sites to the patient. Careful screening and testing of cells for pathogens can reduce this risk. Many forms of cell therapy in the United States are still largely experimental procedures. Patients should approach these treatments with extreme caution, should inquire about their proven efficacy and legal use in the United States, and should only accept treatment from a licensed physician who should educate the patient com- pletely on the risks and possible side effects involved with cell therapy. These same cautions apply for patients interested in participating in clinical trials of cell therapy treatments. Side effects Because cell therapy encompasses such a wide range of treatments and applications, and many of these treat- ments are still experimental, the full range of possible side effects of the treatments are not yet known. Anaphy- lactic shock (severe allergic reaction), immune system reactions, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) are just a few of the known reported side effects in some patients to date. Side effects of the FDA-approved chondrocyte cell therapy used in knee joint repair may include tissue hypertrophy, a condition where too much cartilage grows in the joint where the cells were transplanted to and the knee joint begins to stiffen.

Culturing \u2014To grow cells in a special substance, or media, in the laboratory. Encephalitis\u2014Inflammation of the brain. Research and general acceptance There is a growing debate in the medical community over the efficacy and ethical implications of cell therapy. Much of the ethical debate revolves around the use of human fetal stem cells in treatment, and the fact that these cells must be harvested from aborted fetuses. While some cell therapy procedures have had proven success in clinical studies, others are still largely unproven, including cell therapy for cancer treatment. Until more large, controlled clinical studies are per- formed on these procedures to either prove or disprove their efficacy, they will remain fringe treatments.

Laith Farid Gulli, M.D. Nicole Mallory, M.S. Cancer therapy, palliative Definition Palliative cancer therapy is treatment specifically directed to help improve the symptoms associated with terminal cancer. Purpose Palliative care is directed to improving symptoms associated with incurable cancer. Care can include surgery, radiation therapy , chemotherapy , sympto- matic treatments resulting from cancer, and side effects of treatment. The primary objective of palliative care is to improve the quality of remaining duration of life. Treatment usually involves a combination of modalities (multimodality approach) and numerous specialists are typically involved in the treatment planning process. Therapeutic planning usually involves meticulous coor- dination with the treatment team. Surgery can be utilized for palliation after careful evaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these cases may reduce the tumor bulk and help improve the quality of life by relieving pain, alleviating obstruction, or control- ling bleeding. Radiotherapy for terminal cancer patients can also alleviate pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neigh- boring areas. Chemotherapy may be helpful to reduce tumor size and provide some reduction to metastatic dis- ease. Long-term chemotherapy patients develop drug resistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treat- ments ineffective. If this occurs patients are usually given a second line medication or, if admission criteria are met, they may participate in an experimental research protocol. Palliative treatments and terminal cancer in combination can cause many symptoms that can become problematic. These symptoms commonly include pain, nausea, vomit- ing, difficulty in breathing, constipation, dehydration, agitation, and delirium. The palliative treatment-planning goal focuses to reduce these symptoms. Precautions Surgery for the purpose of tumor removal, biopsy, or size reduction is associated with postoperative pain and local nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficult to alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can also produce nerve damage and severe pain. Additionally, patients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infections like herpes, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound abscess, all of which can cause severe pain. Pain associated with cancer and/or treatments can significantly impair the patient\u2019s capabilities for performing daily tasks and hence impair quality of life. These complications may negatively impact the patient\u2019s psychological well being. Description Pain is one of the common symptoms associated with cancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer patients have pain. Pain is a subjective symptom and thus it cannot be measured using technological approaches. Pain can be assessed using numeric scales (from one to 10, one is rated as no pain while 10 is severe) or rating specific facial expressions associated with various levels of pain. The majority of cancer patients experience pain as a result of tumor mass that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, or soft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain). Pain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles, and internal structures such as the abdomen (cramping type pain associated with obstruction). Many patients also experience various types of pain as a direct result of fol- low-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo- therapy) and diagnostic procedures (i.e., biopsy). Preparation Patients are typically informed that their diagnosis is terminal and treatments are directed to improve quality of life for the remaining time and to minimize emotional suffering associated with pain.

Cancer chemotherapy drugs see Anticancer drugs Cancer therapy, definitive Definition Definitive cancer therapy is a treatment plan designed to potentially cure cancer using one or a combi- nation of interventions including surgery, radiation, chemical agents, or biological therapies. Purpose The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells from the infected person. Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies poten- tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera- tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers. The best chance for a surgical cure is usually with the first opera- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2638 Cancer therapy, definitive",

The possible outcomes of chemotherapy are: \u2022 Complete remission or response. The cancer complete- ly disappears. The course of chemotherapy is complet- ed and the patient is tested regularly for a recurrence. \u2022 Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in size but does not disappear.

Purpose Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection. Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer- gency or a planned procedure. Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity is also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some- times called thoracostomy tube drainage. Conditions that may need to be treated by chest drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues of the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu- mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions include cancer that causes excessive secretions, empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax (blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage therapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavity after lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung is collapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapy allows the lung to reinflate. Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 743 Chest drainage therapy",

Maureen Haggerty Delavirdine see Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Delayed hypersensitivity skin test Definition A delayed hypersensitivity test (DHT) is an immune function test measuring the presence of activated T cells that recognize a certain substance. Purpose The immune system protects against infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial expo- sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys- tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Both these immune agents respond when the body is reex- posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulating proteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termed an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells\u2019 respons- es occur over several days, and are thus called delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat- ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red- ness (erythema) at the injection site. A DHT is performed for one of three reasons: \u2022 To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber- culosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting into the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con- tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provoke an immune response. \u2022 To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants, such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually done by placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con- taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub- stances. \u2022 To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of the evaluation of immune system health in infection, cancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen- ing, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict survival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu- ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens used for these tests must be ones the patient has been exposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivated antigens from common infectious agents to which the patient might have been exposed, such as mumps , Candida albicans , tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a skin fungus). Precautions No special precautions are necessary for most patients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certain skin irritants should alert the clinician performing the test. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigens contain mercury, a source of irritation to some patients. Description The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in which a small amount of TB antigen is injected into the skin. The area is examined 48\u201372 hours after the injection. In the patch test, 20\u201330 adhesive patches are usually placed on the upper back. The patches are kept in place and the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches are then removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after- ward, and possibly again a day or more following that. Patch testing is usually performed following a patient complaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance. Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying the right one requires careful review of the patient\u2019s possi- ble exposure. The test of overall T cell responsiveness is per- formed with several injections. Each area injected is cir- cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the injection. Preparation No special preparation is necessary. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1019 Delayed hypersensitivity skin test",

Frey Cold sensitivity antibodies test see Cryoglobulin test Cold sore Definition A cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually appears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus infection. Description A cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is usually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold sore are fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi- alis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur on the lips which distinguishes them from the common canker sore, which is usually inside the mouth. Cold sores do not usually occur inside the mouth except dur- ing the initial episode. Canker sores usually form either on the tongue or inside the cheeks. Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are eight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only two of these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause cold sores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virus type 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virus type 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely true. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her- pes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent cold sores are almost always type 1. Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of Americans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% of those infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most of these persons became infected before age 10. Anyone can become infected by herpes virus and, once infected, the virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses are spread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin con- tact. The highest risk for spreading the virus is the time period beginning with the appearance of blisters and end- ing with scab formation. However, infected persons need not have visible blisters to spread the infection to others since the virus may be present in the saliva without obvi- ous oral lesions. Viruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria are independent and can reproduce on their own, viruses enter human cells and force them to make more virus. The infected human cell is usually killed and releases thou- sands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tissue damage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, the her- pes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cell produce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits. The herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This is called \u201clatency.\u201d A latent virus can wait inside the nervous system for days, months, or even years. At some future time, the virus \u201cawakens\u201d and causes the cell to produce thousands of new viruses that cause an active infection. This process of latency and active infection is best understood by considering the cold sore cycle. An active infection is obvious because cold sores are present. The first infection is called the \u201cprimary\u201d infection. This active infection is then controlled by the body\u2019s immune system and the sores heal. In between active infections, the virus is latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses become activated and once again cause sores. These are called \u201crecurrent\u201d infections. Although it is unknown what trig- gers latent virus to activate, several conditions seem to bring on infections. These include stress, illness, tired- ness, exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet. Causes and symptoms While anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not everyone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of herpes occur within two-20 days after contact with an infected person. Symptoms of the primary infection are usually more severe than those of recurrent infections. The primary infection can cause symptoms like other viral infections including tiredness, headache, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Typically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe- rience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of pain, burning, itching, or tingling at the site where blis- ters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywhere from a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec- tion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection and recurrent infections. In 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters occur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the \u201cvermilion border.\u201d Less often, blisters form on the nose, chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the disease process is rapid. First, small red bumps appear that quickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters may either burst and form a scab or dry up and form a scab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis- ters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely and without scarring within six to ten days. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 844 Cold sore",

          "content": "Failure to thrive may also result from lack of avail- able food or the quality of the food offered. This can be due to economic factors in the family, parental beliefs and concepts of nutrition, or neglect of the child. In addition, if the baby is being breast fed, the quality or quantity of the mother\u2019s milk may be the source of the problem. Psychosocial problems, often stemming from a lack of nurturing parent-child relations can lead to a failure to thrive. The child may exhibit poor appetite due to depres- sion from insufficient attention from parents. Infants and toddlers, whose growth is substantially less than expected, are considered to be suffering from FTT. Diagnosis Most babies are weighed at birth and that weight is used as a base line for future well-baby check-ups. If the baby is not gaining weight at a predictable rate, the doc- tor will do a more extensive examination. If there are no apparent physical deformities in the digestive tract, the doctor will examine the child\u2019s environment. As part of that examination, the doctor will look at the family histo- ry of height and weight. In addition, the parents will be asked about feedings, illnesses, and family routines. If the mother is breastfeeding the doctor will also evaluate her diet, general health, and well being as it affects the quantity and quality of her milk. Diagnosis of FTT is confirmed by a positive growth and behavioral response to increased nutrition. Treatment If there is an underlying physical reason for failure to thrive, such as a disorder of swallowing mechanism or intestinal problems, correcting that problem should reverse the condition. If the condition is caused by envi- ronmental factors, the physician will suggest several ways parents may provide adequate food for the child. Maternal education and parental counseling may also be recommended. In extreme cases, hospitalization or a more nurturing home may be necessary. Prognosis The first year of life is important as a foundation for growth and physical and intellectual development in the future. Children with extreme failure to thrive in the first year may never catch up to their peers even if their physi- cal growth improves. In about one third of these extreme cases, mental development remains below normal and roughly half will continue to have psychosocial and eat- ing problems throughout life. KEY TERMS Esophagus \u2014The muscular tube which connects the mouth and stomach. Psychosocial\u2014A term referring to the mind\u2019s abili- ty to, consciously or unconsciously, adjust and relate the body to its social environment. When failure to thrive is identified and corrected early, most children catch up to their peers and remain healthy and well developed. Prevention Initial failure to thrive caused by physical defects cannot be prevented but can often be corrected before they become a danger to the child. Maternal education and emotional and economic support systems all help to prevent failure to thrive in those cases where there is no physical deformity.

          "content": "Emotional and social health Children take their first significant steps toward socialization and peer interaction when they begin to engage in cooperative play at around age four. Their social development will progress throughout childhood and adolescence as they develop friendships, start to be influenced by their peers, and begin to show interest in the opposite sex. Factors which can have a negative impact on the emotional and social well-being of children include: \u2022 Violence. Bullying can cause serious damage to a child\u2019s sense of self-esteem and personal safety, as can experiences with school violence. \u2022 Family turmoil. Divorce, death, and other life-chang- ing events that alter the family dynamic can have a seri- ous impact on a child. Even a positive event such as the birth of a sibling or a move to a new city and school can put emotional strain on a child. \u2022 Stress. The pressure to perform well academically and in extracurricular activities such as sports can be over- whelming to some children. \u2022 Peer pressure. Although it can have a positive impact, peer pressure is often a source of significant stress for children. This is particularly true in adolescence when \u201cfitting in\u201d seems all-important. \u2022 Drugs and alcohol. Curiosity is intrinsic to childhood, and over 30% of children have experimented with alco- hol by age 13. Open communication with children that sets forth parental expectations about drug and alcohol use is essential. \u2022 Negative sexual experiences. Sexual abuse and assault can emotionally scar a child and instill negative feel- ings about sexuality and relationships. Causes and symptoms Childhood health problems may be congenital (i.e., present at birth) or acquired through infection, immune system deficiency, or another disease process. They may also be caused by physical trauma (e.g., a car accident or a playground fall) or a toxic substance (e.g., an allergen, drug, or poisonous chemical), or triggered by genetic or environmental factors. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 763 Children\u2019s health DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK (1903\u20131998) Benjamin Spock, pediatrician and political activist, was most noted for his authorship of Baby and Child Care, which significantly changed predominant attitudes toward the raising of infants and children. He began med- ical school at Yale University in 1925, and transferred to Columbia University\u2019s College of Physicians and Sur- geons in 1927. Spock had decided well before starting his medical studies that he would \u201cwork with children, who have their whole lives ahead of them\u201d and so, upon tak- ing his M.D. degree in 1929 and serving his general internship at the prestigious Presbyterian Hospital, he specialized in pediatrics at a small hospital crowded with children in New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen area. On a summer vacation in 1943 he began to write his most famous book and he continued to work on it from 1944 to 1946 while serving as a medical officer in the Navy. The book sharply broke with the authoritarian tone and rigorous instructions found in earlier generations of baby-care books, most of which said to feed infants on a strict schedule and not to pick them up when they cried. Spock, who spent ten years trying to reconcile his psycho- analytic training with what mothers were telling him about their children, told his readers \u201cY ou know more than you think you do. Don\u2019t be afraid to trust your own common sense. Take it easy, trust your own instincts, and follow the directions that your doctor gives you.\u201d The response was overwhelming. Baby and Child Care rapidly became America\u2019s all-time best-seller except for Shakespeare and the Bible; by 1976 it had also eclipsed Shakespeare. (Library of Congress.)",

In some cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of records from other hospitals. Treatment Treatment of factitious disorders is usually limited to prompt recognition of the condition and the refusal to give unnecessary medications or to perform unneeded procedures. Factitious disorder patients do not usually remain in the hospital long enough for effective psychi- atric treatment. Some clinicians have tried psychothera- peutic treatment for factitious disorder patients, and there are anecdotal reports that antidepressant or antipsychotic medications are helpful in certain cases. Prognosis Some patients have only one or two episodes of fac- titious disorders; others develop a chronic form that may be lifelong. Successful treatment of the chronic form appears to be rare.

Frey Factor IX deficiency see Hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency see Hemophilia Failure to thrive Definition Failure to thrive (FTT) is used to describe a delay in a child\u2019s growth or development. It is usually applied to infants and children up to two years of age who do not gain or maintain weight as they should. Failure to thrive is not a specific disease, but rather a cluster of symptoms which may come from a variety of sources. Description Shortly after birth most infants loose some weight. After that expected loss, babies should gain weight at a steady and predictable rate. When a baby does not gain weigh as expected, or continues to loose weight, it is not thriving. Failure to thrive may be due to one or more conditions. Organic failure to thrive (OFTT) implies that the organs involved with digestion and absorption of food are malformed or incomplete so the baby cannot digest its food. Non-organic failure to thrive (NOFTT) is the most common cause of FTT and implies the baby is not receiving enough food due to economic factors or parental neglect, or do to psychosocial problems. Causes and symptoms Occasionally, there may be an underlying physical condition that inhibits the baby\u2019s ability to take in, digest, or process food. These defects can occur in the esopha- gus, stomach, small or large intestine, rectum or anus. Usually the defect is an incomplete development of the organ, and it must be surgically corrected. Most physical defects can be detected shortly after birth. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21278 Failure to thrive",

When an infection occurs, fever-inducing agents called pyrogens are released, either by the body\u2019s immune system or by the invading cells themselves, that trigger the resetting of the thermostat. In other circumstances, the immune system may overreact (allergic reactions) or become damaged (autoimmune dis- eases), causing the uncontrolled release of pyrogens. A stroke or tumor can damage the hypothalamus, causing the body\u2019s thermostat to malfunction. Excessive exposure to the sun or intensely exercising in hot weather can result in heat stroke, a condition in which the body\u2019s cooling mechanisms fail. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare, inher- ited condition in which a person develops a very high fever when given certain anesthetics or muscle relaxants in preparation for surgery. How long a fever lasts and how high it may go depends on several factors, including its cause, the age of the patient, and his or her overall health. Most fevers caused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and then dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec- tious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fall throughout the day, reaching its peek in the late after- noon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts for several weeks is associated with autoimmune diseases such as lupus or with some cancers, particularly leukemia and lymphoma. Diagnosis A fever is usually diagnosed using a thermometer. A variety of different thermometers are available, including traditional glass and mercury ones used for oral or rectal temperature readings and more sophisticated electronic ones that can be inserted in the ear to quickly register the body\u2019s temperature. For adults and older children, temper- ature readings are usually taken orally. Younger children who cannot or will not hold a thermometer in their mouths can have their temperature taken by placing an oral ther- mometer under their armpit. Infants generally have their temperature taken rectally using a rectal thermometer. As important as registering a patient\u2019s temperature is determining the underlying cause of the fever. The pres- ence or absence of accompanying symptoms, a patient\u2019s medical history, and information about what he or she may have ingested, any recent trips taken, or possible exposures to illness help the physician make a diagnosis. Blood tests can aid in identifying an infectious agent by detecting the presence of antibodies against it or provid- ing samples for growth of the organism in a culture. Blood tests can also provide the doctor with white blood cell counts.

Treatment Physicians agree that the most effective treatment for a fever is to address its underlying cause, such as through the administration of antibiotics. Also, because a fever helps the immune system fight infection, it usual- ly should be allowed to run its course. Drugs to lower fever (antipyretics) can be given if a patient (particularly a child) is uncomfortable. These include aspirin, aceta- minophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofin (Advil). Aspirin, however, should not be given to a child or adolescent with a fever since this drug has been linked to an increased risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome.

Some hospitals and communities maintain child protection teams that respond to cases of possible abuse.

          "content": "Precautions Because the implants are controversial, very expen- sive, and have uncertain results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited the implants to people: \u2022 who get no significant benefit from hearing aids \u2022 who are at least 2 years old (the age at which specialists can verify severity of deafness) \u2022 with severe to profound hearing loss. Description Hearing loss is caused by a number of different problems that occur either in the hearing nerve or parts of the middle or inner ear. The most common type of deaf- ness is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea, the hearing part of the inner ear. Normally, hair cells stimu- late the hearing nerve, which transmits sound signals to the brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearing nerve remains unstimulated, and the person can\u2019t hear. Hair cells can be destroyed by many things, including infection, trauma, loud noise, aging, or birth defects. All cochlear implants consist of a microphone worn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends it along a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in a small shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processor boosts the sound, filters out background noise, and turns sound into digital signals before sending it to a transmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds the transmitter in place through its attraction to the receiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgical- ly attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiver picks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter, and converts them into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses flow through electrodes contained in a narrow, flexible tube that has been threaded into the cochlea. As many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type of implant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearing nerve. The brain then interprets the signals as specific sounds. Despite the benefits that the implant appears to offer, some hearing specialists and members of the deaf com- munity still believe that the benefits may not outweigh the risks and limitations of the device. Because the device must be surgically implanted, it carries some sur- gical risk. Also, manufacturers can\u2019t promise how well a person will hear with an implant. Moreover, after getting an implant, some people say they feel alienated from the Deaf community, while at the same time not feeling fully a part of the hearing world. The sounds heard through an implant are different from the normal hearing sounds, and have been described as artificial or \u201crobotlike.\u201d This is because the implant\u2019s handful of electrodes cannot hope to match the complexity of a person\u2019s 15,000 hair cells. Surgical procedure During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge on the skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. The surgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone, and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. This operation takes between one and one-half to five hours. Preparation Before a person gets an implant, specialists at an implant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, including extensive hearing tests to determine how well the candi- date can hear. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will benefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per- son becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf- ness, the better the person is likely to understand speech with an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearing nerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve. First, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful hear- ing aid. If the aid can\u2019t improve hearing enough, a physi- cian then performs a physical exam and orders a scan of the inner ear (some patients with a scarred cochlea aren\u2019t good candidates). A doctor may also order a psychological exam to better understand the person\u2019s expectations. Patients need to be highly motivated, and have a realistic understanding of what an implant can and cannot do. Aftercare The patient remains in the hospital for a day or two after the surgery.

A clini- cican tunes the speech processor and sets levels of stimu- lation for each electrode, from soft to loud. The patient is then trained in how to interpret the sounds heard through the device. The length of the train- ing varies from days to years, depending on how well the person can interpret the sounds heard through the device. Risks As with all operations, there are a few risks of surgery. These include: \u2022 dizziness \u2022 facial paralysis (rarely) \u2022 infection at the incision site Scientists aren\u2019t sure about the long-term effects of electrical stimulation on the nervous system. It is also possible to damage the implant\u2019s internal components by a blow to the head, which will render the device unworkable. Normal results Most profoundly, deaf patients who receive an implant are able to discern medium and loud sounds, including speech, at comfortable listening levels. Many use sound clues from the implant, together with speech reading and other facial cues. Almost all adults improve their communication skills when combining the implant with speech reading (lip reading), and some can under- stand spoken words without speech reading. More than half of adults who lost hearing after they learned to speak can understand some speech without speech reading. About 30% can understand spoken sounds well enough to use the phone. Children who were born deaf or who lost their hear- ing before they could speak have the most difficulty in learning to use the implant. Research suggests, however, that most of these children are able to learn spoken lan- guage and understand speech using the implant. Resources BOOKS Clark, Graeme M., Robert S. C.

Nonsurgical treatment of a cleft palate is available for patients who are at high risk for surgery and consists of a prosthetic appliance worn to block the opening in the palate. Babies born with cleft palates are vulnerable to ear infections. Their Eustachian tubes do not effectively drain fluid from the middle ear so fluid accumulates and infection sets in. This may lead to hearing loss. These children require drainage tubes to be inserted to prevent fluid accumulation. Babies born with clefts usually require orthodontic treatment between 13 and 18 years of age. They also require speech therapy.

CFIs are sometimes referred to as closed fist injuries or fight bites. Description Clenched fist injuries are most common over the metacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is deceptive because they do not bleed heavily and the underlying injury is hidden by soft tissue when the patient opens his hand and straightens the injured finger. CFIs can, however, have seri- ous consequences, including infection, cellulitis, inflam- mation of the bone or bone marrow (osteomyelitis), septic arthritis, and inflammation of the sheaths covering the ten- dons of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to perma- nent loss of function or amputation. Most CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force of impact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting from contact with the teeth, and contamination of the wound by the bacteria in human saliva. As the patient opens his hand, the skin of the finger is pulled backward over the deeper part of the wound, thus sealing bacteria within the injured tissue. This sealing of the wound by normal motions of the finger is the reason why clenched fist injuries have the highest rate of infection of any human bite. The rate of infection of clenched-fist injuries varies from 15\u201350%. Causes and symptoms The causes of CFIs include fighting and other forms of aggressive behavior, often combined with drug or alcohol consumption. The symptoms of clenched fist injury include pain in the affected part of the hand and some stiffness of the injured finger with limitation of movement. If the patient has delayed getting medical treatment, there may be evi- dence of infection, including swelling, redness, and sup- puration (a discharge of pus). The skin around the wound will be warm to the touch and fever may be present. Diagnosis Diagnosis of clenched fist injuries is usually made on the basis of the location of the injury and x-ray find- ings. The most common finding in CFI x rays is soft tis- sue swelling, but the x rays may also reveal air pockets in deep tissues or the joint spaces, fragments of teeth, frac- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2820 Clenched fist injury",

Treatment Treatment exists to either control the pain or elimi- nate the cause.

This is done through careful diagnosis and the applica- tion of manual treatments, corticosteroid injections into the coccyx vertebrae, or surgery. Injections into the fourth and fifth sacral nerves and coccygeal nerves often bring relief, but are considered more as a pain control measure than as curative treatment. Manual treatments have not been found to be effective. Surgery is a radical procedure whose indications are inconsistent and depen- dent on the subjectivity of the physician.

It is different from a hearing aid, which simply amplifies sound.

          "content": "and fluid are drained, and the wound is closed. Performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility under local or general anesthetic, full recovery takes about three weeks but hearing should improve immediately. Tympanoplasty Tympanoplasty is performed to reconstruct the eardrum after partial or total conductive hearing loss, usually caused by chronic middle ear infections, or per- forations that do not heal. This is usually a same day surgery, performed under either local or general anesthe- sia. After making an incision in the ear to view the perfo- ration, the ear drum is elevated away from the ear canal and lifted forward. If the bones of hearing (ossicular chain) are functioning, tissue is taken from the ear and grafted to the eardrum to close the perforation. A thin sheet of silastic and Gelfoam hold the graft in place. The ear is stitched together, and a sterile patch is placed on the outside of the ear canal. Tympanoplasty is successful in over 90% of all cases. The need for ossicular recon- struction (reconstruction of tiny bones of the middle ear) is sometimes known before surgery and and even when identified during surgery, can usually be done while reconstructing the eardrum. If the gap between the anvil bone and the stapes is small, a small piece of bone or car- tilage from the patient can be inserted; if is is large, the incus bone is removed, modelled into a prosthesis, and reinserted between the stapes and the malleus. Recon- struction could also be achieved by inserting a strut made from artificial bone. For tympanoplasty with ossicular reconstruction, the patient usually stays in the hospital overnight. The recovery period is about four weeks. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed to drain ear fluid and prevent ear infections when antibi- otics don\u2019t work or when ear infections are chronic. The process normalizes pressure in the middle ear and decreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per- formed on infants and children, in whom ear infections are most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears. The surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, then uses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal or plastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continual drainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it stays in place, which varies from six months to three years. When the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of 25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubes may need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic for most children and a local anesthetic for older children or adults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce- dure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can go home the same day; children under three years of age and those with chronic diseases usually stay overnight. Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per- formed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. In most cases, this is performed in a surgeon\u2019s office using a topical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur- face of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and the eardrum to close. A thin patch placed on the eardrum\u2019s outer surface allows the skin under the eardrum to heal. Cochlear implants Cochlear implants stimulate nerve ends within the inner ear, enabling deaf children to hear. The device has a microphone that remains outside the ear, a processor that selects and codes speech sounds, and a receiver/stimulator to convert the coded sounds to electric signals that stimulate the hearing nerve and are recognized by the brain as sound. During surgery, an incision is made behind and slightly above the ear. A circular hole is drilled in the bone to receive the device\u2019s internal coil. The mastoid bone leading to the middle ear is opened to receive the electrodes. The internal coil is inserted and secured, followed by the electrodes. The wound is stitched up and when it heals, an external unit comprised of a stimulator with a microphone is worn behind the ear. Performed in a hospital under general anes- thesia, the operation takes about two hours and usually requires a hospital stay overnight. The patient can resume normal activities in two to three weeks.

          "content": "Cosmetic dentistry Definition Cosmetic dentistry includes a variety of dental treat- ments aimed at improving the appearance of the teeth. Purpose The purpose of cosmetic dentistry is to improve the appearance of the teeth using bleaching, bonding, veneers, reshaping, orthodontics, or implants. Description Bleaching is done to lighten teeth that are stained or discolored. It entails the use of a bleaching solution applied by a dentist or a gel in a tray that fits over the teeth used at home under a dentist\u2019s supervision. Bond- ing involves applying tooth-colored plastic putty, called composite resin, to the surface of chipped or broken teeth. This resin is also used to fill cavities in front teeth (giving a more natural-looking result) and to fill gaps between teeth. Veneers are thin, porcelain shells that cover the front of the teeth. They can improve the appearance of damaged, discolored, misshapen, or mis- aligned teeth. Reshaping involves the removal of enam- el from a misshapen tooth so that it matches other teeth. Orthodontics uses braces to correct the position of crowded or misaligned teeth. Implants are artificial teeth which are attached directly to the jaw to replace missing teeth. Preparation Bleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching tray made by the dentist. This tray is worn at home for several hours each day or night. Teeth slowly become white over a period of one to six weeks. Bleaching can also be done in a dentist\u2019s office. A heat- or light-activated bleaching solution is applied to six to eight teeth per visit. Bonding involves etching the surface of the tooth so composite resin can adhere. The dentist then contours the resin to the right shape, and smooths and polishes the resin after it is hard and dry. To prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer of enamel is removed from the tooth (so that the finished tooth will be flush with surrounding teeth) and an impres- sion of the tooth is taken from which the veneer will be created. Before a veneer is applied, the tooth is etched with an acid solution and an adhesive resin is painted on the tooth. The veneer is then applied, the resin is hardened with a bonding light, and the dentist polishes the veneer. KEY TERMS Bleaching \u2014Technique used to brighten stained teeth. Bonding \u2014Rebuilding, reshaping, and covering tooth defects using tooth-colored materials. Composite resin\u2014Plastic material matching natur- al tooth color used to replace missing parts of a tooth. During cosmetic reshaping, some enamel is removed from the uneven tooth so it more closely match- es other teeth. Orthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth, and wires are threaded through the braces. These wires are adjusted to gradually move the teeth to the desired new positions. Over time, crowded or misaligned teeth are straightened. Implants are more secure and natural looking than dentures or bridgework, but are much more expensive. First an anchor for the implant is attached to the jaw bone. This surgery can take several hours. About six months later, after the bone around the anchor has healed, a post is attached to the anchor, and an artificial tooth is attached to the post. The whole process may take about nine months to complete. Aftercare Periodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth white if the teeth have been bleached or bonded. Also, the resin used in bonded teeth can be chipped by ice, popcorn kernels, or hard candy, requiring repair. Veneered teeth may need to be reveneered after five to 12 years. Once orthodontic braces are removed, regular visits to the orthodontist are advised because teeth can shift position. Implanted teeth require regular dental checkups to ensure that the anchor and post are stable. Risks After teeth are bleached, they may darken faster if exposed to staining products such as coffee or tobacco. Some patients experience increased sensitivity to cold while teeth are being bleached, but the sensitivity usually disappears shortly after completion of the treatment. Bonded teeth, like bleached teeth, may also stain more easily than natural teeth. Bonding materials also chip easily. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 939 Cosmetic dentistry",

          "content": "Precautions Pregnant patients undergoing x-ray exams should carefully review the risks and benefits with their doctors. Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do not involve radiation levels that are harmful to the unborn baby. Description Manometry This study is designed to measure the pressure changes produced by contraction of the muscular por- tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function of any one of the segments of the swallowing tube causes difficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys- phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating those patients whose endoscopy is negative. During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube carrying a device that senses changes in pressures in the esophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal- lowing. Medications are sometimes given during the study to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans- mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can best identify diseases that produce disturbances of motility or contractions of the esophagus. Esophageal pH monitoring This procedure involves measuring the esophagus\u2019 exposure to acid that has \u201crefluxed\u201d from the stomach. The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn or GERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, but also ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing (strictures) when they heal. Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux. Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp- tying and production of saliva are other important protec- tive mechanisms. \u201cpH\u201d is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in the esophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per- sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has been designed to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu- ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their daily routine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in their activities they occurred. During this period, a thin tube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to record changes. After the study, a computer is used to compare changes in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient. Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of many patients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge the effects of drug therapy. X-ray tests These fall into two categories: (1) those done with the use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per- formed with radioactive materials. Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest value in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph- agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal function test, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnostic possibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated with barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction. During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the passage of material through the esophagus in real time, and video recordings can also be done. This is particularly useful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com- mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke, although other diseases of the neuromuscular system (like myasthenia gravis) can produce the same symptoms. Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are use- ful because they are able not only to demonstrate that food passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor- mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow- ing food coated with material that is followed by a nuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when other methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it is necessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. As of 1997, scans mainly served as research tools. Preparation Patients should not eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Many medications affect the esopha- gus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or even stopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of all medications taken, including over-the-counter medica- tions (purchased without a doctor\u2019s prescription), and any known allergies. Aftercare For most of these studies, no special care is needed after the procedure. Patients can often go about normal daily activities following any of these tests. One excep- tion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the use of barium. This can have a constipating effect and patients should ask about using a mild laxative later on.

          "content": "Other studies of esophageal function are essen- tially free of any significant risk. The tubes passed during these procedures are small, and most patients adjust to them quite well. However, since medications cannot be used to relax patients, some may not tolerate the exam. Abnormal results Manometry is used to diagnose abnormalities relat- ed to contraction or relaxation of the various muscular regions of the esophagus. These studies cannot distin- guish whether injury to either the muscle or nerves of the esophagus is producing the abnormal results. Only the final effect on esophageal muscle is identified. Results should be interpreted in light of the patient\u2019s entire med- ical history. For example, there are many diseases that cause poor relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. When no cause is found, the disease is called achalasia. Abnormal results of pH tests can confirm symptoms of heartburn or indicate a cause of chest pain (or rarely, swallowing difficulties). Doctors may want to start or change medications based on these results, or even repeat the test using different doses of medication. As noted above, these studies are indicated before surgical treat- ment of GERD. X-ray tests can only serve to document an abnormal- ity, and they are far from perfect. If they are negative, then other studies are often needed. Resources BOOKS Clouse, Ray E., and N. E.

Description The esophagus is a muscular tube that propels food into the stomach. A defect in the wall of the esophagus may allow the lining to herniate, creating a space where food can be caught. Pouches can appear anywhere between the throat and the stomach. They occur primari- ly in men and usually later in life. Different names for the condition apply to different locations along the esophagus: \u2022 Zenker\u2019s diverticula are pharyngeal pouches, or ones that occur in the upper neck area at the top of the esoph- agus. \u2022 Traction diverticula are a type of mid-esophageal pouch. \u2022 Epiphrenic diverticula occur at the bottom of the esoph- agus near where it enters the stomach. Causes and symptoms To propel food into the stomach (or out of it during vomiting) the esophagus generates internal pressure just like the bowel. Under certain circumstances, that pressure can herniate the esophageal lining through a weakness in the wall, creating a pouch (a balloon squeezed in the hand will herniate through the fingers in the same way). Pouch- es are more common in people who have motility disor- ders of the esophagus, swallowing that is not well coordi- nated and may be spastic. A traction diverticulum can develop from a scar that pulls the esophagus out of shape. Food and saliva can collect in all of these pouches. Pouches in the neck usually cause bad breath (hali- tosis) and the regurgitation of swallowed food and saliva. Some patients with Zenker\u2019s diverticula can push on their neck and make old food appear in their mouths. Pouches near the stomach may cause swallowing problems, condi- tions known as achalasia or dysphagia. Mid-esophageal pouches usually cause no symptoms. In the most serious cases, a person may be unable to swallow because the esophagus is obstructed, or the esphagus may rupture, spilling its contents into the chest or neck.

          "content": "Diagnosis Swallowing problems usually call for esopha- gograms. In the x ray department, the patient is given a contrast agent to drink. During swallowing, x rays record the passage of the agent down the esophagus and into the stomach. Instead of a straight tube with well-coordinated waves of contraction, the resulting x rays show a writhing organ resembling a giant corkscrew. Another test that is used in many disorders of esophageal motility is manometry. Pressures inside the esophagus are measured every inch or so using a balloon device that is passed all the way down to the stomach. The result is a precise record of its activity that yields a specific diagnosis. Treatment Soft and liquid foods pass more easily than solid pieces. Medications of several types are helpful\u2014 nifedipine, hydralazine, isoproterenol, and nitrates being the most successful. Several other treatments have uncer- tain results. For severe cases, relief is obtained two-thirds of the time by cutting the muscles along the entire length of the esophagus. This is a major surgical procedure. Prognosis This condition does not go away, nor is treatment entirely satisfactory. Patients need to be careful of what they eat and continue on medication if a beneficial one is found. Fortunately, the condition does not get progres- sively worse as time passes. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med- icine. Philadelphia: W. B.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD DiGeorge syndrome Definition DiGeorge syndrome (also called congenital thymic hypoplasia, or third and fourth pharyngeal pouch syn- drome) is a birth defect that is caused by an abnormal chromosome and affects the baby\u2019s immune system. The syndrome is marked by absence or underdevelopment of the thymus and parathyroid glands. It is named for the pediatrician who first described it in 1965. Description The prevalence of DiGeorge syndrome is debated; the estimates range from 1:4000 to 1:6395. Because the symptoms caused by the chromosomal abnormality vary somewhat from patient to patient, the syndrome probably occurs much more often than was previously thought. DiGeorge syndrome is sometimes described as one of the \u201cCATCH 22\u201d disorders, so named because of their characteristics\u2014cardiac defects, abnormal facial features, thymus underdevelopment, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia\u2014caused by a deletion of several genes in chromosome 22. The specific facial features associated with DiGeorge syndrome include low-set ears, wide-set eyes, a small jaw, and a short groove in the upper lip. The male/female ratio is 1:1. The syndrome appears to be equally common in all racial and ethnic groups. Causes and symptoms DiGeorge syndrome is caused either by inheritance of a defective chromosome 22 or by a new defect in chro- mosome 22 in the fetus. The type of defect that is involved is called deletion. A deletion occurs when the genetic material in the chromosomes does not recombine properly during the formation of sperm or egg cells. The deletion means that several genes from chromosome 22 are missing in DiGeorge syndrome patients. According to a 1999 study, 6% of children with DiGeorge syndrome inherited the deletion from a parent, while 94% had a new deletion.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD Esophageal ulcers see Ulcers (digestive) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Definition An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterolo- gy (the medical study of the stomach and intestines) is a thin, flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is limited to the examination of the inside of the gastrointestinal tract\u2019s upper portion, it is called upper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). With the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes- tine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent- ly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam. Purpose EGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as: \u2022 upper abdominal or chest pain \u2022 nausea or vomiting \u2022 difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) \u2022 bleeding from the upper intestinal tract \u2022 anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat certain conditions, such as an area of narrowing or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract Upper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for detecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used to diagnose early cancer and can frequently determine whether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Biopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or \u201csus- picious\u201d areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol- ogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc- tion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of cancer or infections. When treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti- nal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo- scope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), or remove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). In addition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treated by a number of endoscopic techniques. Recent studies have shown the usefulness of endo- scopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom- ach. This is done either with injection of certain materi- als (like alcohol), or with the use of instruments (like lasers) that burn the tumor. Other techniques combining medications and lasers also show promise. Precautions Patients should inquire as to the doctor\u2019s expertise with these procedures, especially when therapy is the main goal. The doctor should be informed of any aller- gies, medication use, and medical problems. Description First, a \u201ctopical\u201d (local) medication to numb the gag reflex is given either by spray or is gargled. Patients are usually sedated for the procedure (though not always) by injection of medications into a vein. The endoscopist then has the patient swallow the scope, which is passed through the upper gastrointestinal tract. The lens or cam- era at the end of the instrument allows the endoscopist to examine each portion of the upper gastrointestinal tract; photos can be taken for reference. Air is pumped in through the instrument to allow proper observation. Biopsies and other procedures can be performed without any significant discomfort.

          "content": "Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with swallowing and chest pain. Because the esophagus does not empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs caus- ing cough, bronchitis , and repeated bouts of pneumo- nia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition become a significant factor in affecting survival. Involvement of the large intestine (colon) causes constipation, distention, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis The best way to diagnose acute infection is to identi- fy the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally it is pos- sible to culture the organism from infected tissue, but this process usually requires too much time to be of value. In the chronic phase, antibody levels can be measured. Efforts to develop new, more accurate tests are ongoing. Treatment In most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is possible. Present medications can reduce the duration and severity of an acute infection, but are only 50% effective, at best, in eliminating the organisms. Cardiac effects are managed with pacemakers and medications. Esophageal complications require either endoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophageal emptying, similar to those used to treat the disorder known as achalasia . Constipation is treated by increas- ing fiber and bulk laxatives, or removal of diseased por- tions of the colon. KEY TERMS Achalasia \u2014An esophageal disease of unknown cause, in which the lower sphincter or muscle is unable to relax normally, and leads to the accu- mulation of material within the esophagus. Endoscopy \u2014Exam using an endoscope (a thin flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature cam- era to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract). When the procedure is performed to exam- ine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pan- creas, the organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirectly through the injection of x ray. Parasite\u2014An organism that lives on or in another and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that organism. Regurgitation \u2014Flow of material back up the esophagus and into the throat or lungs. Prognosis Those patients with gastrointestinal complications often respond to some form of treatment. Cardiac prob- lems are more difficult to treat, particularly since trans- plant would rekindle infection. Prevention Visitors traveling to areas of known infection should avoid staying in mud, adobe, or similar huts. Mosquito nets and insect repellents are useful in helping to avoid contact with the bugs. Blood screening is not always effective in many regions where infection is common. It is necessary to carefully screen people who have emi- grated from Central and South America before they make blood donations.

Sometimes the patient may also experience pain in the chest resem- bling a heart attack. A series of x rays taken while swal- lowing a contrast agent usually demonstrates the divertic- ulum clearly. An esophagoscopy may also be needed to gather more detail. Manometry, measuring pressures inside the esophagus using a balloon that is passed down it, may help determine the cause of the diverticula. Treatment Treatment for this condition is primarily aimed at alleviating symptoms. Physicians direct the patient to eat a bland diet, to chew his or her food thoroughly, and to drink water after eating to clean out the pouches. If the condition is severe, several types of surgery are available to remove the pouches and repair the defects. If a pouch is due to a stenosis (narrowing) in the esophagus it may be possible to relieve it by passing a dilator through it, a process called bougeinage.

Esophageal diverticula see Esophageal pouches Esophageal function tests Definition The esophagus is the swallowing tube through which food passes on its way from the mouth to the stomach. The main function of this organ is to propel food down into the stomach. There is also a mechanism to prevent food from coming back up or \u201crefluxing\u201d from the stomach into the esophagus. Esophageal function tests are used to determine if these processes are normal or abnormal. Purpose The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also has two muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom. All of these muscular areas must contract in an exact sequence for swallowing to proceed normally. There are three main symptoms that occur when esophageal function is abnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia),heart- burn, and chest pain. Doctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these symptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of esophageal function, is often used to determine if the lining of the esophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or areas of narrowing (strictures). Many times, however, endoscopy only shows the doctor if there is injury to the esophageal lining, and the procedure gives no information about the cause of the problem. Therefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies are available that measure esophageal function. There are three basic types of tests used to assess esophageal func- tion: \u2022 Manometry is used to study the way the muscles of the esophagus contract, and is most useful for the investi- gation of difficulty with swallowing. \u2022 Esophageal pH monitoring measures changes in esophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluating patients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis- ease (GERD). \u2022 X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They either follow the progress of barium during swallowing using a fluoroscope, or they use radioactive scanning techniques. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21242 Esophageal function tests",

Precautions Circumcision should not be performed on infants with certain deformities of the penis that may require a portion of the foreskin for repair. The most common con- dition for surgery using the foreskin is hypospadias, a congenital deformity of the penis where the urinary tract opening is not at the tip of the glans. Also, infants with a large hydrocoele or hernia may suffer important compli- cations through circumcision. Premature infants and infants with serious infections are also poor candidates to be circumcised, as are infants with hemophilia , other bleeding disorders, or whose mothers had taken anticoag- ulant drugs. In older boys or men, circumcision is a minor procedure. Therefore, it can be performed in virtually anyone without a serious illness or unusual deformity. Description The foreskin of the penis protects the sensitivity of the glans and shields it from irritation by urine, feces, and foreign materials. It also protects the urinary opening against infection and incidental injury. In circumcision of infants, the foreskin is pulled tightly into a specially designed clamp, and the foreskin pulls away from the broadened tip of the penis. Pressure from the clamp stops bleeding from blood vessels that supplied the foreskin.

Preparation Despite a long-standing belief that infants do not experience serious pain from circumcision, most author- ities now believe that some form of local anesthesia is necessary. The physician injects local anesthesia at the base of the penis or under the skin around the penis (sub- cutaneous ring block). Both anesthetics block key nerves. EMLA cream, a topical formula of several anes- thetics can also be used. Aftercare After circumcision, the wound should be washed daily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may be applied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound dress- ing will be present and should be changed each time the diaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is used instead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off in five to eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10 days. Infants who undergo circumcision may be fussy for some hours afterward, so parents should be prepared for crying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generally these go away within a day. In older boys, the penis may be painful, but this will go away gradually. A topical anesthet- ic ointment or spray may be used to relieve this temporary discomfort. There may also be a \u201cbruise\u201d on the penis, which typically goes away with no particular attention. Risks Complications following newborn circumcision appear in one out of every 500 procedures. Most compli- cations are minor. Bleeding occurs in half of the compli- cations and is usually easy to control. Infections are rare and present with fever and signs of inflammation. There may be injuries to the penis itself, and these may be difficult to repair. In 2000, there were reports that the surgical clamps used in circumcision were at fault in over 100 injuries reported between July 1996 and January 2000. In nearly all cases, the clamps were assumed to be in working order but had been repaired with replacement parts that were not of the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Physicians were urged to inspect the clamps before use and ensure that their dimensions fit their infant patients. Resources BOOKS Gollaher, David L.

Description Cirrhosis changes the structure of the liver and the blood vessels that nourish it. The disease reduces the liver\u2019s ability to manufacture proteins and process hor- mones, nutrients, medications, and poisons. Cirrhosis gets worse over time and can become potentially life threatening.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women have undergone some form of FGM. As a very deeply rooted cultural and religious tradition still prac- ticed in over 28 African and Asian countries, up to two million girls per year are at risk. The following countries have the highest number of occurrences of FGM: Dji- bouti (98%), Egypt (97%), Eritrea (95%), Guinea (99%), Mali (94%), Sierra Leone (90%), and Somalia (98- 100%). As more people move to Western countries from countries where female circumcision is performed, the practice has come to the attention of health professionals in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. In an effort to integrate old customs with modern medical care, some immigrant families have requested that physicians perform the procedure. While trying to be sensitive to cultural traditions, health care providers are sometimes put in the difficult position of choosing to perform this procedure in a medical facili- ty under sanitary conditions, or refusing the request, knowing that it may be done anyway with no medical supervision. Some families who are intent on having this procedure done will take their daughters back to the country they immigrated from in order to have the girls circumcised. Many national and international medical organiza- tions including the American Medical Association (AMA), Canadian medical organizations, and WHO oppose the practice of female genital mutilation. The United Nations (UN) considers female genital mutilation a violation of human rights. WHO has undertaken a num- ber of projects aimed at decreasing the incidence of FGM. These include the following activities: \u2022 publishing a statement addressing the regional status of FGM and encouraging the development of national pol- icy against its practice, \u2022 organizing training for regional community workers, \u2022 developing educational materials for local health care workers, \u2022 providing alternative occupations for individuals who perform FGM procedures. Aftercare A girl or young woman who has recently had the procedure performed may require supportive care to con- trol bleeding and antibiotics to prevent infection. Women who were circumcised as children may require medical care to treat complications. Pregnant women KEY TERMS Circumcision \u2014A procedure, usually with reli- gious or cultural significance, where the prepuce or skin covering the tip of the penis on a boy, or the clitoris on a girl, is cut away. Clitoridectomy \u2014A procedure where the clitoris and possibly some of the surrounding labial tissue at the opening of the vagina is cut away. Infibulation\u2014A procedure where the tissue around the vagina is sewn shut, leaving only a small open- ing for the passage of urine and menstrual blood. who have been infibulated may have to have the labial tissue cut open to allow the baby to be delivered. After- care should be provided with a supportive and nonjudg- mental approach towards the girls and women who have undergone this procedure. Risks The immediate risks after the procedure are hemor- rhage (excessive bleeding), severe pain, and infection (including abscesses, tetanus, and gangrene). The most severe consequence is death due to excessive blood loss. Long term complications include scarring, interference with the drainage of urine and menstrual blood, chronic urinary tract infections, pelvic and back pain, and infer- tility. Sexual intercourse can be painful. Complications of childbirth are also a risk. It is unclear whether it is related to the procedure itself, or related to the general condition of medical practice, but infant and maternal death rates are generally higher in those communities where female circumcision is practiced.

Altha Roberts Edgren Female sexual arousal disorder Definition Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) occurs when a woman is continually unable to attain or maintain arousal and lubrication during intercourse, is unable to reach orgasm, or has no desire for sexual intercourse. Description The disorder typically affects up to 25 percent of all American women, or an estimated 47 million women. Three-fourths of women with FSAD are postmenopausal. Women describe it as being \u201cunable to get turned on,\u201d or being continually disinterested in sex. It is also called \u201cfrigidity.\u201d Other terms for the disorder include dyspareu- nia and vaginismus, both of which involve pain during intercourse. Causes and symptoms There are numerous causes of this disorder. They include: \u2022 physical problems, such as endometriosis , cystitis,o r vaginitis \u2022 systemic problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or hypothyroidism. Even pregnancy or the postpartum period (time after delivery of a child) may affect desire. Menopauseis also known to reduce sexual desire. \u2022 medications, including oral contraceptives , anti- depressants, antihypertensives, and tranquilizers \u2022 surgery, such as mastectomy or hysterectomy which may affect how a woman feels about her sexual self. \u2022 stress \u2022 depression \u2022 use of alcohol, drugs, or cigarette smoking Symptoms vary. A woman may have no desire for sex, or may not be able to maintain arousal, or may be unable to reach orgasm. She may also have pain during sex or orgasm, which interferes with her desire for inter- course. Diagnosis To make a diagnosis, a woman\u2019s physician - either family doctor, gynecologist, or even urologist \u2014 takes a complete medical history to determine when the problem started, how it presents, how severe it is, and what the patient thinks may be causing it. The doctor will also conduct a complete physical examination , looking for any abnormalities in the genital region Treatment The physician should start by providing education about the disorder and recommending various non-med- ical treatment strategies. These include: \u2022 use of erotic materials, such as vibrators, books, maga- zines and videos \u2022 sensual massage, avoiding the genitals \u2022 position changes to reduce pain \u2022 use of lubricants to moisten the vagina and genital area \u2022 kegel exercises to strengthen the vagina and clitoris \u2022 therapy to overcome any relationship or sexual abuse issues Medical treatments include: \u2022 estrogen replacement therapy, which may help with vaginal dryness, pain and arousal \u2022 testosterone therapy in women who have low levels of this male hormone (side effects, however, may include deepening voice, hair growth, and acne) \u2022 the EROS clitoral therapy device (EROS-CTD), recent- ly approved by the Food and Drug Administration; a small vacuum pump, placed over the clitoris and gently activated to provide a gentle suction designed to increase blood flow to the region, which, in turn, helps with arousal \u2022 using the herb yohimbine combined with nitric oxide has been found to increase vaginal blood flow in post- menopausal women and thus help with some forms of FSAD Alternative treatment Natural estrogens, such as those found in soy prod- ucts and flax, may be effective. Herbal remedies include belladonna, gingko, and motherwort. However, there is no scientific evidence to prove these herbs actually help.

Purpose In the United States, circumcision in infant boys is performed for social, medical, or cultural/religious rea- sons. Once a routine operation urged by pediatricians and obstetricians for newborns in the middle of the twen- tieth century, circumcision has become an elective option that parents make for their sons on an individual basis. Families who practice Judaism or Islam may select to have their sons circumcised as a religious practice. Oth- ers choose circumcision for medical benefits. Female circumcision (also known as female genital mutilation) is usually performed for cultural and social reasons by family members and others who are not mem- bers of the medical profession, with no anesthesia. Not only is the prepuce removed but often the vaginal open- ing is sewn to make it smaller. This practice is supposed to ensure the virginity of a bride on her wedding day. It also prevents the woman from achieving sexual pleasure during coitus. This practice is not universally approved by the medical profession and is considered by some as a human rights violation. Though the incidence of male circumcision has decreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still the most common surgical operation in the United States. Circumcision rates are much lower for the rest of the industrialized world. In Britain, it is only done for reli- gious practices or to correct a specific medical condition of the penis. Some of the medical reasons parents choose cir- cumcision are to protect against infections of the uri- nary tract and the foreskin, prevent cancer , lower the risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases , and pre- vent phimosis (a tightening of the foreskin that may close the opening of the penis).

Female condom see Condom Female genital mutilation Definition Female genital mutilation (FGM) is the cutting, or partial or total removal, of the external female genitalia for cultural, religious, or other non-medical reasons. It is usually performed on girls between the ages of four and 10. It is also called female circumcision. Purpose FGM results in the cutting or removal of the tissues around the vagina that give women pleasurable sexual feelings. This procedure is used for social and cultural control of women\u2019s sexuality. In its most extreme form, infibulation, where the girl\u2019s vagina is sewn shut, the pro- cedure ensures virginity. In some cultures where female circumcision has been a tradition for hundreds of years, this procedure is considered a rite of passage for young girls. Families fear that if their daughters are left uncir- cumcised, they may not be marriageable. As in most cul- tures, there is also the fear that the girl might bring shame to the family by being sexually active and becom- ing pregnant before marriage. Precautions It is illegal to perform FGM in many countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt, Kenya, and Sene- gal. This procedure is usually done in the home or some- where other than a medical setting. Often, it is performed by a family member or by a local \u201ccircumciser,\u201d using knives, razor blades, or other tools that may not be steril- ized before use. Description Female circumcision includes a wide range of pro- cedures. The simplest form involves a small cut to the clitoris or labial tissue. A Sunna circumcision removes the prepuce (a fold of skin that covers the clitoris) and/or the tip of the clitoris. A clitoridectomy removes the entire clitoris and some or all of the surrounding tissue; this procedure occurs in approximately 80% of cases. The most extreme form of genital mutilation is excision and infibulation, in which the clitoris and all of the surround tissue are cut away and the remaining skin is sewn together. Only a small opening is left for the passage of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21306 Female genital mutilation",

          "content": "The body\u2019s allergic reactions may include repeated episodes of fever, shaking chills, sweating, headaches, vomiting, and pain. Enlarged lymph nodes, swelling of the affected area, skin ulcers, bone and joint pain, tired- ness, and red streaks along the arm or leg also may occur. Abscesses can form in lymph nodes or in the lymphatic vessels. They may appear at the surface of the skin as well. Long-term infection with lymphatic filariasis can lead to lymphedema, hydrocele (a buildup of fluid in any saclike cavity or duct) in the scrotum, and elephantiasis of the legs, scrotum, arms, penis, breasts, and vulvae. The most common site of elephantiasis is the leg. It typically begins in the ankle and progresses to the foot and leg. At first the swollen leg may feel soft to the touch but eventu- ally becomes hard and thick. The skin may appear dark- ened or warty and may even crack, allowing bacteria to infect the leg and complicate the disease. The microfilari- ae usually don\u2019t cause injury. In some instances, they cause \u201ceosinophilia,\u201d an increased number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cells) in the blood. This disease is more intense in people who never have been exposed to lymphatic filariasis than it is in the native people of tropical areas where the disease occurs. This is because many of the native people often are immunologically tolerant. Diagnosis The only sure way to diagnose lymphatic filariasis is by detecting the parasite itself, either the adult worms or the microfilariae. Microscopic examination of the person\u2019s blood may reveal microfilariae. But many times, people who have been infected for a long time do not have microfilariae in their bloodstream. The absence of them, therefore, does not mean necessarily that the person is not infected. In these cases, examining the urine or hydrocele fluid or performing other clinical tests is necessary. Collecting blood from the individual for microscopic examination should be done during the night when the microfilariae are more numerous in the bloodstream. (Interestingly, this is when mosquitoes bite most frequent- ly.) During the day microfilariae migrate to deeper blood vessels in the body, especially in the lung. If it is decided to perform the blood test during the day, the infected indi- vidual may be given a \u201cprovocative\u201d dose of medication to provoke the microfilariae to enter the bloodstream. Blood then can be collected an hour later for examination. Detecting the adult worms can be difficult because they are deep within the lymphatic system and difficult to get to. Biopsies usually are not performed because they usually don\u2019t reveal much information. Treatment The drug of choice in treating lymphatic filariasis is diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The trade name in the United States is Hetrazan. The treatment schedule is typically 2 mg/kg per day, three times a day, for three weeks. The drug is taken in tablet form. DEC kills the microfilariae quickly and injures or kills the adult worms slowly, if at all. If all the adult worms are not killed, remaining paired males and females may continue to produce more larvae. There- fore, several courses of DEC treatment over a long time period may be necessary to rid the individual of the parasites. DEC has been shown to reduce the size of enlarged lymph nodes and, when taken long-term, to reduce ele- phantiasis. In India, DEC has been given in the form of a medicated salt, which helps prevent spread of the disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1167 Elephantiasis Man suffering from elephantiasis.

The long, threadlike worms block the body\u2019s lymphatic sys- tem\u2014a network of channels, lymph nodes, and organs that helps maintain proper fluid levels in the body by draining lymph from tissues into the bloodstream. This blockage causes fluids to collect in the tissues, which can lead to great swelling, called \u201clymphedema.\u201d Limbs can swell so enormously that they resemble an elephant\u2019s foreleg in size, texture, and color. This is the severely dis- figuring and disabling condition of elephantiasis. There are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but the agents responsible for most of the elephantiasis in the world are filarial worms: white, slender round worms found in most tropical and subtropical places. They are transmitted by particular kinds (species) of mosquitoes, that is, bloodsucking insects. Infection with these worms is called \u201clymphatic filariasis\u201d and over a long period of time can cause elephantiasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a disease of underdeveloped regions found in South America, Central Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It is a disease that has been present for centuries, as ancient Persian and Indian writings clearly described elephant-like swellings of the arms, legs, and genitals. It is estimated that 120 million people in the world have lymphatic filariasis, as of 1997. The disease appears to be spreading, in spite of decades of research in this area. Other terms for elephantiasis are Barbados leg, ele- phant leg, morbus herculeus, mal de Cayenne, and myelolymphangioma. Other situations that can lead to elephantiasis are: \u2022 a protozoan disease called leishmaniasis \u2022 a repeated streptococcal infection \u2022 the surgical removal of lymph nodes (usually to prevent the spread of cancer) \u2022 a hereditary birth defect Causes and symptoms Three kinds of round worms cause elephantiasis filar- iasis: Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi , and Brugia timori. Of these three,W. bancroftimakes up about 90% of the cases. Man is the only known host of W. bancrofti. Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes are the car- riers of W. bancrofti. Anopheles and Mansonia mosqui- toes are the carriers of B. malayi. In addition, Anopheles mosquitoes are the carriers of B. timori. Infected female mosquitoes take a blood meal from a human, and, in doing so, introduce larval forms of the particular parasite they carry to the person. These larvae migrate toward a lymphatic channel, then travel to vari- ous places within the lymphatic system, usually position- ing themselves in or near lymph nodes throughout the body. During this time, they mature into more developed larvae and eventually into adult worms. Depending upon the species of round worm, this development can take a few months or more than a year. The adult worms grow to about 1 in (2.5 cm) to 4 in (10 cm) long. The adult worms can live from about three to eight years. Some have been known to live to 20 years, and in one case 40 years. The adult worms begin reproducing numerous live embryos, called microfilariae. The micro- filariae travel to the bloodstream, where they can be ingested by a mosquito when it takes a blood meal from the infected person. If they are not ingested by a mosqui- to, the microfilariae die within about 12 months. If they are ingested by a mosquito, they continue to mature. They are totally dependent on their specific species of mosquito to develop further. The cycle continues when the mosquito takes another blood meal. Most of the symptoms an infected person experi- ences are due to the blockage of the lymphatic system by the adult worms and due to the substances (excretions and secretions) produced by the worms.

Lata Cherath, PhD Filariasis Definition Filiariasis is the name for a group of tropical dis- eases caused by various thread-like parasitic round worms (nematodes) and their larvae. The larvae transmit the disease to humans through a mosquito bite. Filariasis is characterized by fever, chills, headache , and skin lesions in the early stages and, if untreated, can progress to include gross enlargement of the limbs and genitalia in a condition called elephantiasis. Description Approximately 170 million people in the tropical and subtropical areas of southeast Asia, South America, Africa, and the islands of the Pacific are affected by this debilitat- ing parasitic disease. While filariasis is rarely fatal, it is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disabili- ty in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named filariasis one of only six \u201cpotentially eradica- ble\u201d infectious diseases and has embarked upon a 20-year campaign to eradicate the disease. In all cases, a mosquito first bites an infected indi- vidual then bites another uninfected individual, transfer- ring some of the worm larvae to the new host. Once with- in the body, the larvae migrate to a particular part of the body and mature to adult worms. Filariasis is classified into three distinct types according to the part of the body that becomes infected: lymphatic filariasis affects the cir- culatory system that moves tissue fluid and immune cells (lymphatic system); subcutaneous filariasis infects the areas beneath the skin and whites of the eye; and serous cavity filariasis infects body cavities but does not cause disease. Several different types of worms can be respon- sible for each type of filariasis, but the most common species include the following: Wucheria bancrofti, Bru- gia malayi (lymphatic filariasis), Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa, Mansonella streptocerca, Dracunculus medi- nensis (subcutaneous filariasis), Mansonella pustans , and Mansonella ozzardi (serous cavity filariasis). The two most common types of the disease are Ban- croftian and Malayan filariasis, both forms of lymphatic filariasis. The Bancroftian variety is found throughout Africa, southern and southeastern Asia, the Pacific islands, and the tropical and subtropical regions of South America and the Caribbean. Malayan filariasis occurs only in southern and southeastern Asia. Filariasis is occa- sionally found in the United States, especially among immigrants from the Caribbean and Pacific islands. A larvae matures into an adult worm within six months to one year and can live between four and six years. Each female worm can produce millions of larvae, and these larvae only appear in the bloodstream at night, when they may be transmitted, via an insect bite, to anoth- er host. A single bite is usually not enough to acquire an infection, therefore, short-term travelers are usually safe. A series of multiple bites over a period of time is required to establish an infection. As a result, those individuals who are regularly active outdoors at night and those who spend more time in remote jungle areas are at an increased risk of contracting the filariasis infection. Causes and symptoms In cases of lymphatic filariasis, the most common form of the disease, the disease is caused by the adult worms actually living in the lymphatic vessels near the lymph nodes where they distort the vessels and cause local inflammation. In advanced stages, the worms can actually obstruct the vessels, causing the surrounding tissue to become enlarged. In Bancroftian filariasis, the legs and genitals are most often involved, while the Malayan vari- ety affects the legs below the knees. Repeated episodes of inflammation lead to blockages of the lymphatic system, especially in the genitals and legs. This causes the affected area to become grossly enlarged, with thickened, coarse skin, leading to a condition called elephantiasis. In conjunctiva filariasis, the worms\u2019 larvae migrate to the eye and can sometimes be seen moving beneath the skin or beneath the white part of the eye (conjuncti- va). If untreated, this disease can cause a type of blind- ness known as onchocerciasis. Symptoms vary, depending on what type of parasitic worm has caused the infection, but all infections usually GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1330 Filariasis",

          "content": "begin with chills, headache, and fever between three months and one year after the insect bite. There may also be swelling, redness, and pain in the arms, legs, or scro- tum. Areas of pus (abscesses) may appear as a result of dying worms or a secondary bacterial infection. Diagnosis The disease is diagnosed by taking a patient history, performing a physical examination , and by screening blood specimens for specific proteins produced by the immune system in response to this infection (antibodies). Early diagnosis may be difficult because, in the first stages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections. To make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for a pattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc- tion, together with the patient\u2019s possible exposure to filariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar- vae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, but because mosquitos, which spread the disease, are active at night, the larvae are usually only found in the blood between about 10 pm and 2 am. Treatment Either ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba- mazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat- ing the larvae, impairing the adult worms\u2019 ability to reproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu- nately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible. The medication is started at low doses to prevent reac- tions caused by large numbers of dying parasites. While effective, the medications can cause severe side effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either of the drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the blood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can cause severe allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filled sores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlled using antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs (cor- ticosteroids). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine in someone with very high levels of parasite infection may lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain (encephali- tis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and confusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive numbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drug reactions include dizziness, weakness, and nausea. Symptoms caused by the death of the parasites include fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and asthma. Reactions usually begin within two days of start- ing treatment and may last between two and four days. No treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may be used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drain the fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery may also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro- tum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat- ing the legs and providing support with elastic bandages. Prognosis The outlook is good in early or mild cases, especially if the patient can avoid being infected again. The disease is rarely fatal, and with continued WHO medical inter- vention, even gross elephantiasis is now becoming rare. Prevention The best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent being repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry the disease. Some methods of preventing insect bites include the following: \u2022 limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or jungle areas \u2022 wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored clothing that attracts mosquitoes \u2022 avoid perfumes and colognes \u2022 treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per- methrin (Duramon, Permanone) \u2022 wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children, try citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects \u2022 if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor screens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep \u2022 use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less active In addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest- ed areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before being bitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien- tists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time. Resources BOOKS Infectious Disease. Ed. Barbara A. Bannister, et al.

For this reason, DEC must be given carefully to reduce the danger to the individual. Side effects may include fever, chills, headache, dizzi- ness, nausea and vomiting , itching , and joint pain. These side effects usually occur within the first few days of treatment. These side effects usually subside as the individual continues taking the drug. There is an alternate treatment plan for the use of DEC. This plan is designed to kill the parasites slowly (to reduce allergic reactions to the dead microfilariae and dying adult worms within the body). Lower doses of DEC are taken for the first few days, followed by the higher dose of 2 mg/kg per day for the remaining three weeks. In addition, steroids may be prescribed to prevent the indi- vidual\u2019s body from reacting severely to the dead worms. Another drug used is Ivermectin.

It is probable that patients will need to continue using DEC to kill the adult worms. Mild side effects of Ivermectin include headache, fever, and myalgia. Other means of managing lymphatic filariasis are pressure bandages to wrap the swollen limb and elastic stockings to help reduce the pressure. Exercising and ele- vating a bandaged limb also can help reduce its size. Surgery can be performed to reduce elephantiasis by removing excess fatty and fibrous tissue, draining the swelled area, and removing the dead worms. Prognosis With DEC treatment, the prognosis is good for early and mild cases of lymphatic filariasis. The prognosis is poor, however, for heavy parasitic infestations. Prevention The two main ways to control this disease are to take DEC preventively, which has shown to be effective, and to reduce the number of carrier insects in a particular area. Avoiding mosquito bites with insecticides and insect repellents is helpful, as is wearing protective clothing and using bed netting. Much effort has been made in cleaning the breeding sites (stagnant water) of mosquitoes near people\u2019s homes in areas where filariasis is found. Before visiting countries where lymphatic filariasis is found, it would be wise to consult a travel physician to learn about current preventative measures. Resources BOOKS Ash, Laurence R.

Prolonged snorting, for exam- ple, can irritate the nasal septum, producing nosebleeds, chronic runny nose, and other problems. Intravenous users face an increased risk of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Testing Drug testing can be useful in diagnosing and treating cocaine abuse. Urine testing can detect cocaine; besides providing an objective alternative to reliance on what a patient says, such tests can also be used as a follow-up to treatment to confirm that the patient has remained drug-free. Treatment The last two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment. But like all forms of drug abuse, cocaine abuse/addiction is a multi- faceted phenomenon involving environmental, social, and familial as well as physiological factors. This greatly complicates the challenge of effectively treating cocaine addiction. Pharmacological treatments To date, no medications have been approved specifi- cally for treating cocaine addiction. But several were under development at this writing. Selegeline, delivered either via a time-release pill or a transdermal patch, shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication. Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (also used to treat alcoholics) to be effective in treating cocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant medications are sometimes used to control the mood swings associat- ed with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal. Behavioral approaches A wide range of behavioral interventions have been successfully used to treat cocaine addiction. The approach used must be tailored to the specific needs of each individual patient, however. Contingency management rewards drug abstinence (confirmed by urine testing) with points or vouchers which patients can exchange for such things as an evening out or membership in a gym. Cognitive-behav- ioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and avoid situations most likely to lead to cocaine use and to devel- op healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Resi- dential programs/therapeutic communities may also be helpful, particularly in more severe cases. Patients typi- cally spend six to 12 months in such programs, which may also include vocational training and other features. KEY TERMS Apoxia\u2014Apoxia refers to altitude sickness.

The brain is the center of higher processes, such as thought and emotion and is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of informa- tion from the senses.

Neurotransmitter \u2014A chemical that carries nerve impulses across a synapse. Synapse\u2014The gap between two nerve cells. Alternative treatment Various alternative or complementary approaches have been used in treating cocaine addiction, often in combination with more conventional therapies. In Japan, the herb acorus has been traditionally used both to assist early-stage cocaine withdrawal and in later recovery stages. Other herbs sometimes used to treat drug addic- tions of various kinds include kola nut, guarana seed and yohimbe (to boost short-term energy), and valerian root, hops leaf, scullcap leaf, and chamomile (to calm the patient). The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine have been used to reduce cocaine addicts\u2019 craving for the drug, and vitamin therapy may be used to help strengthen the patient. Gentle massage has been used to help infants born with congenital cocaine addiction. Other tech- niques, such as acupuncture , EEG biofeedback , and visualization, may also be useful in treating addiction. Prognosis Because addiction involves so many different factors, prospects for individual addicts vary widely. However, research has consistently shown that treatment can signifi- cantly reduce both drug abuse and subsequent criminal activity. The comprehensive Services Research Outcomes Study (1998) found a 45% drop in cocaine use five years after treatment, compared to use during the five years before treatment. The study also found that females generally respond better to treatment than males, and older patients tend to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.

Peter Gregutt Coccidioidomycosis Definition Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhal- ing the microscopic spores of the fungus Coccidioides immitis. Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that fungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists in three forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms. The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years after initial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed, injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi- nated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid- ioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affecting many organ systems and is often fatal. Description Coccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The fungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desert soil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen- tral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some- times called San Joaquin fever, valley fever, or desert fever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys of California. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid- ioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occur in only one out of every 100,000 people. Although anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm laborers, construction workers, and archaeologists who work where it is dusty are at greater risk to become infected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis, but the disease most commonly occurs in the 25\u201355 age group. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects men and women equally. Chronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy- cosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women. Although it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20 times more likely to develop the disseminated form of the disease than caucasians. People who have a weak- ened immune system (immunocompromised), either from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of medications that suppressed the immune system ( cor- ticosteroids, chemotherapy), are more likely to develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Causes and symptoms When the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they can become lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause localized inflammation. This is known as acute or primary coccid- ioidomycosis. The disease is not spread from one person to another. Approximately 60% of people who are infect- ed exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other 40%, symptoms appear 10\u201330 days after exposure. These symptoms include a fever which can reach 104\u00b0F (39.5\u00b0C), dry cough, chest pains, joint and muscle aches, headache , and weight loss. About two weeks after the start of the fever, some people develop a painful red rash or lumps on the lower legs. Symptoms usually disappear without treatment in about one month. People who have been infected gain partial immunity to reinfection. The chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally occurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years dur- ing which the patient experiences no symptoms of the disease.

          "content": "As many as three to four million people are estimat- ed to be chronic cocaine users. The 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported an estimated 600,000 current crack users, showing no significant change since the late 1980s. How cocaine affects the brain Extensive research has been conducted to determine how cocaine works on the brain and why it is so addictive. Cocaine has been found to affect an area of the brain known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which con- nects with the nucleus accumbens, a major pleasure cen- ter. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs, cocaine\u2019s effects are related to the action of the neuro- transmitter dopamine, which carries information between neurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioning of neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, which builds up in the synapses and is believed to cause the pleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users. Short-term effects of use The short-term effects of cocaine can include: \u2022 rapid heartbeat \u2022 constricted blood vessels \u2022 dilated pupils \u2022 increased temperature \u2022 increased energy \u2022 reduced appetite \u2022 increased sense of alertness \u2022 euphoria \u2022 death due to overdose Long-term effects of use The long-term effects of cocaine and crack use include: \u2022 dependence, addiction \u2022 irritability \u2022 mood swings \u2022 restlessness \u2022 weight loss \u2022 auditory hallucinations \u2022 paranoia Cocaine use and pregnancy The rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of crack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about its effects on the developing fetus and, since then, several research reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine use could be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn, and child development problems. According to the The Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many of these early reports had methodological flaws, and most researchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu- sions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi- dence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatal care and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac- tors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaine users. Research sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen- ter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatal care is associated with undesirable effects often attrib- uted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) however, reports that mothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five times as likely to have a baby with a malformation of the urinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus, cocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis- able, especially since it is also often associated with the use of alcohol known to cause long-term developmental problems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expecting mother so as to discourage cocaine use remains an important task for all health caregivers. Diagnosis Diagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult. Many of the signs of short-term cocaine use are not obvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs, it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drug from another. Cocaine use has been documented in significant numbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over all age groups, more men than women use the drug. The highest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to 25 years old.

Lohr, PhD Cocaine Definition Cocaine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant extracted from the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylon coca. Description In its most common form, cocaine is a whitish crys- talline powder that produces feelings of euphoria when ingested. Now classified as a Schedule II drug, cocaine has legitimate medical uses as well as a long history of recre- ational abuse. Administered by a licensed physician, the drug can be used as a local anesthetic for certain eye and ear problems and in some kinds of surgery. Forms of the drug In powder form, cocaine is known by such street names as \u201ccoke,\u201d \u201cblow,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cflake,\u201d \u201csnow\u201d and KEY TERMS Dyspnea\u2014Difficulty in breathing.

Crack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces an immediate and more intense high. It comes in off- white chunks or chips called \u201crocks.\u201d Little crumbs of crack are sometimes called \u201ckibbles & bits.\u201d In addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine and crack are often mixed with other substances. Cocaine may be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug of abuse, known as \u201ccat,\u201d that is similar to methampheta- mine) to create a \u201cwildcat.\u201d A hollowed-out cigar filled with a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a \u201cwoolah.\u201d And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc- tion with heroin is called a \u201cspeedball.\u201d Cocaine used together with alcohol represents the most common fatal two-drug combination. History Cocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive drugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used by the Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region of South America for thousands of years, both as a stimu- lant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia ( altitude sickness). Despite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not until the latter part of the nineteenth century that the active ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, was first extracted from those leaves. The new drug soon became a common ingredient in patent medicines and other popular products (including the original formula for Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con- cerns about the drug\u2019s negative effects. In the early 1900s, several legislative steps were taken to address those concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the use of cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod- ucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declined substantially. The drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed interest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s, use of the drug had once again become a national prob- lem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early 1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on the increase in certain geographic areas and among certain age groups. Causes and symptoms As with other forms of addiction , cocaine abuse is the result of a complex combination of internal and external factors. Genetic predisposition, family history, and immediate environment can all affect a person\u2019s probability of becoming addicted. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 831 Cocaine",

          "content": "Treatment Treating conduct disorder requires an approach that addresses both the child and his environment. Behavioral therapy and psychotherapy can help a child with CD to control his anger and develop new coping skills. Family group therapy may also be effective in some cases. Par- ents should be counseled on how to set appropriate limits with their child and be consistent and realistic when dis- ciplining. If an abusive home life is at the root of the con- duct problem, every effort should be made to move the child into a more supportive environment. Parent training programs are increasing in number. For children with coexisting ADHD, substance abuse, depression, or learning disorders , treating these conditions first is preferred, and may result in a signifi- cant improvement to the CD condition. In all cases of CD, treatment should begin when symptoms first appear. Recent studies have shown Ritalin to be a useful drug for both ADHD and CD. When aggressive behavior is severe, mood stabi- lizing medication, including lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs), car- bamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), and propranolol (Inderal), may be an appropriate option for treating the aggressive symptoms. However, placing the child into a structured setting or treatment program such as a psy- chiatric hospital may be just as beneficial for easing aggression as medication. Prognosis The prognosis for children with CD is not bright. Follow-up studies of conduct disordered children have shown a high incidence of antisocial personality disor- der, affective illnesses, and chronic criminal behavior later in life. However, proper treatment of co-existing disorders, early identification and intervention, and long-term support may improve the outlook signifi- cantly. KEY TERMS ADHD\u2014Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; a disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity. Major depressive disorder \u2014A mood disorder characterized by profound feelings of sadness or despair. Prevention A supportive, nurturing, and structured home envi- ronment is believed to be the best defense against CD. Children with learning disabilities and/or difficulties in school should get immediate and appropriate academic assistance. Addressing these problems when they first appear helps to prevent the frustration and low self- esteem that may lead to CD later on.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Drug overdose Definition A drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine in an amount that is higher than is normally used. Description All drugs have the potential to be misused, whether legally prescribed by a doctor, purchased over-the- counter at the local drug store, or bought illegally on the street. Taken in combination with other drugs or with alcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can cause death or serious long term consequences. Children are particularly at risk for accidental overdose, accounting for over one million poisonings each year from drugs, alcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo- ple who suffer from depression and who have suicidal thoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose. Causes and symptoms Accidental drug overdose may be the result of mis- use of prescription medicines or commonly used medica- tions like pain relievers and cold remedies. Symptoms differ depending on the drug taken. Some of the drugs commonly involved in overdoses are listed below along with symptoms and outcomes. Acetaminophen is the generic name for the com- monly used pain reliever Tylenol. Overdose of this drug causes liver damage with symptoms that include loss of appetite, tiredness, nausea and vomiting , paleness, and sweating. The next stage of symptoms indicates liver failure and includes abdominal pain and tenderness, swelling of the liver, and abnormal blood tests for liver enzymes. In the last stage of this poisoning, liver failure advances and the patient becomes jaundiced, with yel- lowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. They may also experience kidney failure, bleeding disorders, and encephalopathy (swelling of the brain). Anticholinergic drugs (drugs that block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) like atropine, scopo- lamine, belladonna, antihistamines , and antipsychotic agents cause the skin and moist tissues (like in the mouth and nose) to become dry and flushed. Dilated pupils, an inability to urinate, and mental disturbances are also symptoms. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, extremely high blood pressure, and coma. Antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi- pramine, and nortriptyline can cause irregular heart rate, vomiting, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizures. An overdose of antidepressants also causes symptoms similar to those seen with anticholinergic drug overdoses. Cholinergic drugs (drugs that stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system) like carbamate and pilocarpine cause nausea, diarrhea, increased secretion of body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, and urine), fatigue , and muscle weakness. Convulsions are possible. Death can occur due to respiratory failure and heart failure. Cocaine and crack cocaine overdoses cause seizures, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, paranoia, and other changes in behavior. Heart attack or stroke are serious risks within three days after cocaine overdose. Depressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs, sleeping pills) cause sleepiness, slowed or slurred speech, difficulty walking or standing, blurred vision, impaired ability to think, disorientation, and mood changes.

Tuteur, MD Contractures Definition Contractures are the chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in non-bony tissue. These non-bony tissues include muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Description Contractures can occur at any joint of the body. This joint dysfunction may be a result of immobilization from injury or disease; nerve injury, such as spinal cord dam- age and stroke; or muscle, tendon, or ligament disease. KEY TERMS Fallopian tubes \u2014The thin tubes that connect the ovary to the uterus. Ova (eggs) travel from the ovary to the uterus. If the egg has been fertilized, it can implant in the uterus. Fertilization \u2014The joining of the sperm and the egg; conception. Implantation\u2014The process in which the fertilized egg embeds itself in the wall of the uterus. Ovulation\u2014The release of an egg (ovum) from the ovary. Causes and symptoms There are a number of pathologies and diseases that can lead to joint contractures. The primary causes result- ing in a joint contraction are muscle imbalance, pain, prolonged bed rest, and immobilization. Because of the frequency of fractures and surgery, immobilization is the most frequent cause of joint contractures. Symptoms include a significant loss of motion to any specific joint that results in immobility. If the contracture is of a signif- icant degree, pain can result even without any voluntary joint movement. Diagnosis Manual testing of joint mobility by a healthcare pro- fessional skilled in joint mobilization techniques (e.g. a physical therapist) will identify indications of restricted structures within the joint. Measuring the motion of the joint with a device termed a \u201cgoniometer\u201d can be useful if the decrease of motion can be shown to be a proven result of a joint contracture. X rays can be of some bene- fit in the diagnosis of contractures, because a visible decrease in joint space may indicate a tight, contracted joint. Most physicians will make the diagnosis after a thorough physical examination involving physical and manual testing of the joint motion. Treatment Manual techniques Joint mobilization and stretching of soft tissues is a common technique used to increase joint elasticity. Structures are stretched in similar directions to those which take place upon normal joint motion. Some healthcare professionals may use some form of heat prior to the stretching and mobilization. If appropriate, exer- cise may follow manual techniques to help maintain the additional motion achieved. Mechanical techniques Devices known as continuous passive motion machines are very popular, especially following surgery of joints. Continuous passive motion machines (CPM) are specifically adjusted to each individual\u2019s need. This method is administered within the first 24\u201372 hours after the injury or surgery. The joint is mechanically moved through the patient\u2019s tolerable motion. CPM machines have been proved to accelerate the return motion process, allowing patients more function in less time.

          "content": "Casting or splinting Casting or splinting techniques are used to provide a constant stretch to the soft tissues surrounding a joint. It is most effective when used to increase motion of a joint from prolonged immobilization. It is also popular for treating contractures resulting from an increase in muscle tone from nerve injury. After an initial holding cast is applied for seven to 10 days, a series of positional casts are applied at weekly intervals. Before the application of each new cast, the joint is moved as much as can be toler- ated by the patient, and measured by a goniometer. When as much motion as possible is obtained after stretching, another final cast is applied to maintain the newly acquired motion. Surgery In some cases the contracture may be severe and not respond to conservative treatment. In this event, manipu- lation of the joint under a general anesthesia may be nec- essary. Alternative treatment In some areas of the body, chiropractic techniques have been found to be useful to improve motion. Mas- sage therapy can be beneficial by promoting additional circulation to joint structures, causing better elasticity. Yoga can help prevent as well as rehabilitate a contrac- ture and can facilitate the return of joint mobility. Prognosis Prognosis of contractures will depend upon the cause of the contracture. In general, the earlier the treat- ment for the contracture begins, the better the prognosis.

          "content": "drowning/suffocation, might cause CP. Likewise, inges- tion of a toxic substance such as lead, mercury, poisons, or certain chemicals could cause neurological damage. Accidental overdose of certain medications might also cause similar damage to the central nervous system. By definition, the defect in cerebral function causing CP is nonprogressive. However, the symptoms of CP often change over time. Most of the symptoms of CP relate in some way to the aberrant control of muscles. To review, CP is categorized first by the type of move- ment/postural disturbance(s) present, then by a descrip- tion of which limbs are affected, and finally by the sever- ity of motor impairment. For example, spastic diplegia refers to continuously tight muscles that have no volun- tary control in both legs, while athetoid quadraparesis describes uncontrolled writhing movements and muscle weakness in all four limbs. These three-part descriptions are helpful in providing a general picture, but cannot give a complete description of any one person with CP. In addition, the various \u201cforms\u201d of CP do not occur with equal frequency\u2014spastic diplegia is seen in more indi- viduals than is athetoid quadraparesis. CP can also be loosely categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, but these are very subjective terms with no firm boundaries between them. A muscle that is tensed and contracted is hypertonic, while excessively loose muscles are hypotonic. Spastic, hypertonic muscles can cause serious orthopedic prob- lems, including scoliosis (spine curvature), hip disloca- tion, or contractures . A contracture is shortening of a muscle, aided sometimes by a weak-opposing force from a neighboring muscle. Contractures may become perma- nent, or \u201cfixed,\u201d without some sort of intervention. Fixed contractures may cause postural abnormalities in the affected limbs. Clenched fists and contracted feet (equi- nus or equinovarus) are common in people with CP. Spasticity in the thighs causes them to turn in and cross at the knees, resulting in an unusual method of walking known as a \u201cscissors gait.\u201d Any of the joints in the limbs may be stiff (immobilized) due to spasticity of the attached muscles. Athetosis and dyskinesia often occur with spasticity, but do not often occur alone. The same is true of ataxia. It is important to remember that \u201cmild CP\u201d or \u201csevere CP\u201d refers not only to the number of symptoms present, but also to the level of involvement of any particular class of symptoms. Mechanisms that can cause CP are not always restricted to motor-control areas of the brain. Other neu- rologically based symptoms may include: \u2022 mental retardation/learning disabilities \u2022 behavioral disorders \u2022 seizure disorders \u2022 visual impairment \u2022 hearing loss \u2022 speech impairment (dysarthria) \u2022 abnormal sensation and perception These problems may have a greater impact on a child\u2019s life than the physical impairments of CP, although not all children with CP are affected by other problems. Many infants and children with CP have growth impair- ment. About one-third of individuals with CP have moder- ate-to-severe mental retardation, one-third have mild men- tal retardation, and one-third have normal intelligence. Diagnosis The signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth. Children normally progress through a predictable set of developmental milestones through the first 18 months of life. Children with CP, however, tend to develop these skills more slowly because of their motor impairments, and delays in reaching milestones are usually the first symptoms of CP. Babies with more severe cases of CP are usually diagnosed earlier than others. Selected developmental milestones, and the ages for normally acquiring them, are given below. If a child does not acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses, there is some cause for concern. \u2022 sits well unsupported\u2014six months (eight\u201310 months) \u2022 babbles\u2014six months (eight months) \u2022 crawls\u2014nine months (12 months) \u2022 finger feeds, holds bottle\u2014nine months (12 months) \u2022 walks alone\u201412 months (15\u201318 months) \u2022 uses one or two words other than dada/mama\u201412 months (15 months) \u2022 walks up and down steps\u201424 months (24\u201336 months) \u2022 turns pages in books; removes shoes and socks\u201424 months (30 months) Children do not consistently favor one hand over the other before 12\u201318 months, and doing so may be a sign that the child has difficulty using the other hand. This same preference for one side of the body may show up as asymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring one leg while climbing stairs. It must be remembered that children normally progress at somewhat different rates, and slow beginning accomplishment is often followed by normal develop- ment.

          "content": "sidering CP as the answer. CP is nonprogressive, so con- tinued loss of previously acquired milestones indicates that CP is not the cause of the problem. No one test is diagnostic for CP, but certain factors increase suspicion. The Apgar score measures a baby\u2019s condition immediately after birth. Babies that have low Apgar scores are at increased risk for CP. Presence of abnormal muscle tone or movements may indicate CP, as may the persistence of infantile reflexes. Imaging of the brain using ultrasound, x rays, MRI, and/or CT scans may reveal a structural anomaly. Some brain lesions associated with CP include scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebral ventricles (hydrocephalus), periventricular leukomalacia (an abnormality of the area surrounding the ventricles), areas of dead tissue (necrosis), and evidence of an intra- cerebral hemorrhage or blood clot. Blood and urine bio- chemical tests, as well as genetic tests, may be used to rule out other possible causes, including muscle and peripheral nerve diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases, and other inherited disorders. Evaluations by a pediatric devel- opmental specialist and a geneticist may be of benefit. Treatment Cerebral palsy cannot be cured, but many of the dis- abilities it causes can be managed through planning and timely care. Treatment for a child with CP depends on the severity, nature, and location of the primary muscular symp- toms, as well as any associated problems that might be pre- sent. Optimal care of a child with mild CP may involve reg- ular interaction with only a physical therapist and occupa- tional therapist, whereas care for a more severely affected child may include visits to multiple medical specialists throughout life. With proper treatment and an effective plan, most people with CP can lead productive, happy lives. Therapy Spasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia, and scoliosis are all significant impairments that affect the posture and mobility of a person with CP. Physical and occupational therapists work with the patient, and the fam- ily, to maximize the ability to move affected limbs, devel- op normal motor patterns, and maintain posture. \u201cAssistive technology,\u201d things such as wheelchairs, walkers, shoe inserts, crutches, and braces, are often required. A speech therapist, and high-tech aids such as computer-controlled communication devices, can make a tremendous differ- ence in the life of those who have speech impairments. Medications Before fixed contractures develop, muscle-relaxant drugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene (Dantri- um), and baclofen (Lioresal) may be prescribed. Botu- linum toxin (Botox), a newer and highly effective treat- ment, is injected directly into the affected muscles. Alco- hol or phenol injections into the nerve controlling the muscle are another option. Multiple medications are available to control seizures, and athetosis can be treated using medications such as trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). Surgery Fixed contractures are usually treated with either serial casting or surgery. The most commonly used surgi- cal procedures are tenotomy, tendon transfer, and dorsal rhizotomy. In tenotomy, tendons of the affected muscle are cut and the limb is cast in a more normal position while the tendon regrows. Alternatively, tendon transfer involves cutting and reattaching a tendon at a different point on the bone to enhance the length and function of the muscle. A neurosurgeon performing dorsal rhizotomy carefully cuts selected nerve roots in the spinal cord to prevent them from stimulating the spastic muscles. Neu- rosurgical techniques in the brain such as implanting tiny electrodes directly into the cerebellum, or cutting a por- tion of the hypothalamus, have very specific uses and have had mixed results. Education Parents of a child newly diagnosed with CP are not likely to have the necessary expertise to coordinate the full range of care their child will need. Although knowledgeable and caring medical professionals are indispensable for developing a care plan, a potentially more important source of information and advice is other parents who have dealt with the same set of diffi- culties. Support groups for parents of children with CP can be significant sources of both practical advice and emotional support. Many cities have support groups that can be located through the United Cerebral Palsy Association, and most large medical centers have spe- cial multidisciplinary clinics for children with develop- mental disorders. Prognosis Cerebral palsy can affect every stage of maturation, from childhood through adolescence to adulthood. At each stage, those with CP, along with their caregivers, must strive to achieve and maintain the fullest range of experiences and education consistent with their abilities. The advice and intervention of various professionals remains crucial for many people with CP. Although CP itself is not considered a terminal disorder, it can affect a person\u2019s lifespan by increasing the risk for certain med- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 705 Cerebral palsy",

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS.

          "content": "Casting or splinting Casting or splinting techniques are used to provide a constant stretch to the soft tissues surrounding a joint. It is most effective when used to increase motion of a joint from prolonged immobilization. It is also popular for treating contractures resulting from an increase in muscle tone from nerve injury. After an initial holding cast is applied for seven to 10 days, a series of positional casts are applied at weekly intervals. Before the application of each new cast, the joint is moved as much as can be toler- ated by the patient, and measured by a goniometer. When as much motion as possible is obtained after stretching, another final cast is applied to maintain the newly acquired motion. Surgery In some cases the contracture may be severe and not respond to conservative treatment. In this event, manipu- lation of the joint under a general anesthesia may be nec- essary. Alternative treatment In some areas of the body, chiropractic techniques have been found to be useful to improve motion. Mas- sage therapy can be beneficial by promoting additional circulation to joint structures, causing better elasticity. Yoga can help prevent as well as rehabilitate a contrac- ture and can facilitate the return of joint mobility. Prognosis Prognosis of contractures will depend upon the cause of the contracture.

Tuteur, MD Contractures Definition Contractures are the chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in non-bony tissue. These non-bony tissues include muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Description Contractures can occur at any joint of the body. This joint dysfunction may be a result of immobilization from injury or disease; nerve injury, such as spinal cord dam- age and stroke; or muscle, tendon, or ligament disease. KEY TERMS Fallopian tubes \u2014The thin tubes that connect the ovary to the uterus. Ova (eggs) travel from the ovary to the uterus. If the egg has been fertilized, it can implant in the uterus. Fertilization \u2014The joining of the sperm and the egg; conception. Implantation\u2014The process in which the fertilized egg embeds itself in the wall of the uterus. Ovulation\u2014The release of an egg (ovum) from the ovary. Causes and symptoms There are a number of pathologies and diseases that can lead to joint contractures. The primary causes result- ing in a joint contraction are muscle imbalance, pain, prolonged bed rest, and immobilization. Because of the frequency of fractures and surgery, immobilization is the most frequent cause of joint contractures. Symptoms include a significant loss of motion to any specific joint that results in immobility. If the contracture is of a signif- icant degree, pain can result even without any voluntary joint movement. Diagnosis Manual testing of joint mobility by a healthcare pro- fessional skilled in joint mobilization techniques (e.g. a physical therapist) will identify indications of restricted structures within the joint. Measuring the motion of the joint with a device termed a \u201cgoniometer\u201d can be useful if the decrease of motion can be shown to be a proven result of a joint contracture. X rays can be of some bene- fit in the diagnosis of contractures, because a visible decrease in joint space may indicate a tight, contracted joint. Most physicians will make the diagnosis after a thorough physical examination involving physical and manual testing of the joint motion. Treatment Manual techniques Joint mobilization and stretching of soft tissues is a common technique used to increase joint elasticity. Structures are stretched in similar directions to those which take place upon normal joint motion. Some healthcare professionals may use some form of heat prior to the stretching and mobilization. If appropriate, exer- cise may follow manual techniques to help maintain the additional motion achieved. Mechanical techniques Devices known as continuous passive motion machines are very popular, especially following surgery of joints. Continuous passive motion machines (CPM) are specifically adjusted to each individual\u2019s need. This method is administered within the first 24\u201372 hours after the injury or surgery. The joint is mechanically moved through the patient\u2019s tolerable motion. CPM machines have been proved to accelerate the return motion process, allowing patients more function in less time.

Serious physical trauma to the mother during preg- nancy could result in direct trauma to the fetus as well, or injuries to the mother could compromise the availability of nutrients and oxygen to the developing fetal brain. Perinatal causes Birth asphyxia significant enough to result in CP is now uncommon in developed countries. Tight nuchal cord (umbilical cord around the baby\u2019s neck) and pro- lapsed cord (cord delivered before the baby) are possible causes of birth asphyxia, as are bleeding and other com- plications associated with placental abruption and pla- centa previa (placenta lying over the cervix). Infection in the mother is sometimes not passed to the fetus through the placenta, but is transmitted to the baby during delivery. Any such infection that results in serious illness in the newborn has the potential to pro- duce some neurological damage. Postnatal causes The remaining 15% of CP is due to neurologic injury sustained after birth. CP that has a postnatal cause KEY TERMS Asphyxia\u2014Lack of oxygen.

Incompatibility between the Rh blood types of mother and child (mother Rh negative, baby Rh positive) can result in severe anemia in the baby (erythroblastosis fetalis). This may lead to other complications, including severe jaundice, which can cause CP. Rh disease in the newborn is now rare in developed countries due to rou- tine screening of maternal blood type and treatment of pregnancies at risk. The routine, effective treatment of jaundice due to other causes has also made it an infre- quent cause of CP in developed countries. Rh blood type poses a risk for recurrence of Rh disease if treatment is not provided. Serious infections that affect the brain directly, such as meningitis and encephalitis , may cause irreversible damage to the brain, leading to CP. A seizure disorder early in life may cause CP, or may be the product of a hidden problem that causes CP in addition to seizures. Unexplained (idiopathic) seizures are hereditary in only a small percentage of cases.

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurally mediated hypotension , causes a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person has been standing, exercising or exposed to heat for a while.

Accidental overdose of certain medications might also cause similar damage to the central nervous system. By definition, the defect in cerebral function causing CP is nonprogressive. However, the symptoms of CP often change over time. Most of the symptoms of CP relate in some way to the aberrant control of muscles. To review, CP is categorized first by the type of move- ment/postural disturbance(s) present, then by a descrip- tion of which limbs are affected, and finally by the sever- ity of motor impairment. For example, spastic diplegia refers to continuously tight muscles that have no volun- tary control in both legs, while athetoid quadraparesis describes uncontrolled writhing movements and muscle weakness in all four limbs. These three-part descriptions are helpful in providing a general picture, but cannot give a complete description of any one person with CP. In addition, the various \u201cforms\u201d of CP do not occur with equal frequency\u2014spastic diplegia is seen in more indi- viduals than is athetoid quadraparesis. CP can also be loosely categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, but these are very subjective terms with no firm boundaries between them. A muscle that is tensed and contracted is hypertonic, while excessively loose muscles are hypotonic. Spastic, hypertonic muscles can cause serious orthopedic prob- lems, including scoliosis (spine curvature), hip disloca- tion, or contractures . A contracture is shortening of a muscle, aided sometimes by a weak-opposing force from a neighboring muscle. Contractures may become perma- nent, or \u201cfixed,\u201d without some sort of intervention. Fixed contractures may cause postural abnormalities in the affected limbs. Clenched fists and contracted feet (equi- nus or equinovarus) are common in people with CP. Spasticity in the thighs causes them to turn in and cross at the knees, resulting in an unusual method of walking known as a \u201cscissors gait.\u201d Any of the joints in the limbs may be stiff (immobilized) due to spasticity of the attached muscles. Athetosis and dyskinesia often occur with spasticity, but do not often occur alone. The same is true of ataxia. It is important to remember that \u201cmild CP\u201d or \u201csevere CP\u201d refers not only to the number of symptoms present, but also to the level of involvement of any particular class of symptoms. Mechanisms that can cause CP are not always restricted to motor-control areas of the brain. Other neu- rologically based symptoms may include: \u2022 mental retardation/learning disabilities \u2022 behavioral disorders \u2022 seizure disorders \u2022 visual impairment \u2022 hearing loss \u2022 speech impairment (dysarthria) \u2022 abnormal sensation and perception These problems may have a greater impact on a child\u2019s life than the physical impairments of CP, although not all children with CP are affected by other problems. Many infants and children with CP have growth impair- ment. About one-third of individuals with CP have moder- ate-to-severe mental retardation, one-third have mild men- tal retardation, and one-third have normal intelligence. Diagnosis The signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth. Children normally progress through a predictable set of developmental milestones through the first 18 months of life. Children with CP, however, tend to develop these skills more slowly because of their motor impairments, and delays in reaching milestones are usually the first symptoms of CP. Babies with more severe cases of CP are usually diagnosed earlier than others. Selected developmental milestones, and the ages for normally acquiring them, are given below. If a child does not acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses, there is some cause for concern. \u2022 sits well unsupported\u2014six months (eight\u201310 months) \u2022 babbles\u2014six months (eight months) \u2022 crawls\u2014nine months (12 months) \u2022 finger feeds, holds bottle\u2014nine months (12 months) \u2022 walks alone\u201412 months (15\u201318 months) \u2022 uses one or two words other than dada/mama\u201412 months (15 months) \u2022 walks up and down steps\u201424 months (24\u201336 months) \u2022 turns pages in books; removes shoes and socks\u201424 months (30 months) Children do not consistently favor one hand over the other before 12\u201318 months, and doing so may be a sign that the child has difficulty using the other hand. This same preference for one side of the body may show up as asymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring one leg while climbing stairs.

          "content": "Other symptoms A small percentage of boys with FMF develop painful inflammation around the testes, headaches are a common occurrence during attacks, and certain types of vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) seem to be more common in FMF. Diagnosis Individually, the symptoms that define FMF are com- mon. Fevers occur for many reasons, and nonspecific pains in the abdomen, chest, and joints are also frequent ailments. Several infections can result in symptoms simi- lar to FMF (Mallaret meningitis, for instance), and many people with FMF undergo exploratory abdominal surgery and ineffective treatments before they are finally diag- nosed. Membership in a less commonly affected ethnic group may delay or hinder the correct diagnosis. In general, symptoms involving one or more of the following broad groups should lead to suspicion of FMF: Unexplained recurrent fevers, polyserositis, skin rash, and/or joint pain; abnormal blood studies (see below); and renal or other disease associated with amyloidosis. A family history of FMF or its symptoms would obviously be an important clue, but the recessive nature of FMF means there usually is no family history. The diagnosis may be confirmed when a person with unexplained fever and pain responds to treatment with colchicine since colchicine is not known to have a beneficial effect on any other condition similar to FMF. Abnormal results on a blood test typically include leukocytosis (elevated num- ber of neutrophils in the blood), an increased erythro- cyte sedimentation rate (rate at which red blood cells form a sediment in a blood sample), and increased levels of proteins associated with inflammation (called acute phase reactants) such as SAA. Direct analysis of the MEFV gene for FMF muta- tions is the only method to be certain of the diagnosis. However, it is not yet possible to detect all MEFV gene mutations that might cause FMF. Thus, if DNA analysis is negative, clinical methods must be relied upon. If both members of a couple were proven to be FMF carriers through genetic testing, highly accurate prenatal diagno- sis would be available in any subsequent pregnancy. Similar syndromes of periodic fever and inflamma- tion include familial Hibernian fever and hyperim- munoglobulinemia D syndrome, but both are more rare than FMF. Treatment Colchicine is a chemical compound that can be used as a medication, and is frequently prescribed for gout. Some years ago, colchicine was discovered to also be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of attacks in FMF. Treatment for FMF at this point consists of taking colchicine daily. Studies have shown that about 75% of FMF patients achieve complete remission of their symptoms, and about 95% show marked improve- ment when taking colchicine. Lower effectiveness has been reported, but there is some question about the num- ber of FMF patients who choose not to take their colchicine between attacks when they are feeling well, and thus lose some of the ability to prevent attacks. Com- pliance with taking colchicine every day may be ham- pered by its side effects, which include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal bloating, and gas. There is a theoretical risk that colchicine use could damage chromosomes in sperms and eggs, or in an embryo during pregnancy, or that it might reduce fertility. However, studies looking at reproduction in men and women who have used colchicine have so far not shown any increased risks. Colchicine is also effective in preventing, delaying, or reversing renal disease associated with amyloidosis. Other medications may be used as needed to deal with the pain and fever associated with FMF attacks. Dialysis and/or renal transplant might become necessary in someone with advanced kidney disease. Given its genetic nature, there is no cure for FMF, nor is there likely to be in the near future. Any couple that has a child diag- nosed with FMF, or anyone with a family history of the condition (especially those in high-risk ethnic groups), should be offered genetic counseling to obtain the most up-to-date information on FMF and testing options. Prognosis For those individuals who are diagnosed early enough and take colchicine consistently, the prognosis is excellent. Most will have very few, if any, attacks of fever and polyserositis, and will likely not develop seri- ous complications of amyloidosis. The problem of misdi- agnosing FMF continues, but education attempts directed at both the public and medical care providers should improve the situation. Future research should provide a better understanding of the inflammation process, focus- ing on how neutrophils are genetically regulated. That information could then be used to develop treatments for FMF with fewer side effects, and might also assist in developing therapies for other diseases in which abnor- mal inflammation and immune response are a problem.

          "content": "causing painful inflammation and fever. These episodes may be accompanied by a skin rash or joint pain. In a few cases, chronic arthritis is a problem. Amyloidosis is a potentially serious condition in which proteins called amyloids are mistakenly pro- duced and deposited in organs and tissues throughout the body. Left untreated, amyloidosis often leads to kidney failure, which is the major long-term health risk in FMF. In most cases, the attacks of fever and pain are first noticed in childhood or adolescence. The interval between these episodes may be days or months, and is not predictable. However, during these intervals people with FMF typically lead normal lives. It is not entirely clear what brings on an attack, but people with FMF often report mild physical trauma, physical exertion, or emotional stress just prior to the onset of symptoms. Treatment for FMF involves an oral medication called colchicine, which is highly effective for the episodes of fever and pain, as well as for amyloidosis and the kidney disease that can result from it. FMF is most common in certain ethnic groups from the eastern Mediterranean region, but cases in other eth- nic groups in other parts of the world are increasingly being reported. FMF is also known by many other names. They include: recurrent hereditary polyserositis, benign paroxysmal peritonitis, familial paroxysmal pol- yserositis, paroxysmal polyserositis, familial recurrent polyserositis, periodic fever, periodic amyloid syndrome, periodic peritonitis syndrome, Reimann periodic disease, Reimann syndrome, Siegel-Cattan-Mamou syndrome, and Armenian syndrome. Estimates of the incidence of FMF in specific east- ern Mediterranean populations range from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 100, depending on the population studied. Specific mutations in the MEFV gene are more common in cer- tain ethnic groups, and may cause a somewhat different course of the disease. A few mutations in the MEFV gene likely became common in a small population in the eastern Mediterranean several thousand years ago. It is postulated that carrying a single copy of a mutated gene produced a modified (but not abnormal) inflammatory response that may have been protective against some infectious agent at that time. Those who carried a single \u201cbeneficial\u201d mutation in the MEFV gene were more like- ly to survive and reproduce, which may explain the high carrier frequency (up to one in five) in some populations. People of Armenian, Sephardic-Jewish, Arabic, and Turkish ancestry are at greatest risk for FMF. However, a better understanding and recognition of the symptoms of FMF in recent years has resulted in more reports of the condition in other ethnic groups, such as Italians and Armenian-Americans. Causes and symptoms FMF is a genetic condition inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Mutations in the MEFV gene (short for Mediterranean Fever) on chromosome number 16 are the underlying cause of FMF. Autosomal recessive inher- itance implies that a person with FMF has mutations in both copies of the MEFV gene. All genes come in pairs, and one copy of each pair is inherited from each parent. If neither parent of a child with FMF has the condition, it means they carry one mutated copy of the MEFV gene, but also one normal copy, which is enough to protect them from disease. If both parents carry the same autoso- mal recessive gene, there is a one in four chance in each pregnancy that the child will inherit both recessive genes, and thus have the condition. The MEFV gene carries the instructions for produc- tion of a protein called pyrin, named for pyrexia, a med- ical term for fever. The research group in France that co- discovered the protein named it marenostrin, after ancient Latin words that referred to the Mediterranean Sea. The movement of neutrophils into an area of the body where trauma or infection has occurred is the major cause of inflammation, which is a normal process. Research has shown that pyrin has some function in controlling neu- trophils. In a situation where minor trauma or stress occurs, some initial inflammation may follow, but a func- tional pyrin protein is responsible for shutting-down the response of neutrophils once they are no longer needed. An abnormal pyrin protein associated with FMF may be partly functional, but unstable. In some instances, the abnormal pyrin itself seems to be \u201cstressed\u201d, and loses its ability to regulate neutrophils and inflammation. Left unregulated, a normal, mild inflammation spirals out of control. Exactly what causes pyrin in FMF to lose its abil- ity to control neutrophils in some situations is not known. The recurrent acute attacks of FMF typically begin in childhood or adolescence. Episodes of fever and painful inflammation usually last 12\u201372 hours. About 90% of people with FMF have their first attack by age 20. The group of symptoms that characterizes FMF includes the following: Fever An FMF attack is nearly always accompanied by a fever, but it may not be noticed in every case. Fevers are typically 100\u2013104\u00b0F (38\u201340\u00b0C). Some people experi- ence chills prior to the onset of fever.

About 10% of patients will wind up without a definite cause, and about the same percentage have \u201cfactitious fevers\u201d (either self induced or no fever at all). Some general symptoms tend to occur along with fever; these are called constitutional symptoms and con- sist of myalgias (muscle aches), chills, and headache. Diagnosis Few symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos- tic challenge as fever. Nonetheless, if a careful, logical, and thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will be found in most cases. The patient\u2019s past medical history as well as travel, social, and family history should be care- fully searched for important clues. Usually the first step is to search for an infectious cause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such as tuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool, are generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number of infectious agents can be measured; if these are rising, they may point to an active infection. Various x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to standard examinations, recently developed radiological techniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scans are now available. These enable physicians to examine areas that were once accessible only through surgery. Fur- thermore, new studies using radioactive materials (nuclear medicine), can detect areas of infection and inflammation previously almost impossible to find, even with surgery. Biopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray exam can be performed by either traditional or newer surgical techniques. Material obtained by biopsy is then examined by a pathologist to look for clues as to the cause of the fever. Evidence of infection, tumor or other diseases can be found in this way. Portions of the biopsy are also sent to the laboratory for culture in an attempt to grow and identify an infectious organism. Patients with HIV are an especially difficult prob- lem, as they often suffer from many unusual infections. HIV itself is a potential cause of fever. Treatment Most patients who undergo evaluation for FUO do not receive treatment until a clear-cut cause is found. Antibi- otics or medications designed to suppress a fever (such as NSAIDs) will only hide the true cause. Once physicians are satisfied that there is no infectious cause, they may use med- ications such as NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to decrease inflammation and diminish constitutional symptoms. The development of FUO in certain settings, such as that acquired by patients in the hospital or in those with a low white blood count , often needs rapid treatment to avoid serious complications. Therefore, in these instances patients may be placed on antibiotics after a minimal number of diagnostic studies. Once test results are known, treatment can be adjusted as needed. Prognosis The outlook for patients with FUO depends on the cause of the fever. If the basic illness is easily treatable and can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cure is quite good. Some patients continue with temperature elevations for six months or more; if no serious disease is found, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decrease the effects of the fever. Careful follow-up and reevalua- tion is recommended in these cases. Resources BOOKS Gelfand, Jeffrey A., and Charles A.

It can mimic appendicitis , and many people with undiagnosed FMF have had appendectomies or exploratory surgery of the abdomen done, only to have the fever and abdominal pain return. Chest pain Pleuritis, also called pleurisy, occurs in up to half of the affected individuals in certain ethnic groups. The pain is usually on one side of the chest. Pericarditis would also be felt as chest pain. Joint pain About 50% of people with FMF experience joint pain during attacks. The pain is usually confined to one joint at a time, and often involves the hip, knee, or ankle. For some people, however, the recurrent joint pain becomes chronic arthritis. Myalgia Up to 20% of individuals report muscle pain. These episodes typically last less than two days, and tend to occur in the evening or after physical exertion. Rare cases of muscle pain and fever lasting up to one month have been reported. KEY TERMS Acute phase reactants\u2014Blood proteins whose con- centrations increase or decrease in reaction to the inflammation process. Amyloid\u2014A waxy translucent substance composed mostly of protein, that forms plaques (abnormal deposits) in the brain. Amyloidosis\u2014Accumulation of amyloid deposits in various organs and tissues in the body such that normal functioning of an organ is compromised. Colchicine\u2014A compound that blocks the assembly of microtubules\u2013protein fibers necessary for cell division and some kinds of cell movements, includ- ing neutrophil migration. Side effects may include diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and gas. Leukocyte\u2014A white blood cell. The neutrophils are a type of leukocyte. Leukocytosis\u2014An increase in the number of leuko- cytes in the blood. Neutrophil \u2014The primary type of white blood cell involved in inflammation. Neutrophils are a type of granulocyte, also known as a polymorphonuclear leukocyte. Pericarditis\u2014Inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane surrounding the heart. Peritonitis \u2014Inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane surrounding the abdominal contents. Pleuritis \u2014Inflammation of the pleura, the mem- brane surrounding the lungs. Pyrexia\u2014A medical term denoting fevers. Serositis \u2014Inflammation of a serosal membrane. Polyserositis refers to the inflammation of two or more serosal membranes. Synovitis\u2014Inflammation of the synovium, a mem- brane found inside joints. Skin rash A rash, described as erysipelas-like erythema, accompanies attacks in a minority of people, and most often occurs on the front of the lower leg or top of the foot. The rash appears as a red, warm, swollen area about 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) in diameter. Amyloidosis FMF is associated with high levels in the blood of a protein called serum amyloid A (SAA). Over time, excess SAA tends to be deposited in tissues and organs throughout the body. The presence and deposition of excess SAA is known as amyloidosis. Amyloidosis may affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, heart, and testes, but effects on the kidneys are of greatest concern. The frequency of amyloidosis varies among the different ethnic groups, and its overall inci- dence is difficult to determine because of the use of colchicine to avert the problem. Left untreated, howev- er, those individuals who do develop amyloidosis of the kidneys may require a renal transplant, or may even die of renal failure. The frequency and severity of a person\u2019s attacks of fever and serositis seem to have no relation to whether they will develop amyloidosis. In fact, a few people with FMF have been described who have had amyloidosis but apparently no other FMF- related symptoms. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1283 Familial Mediterranean fever",

An important aspect of treatment with flower remedies, is that if you feel instinc- tively that you need a particular remedy, you are encour- aged to act on that instinct. However, it is advisable not to continue a particular remedy once you feel you no longer need it, and to try a different one if you feel that progress is not being made. The remedies are administered from a stoppered bottle and need to be diluted. Individuals sensitive to alcohol can apply the concentrate directly to temples, wrists, behind the ears, or underarms. They should be kept in a cool dark place; like this they should last indef- initely. However, a diluted remedy should not be kept longer than three weeks. Two drops of each diluted rem- edy should be taken four times a day, including first thing in the morning and last thing at night. If the rescue remedy is being used, four drops should be used instead. Most therapists recommend that they be taken in spring water, but the remedy can be taken directly from the bot- tle, if care is taken that the dropper does not touch the tongue, as this would introduce bacteria that would spoil the remedy. It is not recommended that more than six or seven Bach remedies be used at any one time. Instead, it is preferable to divide a larger amount up into two lots to ensure the optimum effectiveness of the remedies. No combination, or amount of combinations of the remedies can cause any harm, rather they become less effective. Unlike FES, the Bach Centre does not encourage research to \u201cprove\u201d that the remedies work, preferring that people find out for themselves. They strive to keep the use of the Bach remedies as simple as possible, and to this end they do not keep case records. Bach warned before he died that others would try to change his work and make it more complicated. He was determined to keep it simple so that anyone could use it, and that is why he limited the system to only 38 remedies. The Centre points out that many who have used Bach\u2019s research as a starting point have added other remedies to the list, even some that Bach himself rejected. Side effects Flower remedies or essences are generally regarded as being totally safe, and there are no known side effects apart from the rare appearance of a slight rash, which is not a rea- son to discontinue treatment, says the Bach Centre.

          "content": "Emotional and social health Children take their first significant steps toward socialization and peer interaction when they begin to engage in cooperative play at around age four. Their social development will progress throughout childhood and adolescence as they develop friendships, start to be influenced by their peers, and begin to show interest in the opposite sex. Factors which can have a negative impact on the emotional and social well-being of children include: \u2022 Violence. Bullying can cause serious damage to a child\u2019s sense of self-esteem and personal safety, as can experiences with school violence. \u2022 Family turmoil. Divorce, death, and other life-chang- ing events that alter the family dynamic can have a seri- ous impact on a child. Even a positive event such as the birth of a sibling or a move to a new city and school can put emotional strain on a child. \u2022 Stress. The pressure to perform well academically and in extracurricular activities such as sports can be over- whelming to some children. \u2022 Peer pressure. Although it can have a positive impact, peer pressure is often a source of significant stress for children. This is particularly true in adolescence when \u201cfitting in\u201d seems all-important. \u2022 Drugs and alcohol. Curiosity is intrinsic to childhood, and over 30% of children have experimented with alco- hol by age 13. Open communication with children that sets forth parental expectations about drug and alcohol use is essential. \u2022 Negative sexual experiences. Sexual abuse and assault can emotionally scar a child and instill negative feel- ings about sexuality and relationships. Causes and symptoms Childhood health problems may be congenital (i.e., present at birth) or acquired through infection, immune system deficiency, or another disease process. They may also be caused by physical trauma (e.g., a car accident or a playground fall) or a toxic substance (e.g., an allergen, drug, or poisonous chemical), or triggered by genetic or environmental factors. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 763 Children\u2019s health DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK (1903\u20131998) Benjamin Spock, pediatrician and political activist, was most noted for his authorship of Baby and Child Care, which significantly changed predominant attitudes toward the raising of infants and children. He began med- ical school at Yale University in 1925, and transferred to Columbia University\u2019s College of Physicians and Sur- geons in 1927. Spock had decided well before starting his medical studies that he would \u201cwork with children, who have their whole lives ahead of them\u201d and so, upon tak- ing his M.D. degree in 1929 and serving his general internship at the prestigious Presbyterian Hospital, he specialized in pediatrics at a small hospital crowded with children in New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen area. On a summer vacation in 1943 he began to write his most famous book and he continued to work on it from 1944 to 1946 while serving as a medical officer in the Navy. The book sharply broke with the authoritarian tone and rigorous instructions found in earlier generations of baby-care books, most of which said to feed infants on a strict schedule and not to pick them up when they cried. Spock, who spent ten years trying to reconcile his psycho- analytic training with what mothers were telling him about their children, told his readers \u201cY ou know more than you think you do. Don\u2019t be afraid to trust your own common sense. Take it easy, trust your own instincts, and follow the directions that your doctor gives you.\u201d The response was overwhelming. Baby and Child Care rapidly became America\u2019s all-time best-seller except for Shakespeare and the Bible; by 1976 it had also eclipsed Shakespeare. (Library of Congress.)",

The patient will also have a pre-operative physical exam- ination. In addition, patients start a course of antibiotic eye drops or ointment the day before surgery. Aftercare Proper post-operative care is especially important after cataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive them home after the surgery and should not bend over or do any- thing strenuous for about two weeks. They should refrain from rubbing the eye, should wear glasses to protect their eye, and should wear a shield while sleeping so the eye won\u2019t be rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient will usually continue their antibiotic for two to three weeks and will also take anti-inflammatory medication for about the same length of time. If the patient experiences inflamma- tion, redness, or pain, they should seek immediate medical treatment to avoid serious complications. Risks Cataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the time, there are no complications. Possible complications include intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central retinal inflammation (macular edema), post-operative glaucoma, retinal detachment, bleeding under the reti- na (choroidal hemorrhage), and tiny lens fragments in the back (vitreous) cavity of the eye, all of which can lead to loss of sight. Normal results Ordinarily, patients experience improved visual acu- ity and improved perception of the vividness of colors, leading to increased abilities in many activities, including reading, needlework, driving, golf, and tennis, for exam- ple.

          "content": "Treatment Choriocarcinomas are usually treated by surgical removal of the tumor and chemotherapy . Radiation is occasionally used, particularly for tumors in the brain. Alternative treatment Complementary treatments can decrease stress, reduce the side effects of cancer treatment, and help patients feel more in control. For instance, some people find activities such as yoga, massage, music therapy , meditation, prayer, or mild physical exercise helpful. Prognosis The prognosis for choriocarcinomas in the uterus is very good. Although these tumors have often spread throughout the body, chemotherapy results in a cure or remission in at least 80\u201390% of cases. Women who have had choriocarcinomas often go on to have normal preg- nancies and deliveries. Choriocarcinomas in other sites have a poorer prog- nosis. These tumors tend to spread quickly and don\u2019t always respond well to chemotherapy. Although treat- ment can be effective, the outcome usually depends on how widely the cancer is dispersed. Generally, the prog- nosis is worse if the cancer can be found in the liver or brain, if hCG levels are high, or if the original tumor developed outside the gonads. Five-year survival with testicular cancers can range from 92% for tumors that have spread only to the lungs to 48% to tumors that have spread to other internal organs. Prevention There is no known means of prevention. However, early detection of the symptoms and prompt medical treatment can improve the odds of survival.

Urine tests can also detect ketones and protein in the urine that may help diagnose diabetes and assess how well the kidneys are functioning. These tests can also be used to monitor the disease once the patient is on a standardized diet, oral medications, or insulin. Urine tests Clinistix and Diastix are paper strips or dipsticks that change color when dipped in urine. The test strip is compared to a chart which shows the amount of glucose in the urine based on the change in color. The level of glucose in the urine lags behind the level of glucose in the blood. Testing the urine with a test stick, paper strip, or tablet that changes color when sugar is present is not as accurate as blood testing, however it can give a fast and simple reading. Ketones in the urine can be detected using similar types of dipstick tests (Acetest or Ketostix). Ketoacidosis can be a life-threatening situation in Type I diabetics, so having a quick and simple test to detect ketones can assist in establishing a diagnosis sooner.

Glaucoma\u2014A condition where pressure within the eye causes damage to the optic nerve, which sends visual images to the brain. Hyperglycemia \u2014A condition where there is too much glucose or sugar in the blood. Hypoglycemia\u2014A condition where there is too lit- tle glucose or sugar in the blood. Insulin\u2014A hormone or chemical produced by the pancreas, insulin is needed by cells of the body in order to use glucose (sugar), the body\u2019s main source of energy. Ketoacidosis \u2014A condition due to starvation or uncontrolled Type I diabetes. Ketones are acid com- pounds that form in the blood when the body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, extreme tiredness, and drowsiness. Kidney dialysis \u2014A process where blood is filtered through a dialysis machine to remove waste prod- ucts that would normally be removed by the kid- neys. The filtered blood is then circulated back into the patient. This process is also called renal dialysis. Pancreas\u2014A gland located behind the stomach that produces insulin. indicate problems with kidney function and can be used to track the development of renal failure. A more sensitive test for urine protein uses radioactively tagged chemicals to detect microalbuminuria, small amounts of protein in the urine, that may not show up on dipstick tests. Blood tests FASTING GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is drawn from a vein in the patient\u2019s arm after a period at least eight hours when the patient has not eaten, usually in the morning before breakfast. The red blood cells are separated from the sam- ple and the amount of glucose is measured in the remain- ing plasma. A plasma level of 7.8 mmol/L (200 mg/L) or greater can indicate diabetes. The fasting glucose test is usually repeated on another day to confirm the results. POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE TEST. Blood is taken right after the patient has eaten a meal. ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. Blood samples are taken from a vein before and after a patient drinks a thick, sweet syrup of glucose and other sugars. In a non-diabet- ic, the level of glucose in the blood goes up immediately after the drink and then decreases gradually as insulin is used by the body to metabolize, or absorb, the sugar. In a diabetic, the glucose in the blood goes up and stays high after drinking the sweetened liquid. A plasma glucose level of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or higher at two hours after drinking the syrup and at one other point during the two-hour test period confirms the diagnosis of diabetes.

Performed with an optic instrument known as a cystoscope (urethroscope), this instrument uses a lighted tip for guidance to aid in diagnosing urinary tract disease and prostate disease. Performed by a urologist, this surgi- cal test also enables biopsies to be taken or small stones to be removed by way of a hollow channel in the cysto- scope. Purpose Categorized as an endoscopic procedure, cystoscopy is used by urologists to examine the entire bladder lining and take biopsies of any areas that look questionable. This test is not used on a routine basis, but may benefit the urol- ogist who is needing further information about a patient who displays the following symptoms or diagnosis: \u2022 blood in the urine (also known as hematuria) \u2022 incontinence or the inabililty to control urination \u2022 a urinary tract infection \u2022 a urinary tract which display signs of congenital abnor- malities \u2022 tumors located in the bladder \u2022 the presence of bladder or kidney stones \u2022 a stiffness or strained feeling of the urethra or ureters \u2022 symptoms of an enlarged prostate Blood and urine studies, in addition to x rays of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, may all occur before a cys- toscopy. At the time of surgery, a retrograde pyelogram may also be performed. Additional blood studies may be needed immediately following surgery. Precautions While the cystoscopy procedure is commonly relied upon to gather additional diagnostic information, it is an invasive surgical technique that may involve risks for certain patients. Those who are extremely overweight (obese), smoke, are recovering from a recent illness, or are treating a chronic condition may face additional risks from surgery. Surgical risk also increases in patients who are cur- rently using certain drugs including antihypertensives; muscle relaxants; tranquilizers; sleep inducers; insulin; sedatives; beta blockers ; or cortisone. Those who use mind-altering drugs also put themselves at increased risk of complications during surgery. The following mind-altering drugs should be avoided: narcotics; psychedelics; hallu- cinogens; marijuana; sedatives; hypnotics; or cocaine. Description Depending on the type of information needed from a cystoscopy, the procedure typically takes 10\u201340 minutes to complete. The patient will be asked to urinate before surgery which allows an accurate measurement of the remaining urine in the bladder. A well lubricated cysto- scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder where a urine sample is taken. Fluid is then pushed in to inflate the bladder and allow the urologist to examine the entire bladder wall. During an examination, the urologist may take the fol- lowing steps: remove either bladder or kidney stones; gather tissue samples; and treat any suspicious lesions. In order to perform x-ray studies (retrograde pyelogram), a harmless dye is injected into the ureters by way of a catheter that is passed through the previously placed cystoscope. After completion of all needed tests, the cystoscope is removed.

Richard Robinson Creatine phosphkinase test see Creatine kinase test Creatinine test Definition Creatine is an important compound produced by the body. It combines with phosphorus to make a high- energy phosphate compound in the body. Creatine phos- phate is used in skeletal muscle contraction. Purpose The creatinine test is used to diagnose impaired kid- ney function and to determine renal (kidney) damage. Precautions A diet high in meat content can cause transient ele- vations of serum creatinine. Some drugs that may increase creatinine values include gentamicin, cimeti- dine, heavy-metal chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cis- platin), and other drugs toxic to the kidneys, such as the cephalosporins. Description The creatinine test is used to measure the amount of creatinine in the blood.

All of the muscles under voluntary control are skeletal muscles. Smooth muscles \u2014Muscles that surround the lin- ings of the digestive system, airways, and circula- tory system. skeletal muscle contraction, the daily production of crea- tine, and the following product, creatinine, depends on muscle mass, which fluctuates very little. Creatinine is excreted entirely by the kidneys, and therefore is directly related to renal function. When the kidneys are functioning normally, the serum creatinine level should remain constant and normal. Slight increas- es in creatine levels can appear after meals, especially after ingestion of large quantities of meat, and some diur- nal variation may occur, with a low point at 7 A.M. and a peak at 7 P.M. Serious renal disorders, such as glomeru- lonephritis , pyelonephritis , and urinary obstruction, will cause abnormal elevations. The creatinine level is interpreted in conjunction with another kidney function test called the Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). The serum creatinine level has much the same significance as the BUN but tends to rise later. Because of this, determinations of creatinine help to chronicle a disease process. Generally, a doubling of cre- atinine suggests a 50% reduction in kidney filtration rate. Preparation The creatinine test requires a blood sample. It is rec- ommended that the patient be fasting (nothing to eat or drink) for at least eight hours before the test. The physi- cian may also require that ascorbic acid (vitamin C), barbiturates, and diuretics be withheld for 24 hours. Risks Risks for this test are minimal, but may include slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (blood accumulating under the puncture site). Normal results Normal values can vary from laboratory to laborato- ry, but are generally in the following ranges: \u2022 Adult female: 0.5\u20131.1 mg/dL \u2022 Adult male: 0.6\u20131.2 mg/dL \u2022 Adolescent: 0.5\u20131.0 mg/dL \u2022 Child: 0.3\u20130.7 mg/dL \u2022 Infant: 0.2\u20130.4 mg/dL \u2022 Newborn: 0.3\u20131.2 mg/dL Note that variations between sources for serum crea- tinine normal ranges are greater than for other important tests. For example, due to the greater amount of muscle mass generally present, males normally demonstrate higher creatinine levels than females.

KEY TERMS Dopamine\u2014Dopamine is a precursor of epineph- rine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine\u2014Epinephrine, also called adrenaline, is a naturally occurring hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to signals from the sym- pathetic nervous system. These signals are triggered by stress, exercise, or by emotions such as fear. Ganglioneuroma \u2014A ganglioneuroma is a tumor composed of mature nerve cells. Neuroblastoma\u2014Neuroblastoma is a tumor of the adrenal glands or sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastomas can range from being relatively harmless to highly malignant. Norepinephrine \u2014Norepinephrine is a hormone secreted by certain nerve endings of the sympa- thetic nervous system, and by the medulla (center) of the adrenal glands. Its primary function is to help maintain a constant blood pressure by stimu- lating certain blood vessels to constrict when the blood pressure falls below normal. Pheochromocytoma \u2014A pheochromocytoma is a tumor that originates from the adrenal gland\u2019s chromaffin cells, causing overproduction of cate- cholamines, powerful hormones that induce high blood pressure and other symptoms. Reference ranges for blood catecholamines Supine (lying down): Epinephrine less than 50 pg/mL, norepinephrine less than 410 pg/mL, and dopamine less than 90 pg/mL. Standing: Values for blood specimens taken when the subject is standing are higher than the ranges for supine posture for norepinephrine and epinephrine, but not for dopamine. Reference ranges for urine catecholamines Epinephrine 0\u201320 microgram per 24 hours; norepi- nephrine 15\u201380 microgram per 24 hours; dopamine 65\u2013400 microgram per 24 hours. Abnormal results Depending on the results, high catecholamine levels can indicate different conditions and/or causes: \u2022 High catecholamine levels can help to verify pheochro- mocytoma, neuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma. An aid to diagnosis is the fact that an adrenal medullary tumor (pheochromocytoma) secretes epinephrine, whereas gan- glioneuroma and neuroblastoma secrete norepinephrine. \u2022 Elevations are possible with, but do not directly confirm, thyroid disorders, low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia), or heart disease. \u2022 Electroshock therapy, or shock resulting from hemor- rhage or exposure to toxins, can raise catecholamine levels. \u2022 In the patient with normal or low baseline cate- cholamine levels, failure to show an increase in the sample taken after standing suggests an autonomic ner- vous system dysfunction (the division of the nervous system responsible for the automatic or unconscious regulation of internal body functioning).

Penicillamine, a drug that increases the solubility of cystine, may be prescribed for patients who do not respond well to other therapies. This drug must be used with caution, however, because it can cause serious side effects or allergic reactions. For those unable to take penicillamine, another drug, alpha-mercaptopropionyl- glycine (Thiola), may be prescribed. Surgical treatments Most stones can be removed from the body by nor- mal urination, helped by drinking large amounts of water. Large stones that cannot be passed this way must be removed by surgical procedures. Large stones can be surgically removed by having a device called a uretoscope placed into the urethra, up through the bladder and into the ureter, where the trapped stone can be seen and removed. Another method involves using sound-wave energy aimed from outside the body to break the large stone into small pieces that can be passed by urination. This external technique is called extracor- poreal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). For large stones in the kidney, a procedure called per- cutaneous nephrolithomy may be used. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision in the back over the kidney. An instrument called a nephroscope is inserted through the incision into the kidney. The surgeon uses the nephroscope to locate and remove the stone. If the stone is very large, it may be broken up into smaller pieces by an ultrasonic or other kind of probe before removal. Prognosis As many as 50% of patients who have had surgical treatment for a kidney stone will have another stone within five years if no medicines are used to treat this condition.

Maureen Haggerty Diabetic ketoacidosis Definition Diabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which the chemical balance of the body becomes far too acidic. Description Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a severe insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret- ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels when they become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the disease resulting from the inability of the body to produce or respond properly to insulin, required by the body to convert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKA complications represent the leading cause of death , mostly due to the accumulation of abnormally large amounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA combines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean- ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone- mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by the body; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has become too acidic. Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi- tions: the body glucose goes largely unused since most cells are unable to transport glucose into the cell without the presence of insulin; this condition makes the body use stored fat as an alternative source instead of the unavailable glucose for energy, a process that produces acidic ketones, which build up because they require insulin to be broken down. The presence of excess ketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood to become more acidic than the body tissues, which creates a toxic condition. Causes and symptoms DKA is most commonly seen in individuals with type I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usually caused by the interruption of their insulin treatment or by acute infection or trauma. A small number of people with type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, but this is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro- duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in type II patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in food intake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper- glycemia. Some common DKA symptoms include: \u2022 high blood sugar levels \u2022 frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst \u2022 fatigue and lethargy \u2022 nausea \u2022 vomiting \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 fruity odor to breath \u2022 rapid, deep breathing \u2022 muscle stiffness or aching \u2022 coma Diagnosis Diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper- glycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab- lished if the patient\u2019s urine or blood is strongly positive for glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non- diabetic person on average range from 80\u2013110 mg/dl. A person with diabetes will typically fluctuate outside those parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dl and can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon- ate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present, indicative of acidosis. A blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Test strips are available to patients commercially can sub- merge in urine to detect the presence or concentration of ketones. Treatment Ketoacidosis is treated under medical supervision and usually in a hospital setting. Basic treatment includes: \u2022 administering insulin to correct the hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1055 Diabetic ketoacidosis",

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

The treatment includes changes in diet, oral medications, and in some cases, daily injections of insulin. Description Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes serious health complications including renal (kidney) failure, heart disease, stroke, and blindness. Approxi- mately 14 million Americans (about 5% of the popula- tion) have diabetes. Unfortunately, as many as one-half are unaware that they have it. Background Every cell in the human body needs energy in order to function. The body\u2019s primary energy source is glu- cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches). Glucose from the digested food circulates in the blood as a ready energy source for any cells that need it. Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell and acts like a key to open a doorway into the cell through which glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can be converted to concentrated energy sources like glycogen or fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is not enough insulin produced or when the doorway no longer recognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the blood rather entering the cells. The body will attempt to dilute the high level of glucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia, by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood- stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it in the urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnosed diabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities of water, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get rid of the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucose in the urine. At the same time that the body is trying to get rid of glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu- cose and sending signals to the body to eat more food, thus making patients extremely hungry. To provide energy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con- vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats and proteins for energy causes acid compounds called ketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also be excreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood, a condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi- tion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading to coma and death. Types of diabetes mellitus Type I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes, begins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. In this form of diabetes, the body produces little or no insulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occurs more frequently in populations descended from Northern European countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) than in those from Southern European countries, the Middle East, or Asia. In the United States, approximately three people in 1,000 develop Type I diabetes. This form is also called insulin-dependent diabetes because people who develop this type need to have daily injections of insulin. Brittle diabetics are a subgroup of Type I where patients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugar levels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there is too much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo- glycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev- els of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients may require several injections of different types of insulin during the day to keep the blood sugar level within a fair- ly normal range. The more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs in approximately 3\u20135% of Americans under 50 years of age, and increases to 10\u201315% in those over 50. More than 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type II diabetics. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset dia- betes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in people who are overweight and who do not exercise . It is also more common in people of Native American, Hispanic, and African-American descent. People who have migrat- ed to Western cultures from East India, Japan, and Aus- tralian Aboriginal cultures are also more likely to devel- op Type II diabetes than those who remain in their origi- nal countries. Type II is considered a milder form of diabetes because of its slow onset (sometimes developing over the course of several years) and because it can usually be controlled with diet and oral medication. The conse- quences of uncontrolled and untreated Type II diabetes, however, are the just as serious as those for Type I. This form is also called noninsulin-dependent diabetes, a term that is somewhat misleading. Many people with Type II diabetes can control the condition with diet and oral medications, however, insulin injections are sometimes necessary if treatment with diet and oral medication is not working. Another form of diabetes called gestational dia- betes can develop during pregnancy and generally resolves after the baby is delivered. This diabetic condi- tion develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy in about 2% of pregnancies. The condition is usually treated by diet, however, insulin injections may GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1048 Diabetes mellitus",

          "content": "As part of the physical exam, the doctor will inspect the oral cavity or the mouth. By focusing a light into the mouth, he will look for abnormalities in color, moisture, surface texture, or presence of any thickening or sore in the lips, tongue, gums, the hard palate on the roof of the mouth, and the throat. To detect thyroid cancer, the doctor will observe the front of the neck for swelling. He may gently manipulate the neck and palpate the front and side surfaces of the thyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) to detect any nodules or tenderness. As part of the physical examination, the doctor will also palpate the lymph nodes in the neck, under the arms and in the groin. Many illnesses and cancers cause a swelling of the lymph nodes. The doctor may conduct a thorough examination of the skin to look for sores that have been present for more than three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust; irritated patches that may itch or hurt, and any change in the size of a wart or a mole. Examination of the female pelvis is used to detect cancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In the visual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal dis- charges or the presence of sores. Then, using gloved hands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organs such as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormal masses. Breast examination includes visual observation where the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness, discoloration, or scaling. The doctor palpates both breasts to feel for masses or lumps. For males, inspection of the rectum and the prostate is also included in the physical examination. The doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum and rotates it slow- ly to feel for any growths, tumors, or other abnormalities. The doctor also conducts an examination of the testes, where the doctor observes the genital area and looks for swelling or other abnormalities. The testicles are palpat- ed to identify any lumps, thickening or differences in the size, weight and firmness. If the doctor detects an abnormality on physical exam- ination, or the patient has some symptom that could be indicative of cancer, the doctor may order diagnostic tests. Laboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology), blood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that may indicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where the phlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopi- cally examined. It is often used to detect lung cancer. A blood test for cancer is easy to perform, usually inexpen- sive and risk-free. The blood sample is obtained by a lab technician or a doctor by inserting a needle into a vein and is relatively painless. Blood tests can be either spe- cific or non-specific. Often times, in certain cancers, the cancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor markers) and blood tests can be used to detect the pres- ence of these tumor markers. However, with a few excep- tions, tumor markers are not used for routine screening of cancers, because several non-cancerous conditions also produce positive results. Blood tests are generally more useful in monitoring the effectiveness of the treat- ment, or in following the course of the disease and detecting recurrent disease. Imaging tests such as computed tomography scans (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra- sound and fiberoptic scope examinations help the doctors determine the location of the tumor even if it is deep within the body. Conventional x rays are often used for initial evaluation, because they are relatively cheap, pain- less and easily accessible. In order to increase the infor- mation obtained from a conventional x ray, air or a dye (such as barium or iodine) may be used as a contrast medium to outline or highlight parts of the body. The most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy, wherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for micro- scope examination. Besides confirming a cancer, the biopsy also provides information about the type of can- cer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of the cancer and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy pro- vides the most accurate analysis, it is considered the gold standard of diagnostic tests. Screening examinations conducted regularly by healthcare professionals can result in the detection of can- cers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis, tongue, mouth, and skin at early stages, when treatment is more likely to be successful. Some of the routine screen- ing tests recommended by the ACS are sigmoidoscopy (for colorectal cancer), mammography (for breast can- cer), pap smear (for cervical cancer ), and the PSA test (for prostate cancer). Self-examinations for cancers of the breast, testes, mouth, and skin can also help in detecting the tumors before the symptoms become serious. A recent revolution in molecular biology and cancer genetics has contributed a great deal to the development of several tests designed to assess one\u2019s risk of getting cancers. These new techniques include genetic testing , where molecular probes are used to identify mutations in certain genes that have been linked to particular cancers. At present, however, there are a lot of limitations to genet- ic testing and its utility appears ambiguous, emphasizing the need to develop better strategies for early detection. Treatment The aim of cancer treatment is to remove all or as much of the tumor as possible and to prevent the recur- rence or spread of the primary tumor.

Wright, RN Edrophonium test see Tensilon test Edwards\u2019 syndrome Definition Edwards\u2019 syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 18. For this reason, it is also called trisomy 18 syndrome. The extra chromosome is lethal for most babies born with this condition. It causes major physical abnor- malities and severe mental retardation, and very few chil- dren afflicted with this disease survive beyond a year. Description Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chromosomes are numbered 1\u201322, and the 23rd pair is composed of the sex chromosomes, X and Y . A person inherits one set of 23 chromosomes from each parent. Occasionally, a genetic error occurs during egg or sperm cell formation. A child conceived with such an egg or sperm cell may inherit an incorrect number of chromosomes. In the case of Edwards\u2019 syndrome, the child inherits three, rather than two, copies of chromosome 18. Trisomy 18 occurs in approximately one in every 3,000 newborns and affects girls more often than boys. Women older than their early thirties have a greater risk of conceiving a child with trisomy 18, but it can occur in younger women. Causes and symptoms A third copy of chromosome 18 causes numerous abnormalities. Most children born with Edwards\u2019 syn- drome appear weak and fragile, and they are often under- weight. The head is unusually small and the back of the head is prominent. The ears are malformed and low-set, and the mouth and jaw are small. The baby may also have a cleft lip or cleft palate. Frequently, the hands are clenched into fists, and the index finger overlaps the other fingers. The child may have clubfeet and toes may be webbed or fused. Numerous problems involving the internal organs may be present. Abnormalities often occur in the lungs and diaphragm (the muscle that controls breathing), and heart defects and blood vessel malformations are com- mon. The child may also have malformed kidneys and abnormalities of the urogenital system. Diagnosis Physical abnormalities point to Edwards\u2019 syndrome, but definitive diagnosis relies on karyotyping. Karyotyp- ing involves drawing the baby\u2019s blood or bone marrow for a microscopic examination of the chromosomes. Using special stains and microscopy, individual chromo- somes are identified, and the presence of an extra chro- mosome 18 is revealed. Trisomy 18 can be detected before birth. If a preg- nant woman is older than 35, has a family history of genetic abnormalities, has previously conceived a child with a genetic abnormality, or has suffered earlier miscar- riages, she may undergo tests to determine whether her child carries genetic abnormalities. Potential tests include maternal serum analysis or screening, ultrasonography, amniocentesis, and chorionic villus sampling. Treatment There is no cure for Edwards\u2019 syndrome. Since tri- somy 18 babies frequently have major physical abnor- malities, doctors and parents face difficult choices regarding treatment. Abnormalities can be treated to a certain degree with surgery, but extreme invasive proce- dures may not be in the best interests of an infant whose lifespan is measured in days or weeks. Medical therapy often consists of supportive care with the goal of making the infant comfortable, rather than prolonging life. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1136 Edwards\u2019 syndrome",

The antibiotics most commonly used are penicillin and vancomycin. Patients experiencing difficulty breathing are also given oxygen therapy. Surgical treatment of empyema has two goals: drainage of the infected fluid and closing up of the space left in the pleural cavity. If the infection is still in its early stages, the fluid can be drained by thoracentesis. In sec- ond-stage empyema, the surgeon will insert a chest tube in the patient\u2019s rib cage or remove part of a rib (rib resection) in order to drain the fluid. In third-stage empyema, the sur- geon may cut or peel away the thick fibrous layer coating the lung. This procedure is called decortication. When the fibrous covering is removed, the lung will expand to fill the space in the chest cavity. The doctor can use video- assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) techniques to position the chest tube or to perform a limited decortication. The V ATS technique allows a physician to see within the body during certain surgical procedures. Empyema of the gall- bladder is a serious condition that is treated with intra- venous antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Prognosis The prognosis for recovery is generally good, except in those cases with complications, such as a brain abscess or blood poisoning , or cases caused by certain types of streptococci.

Brain inflammation caused by a bacterial infection is sometimes called cerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord are involved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. An inflammation of the brain\u2019s covering, or meninges, is called meningitis. Description Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The inflammation is a reaction of the body\u2019s immune system to infection or invasion. During the inflammation, the brain\u2019s tissues become swollen. The combination of the infection and the immune reaction to it can cause headache and a fever, as well as more severe symptoms in some cases. Approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are reported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitis can be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi- demic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis is responsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. The viruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmit the disease. The most common form of non-epidemic or sporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death. Mumps is another example of a sporadic cause. Causes and symptoms Causes There are more than a dozen viruses that can cause encephalitis, spread by either human-to human contact or by animal bites. Encephalitis may occur with several common viral infections of childhood. Viruses and viral diseases that may cause encephalitis include: \u2022 chickenpox \u2022 measles \u2022 mumps \u2022 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1177 Encephalitis",

In elderly, chronically ill, or alcoholic patients, empyema is often caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae species of bacteria.

Family members may notice bad breath . In severe cases, the patient may become dehydrated, cough up blood or greenish-brown sputum, run a fever as high as 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C), or fall into a coma. Patients with thoracic empyema may develop poten- tially life-threatening complications if the condition is not treated. The infected tissues may develop large col- lections of pus (abscesses) that can rupture into the patient\u2019s airway, or the infection may spread to the tis- sues surrounding the heart. In extreme cases the empye- ma may spread to the brain by means of bacteria carried in the bloodstream. In pelvic empyema, the infection produces large amounts of thick, foul-smelling pus that is rapidly replaced even after drainage. Empyema of the gallblad- der is marked by intense pain on the upper right side of the abdomen, high fever, and rigidity of the muscles over the infected area. Diagnosis A physician may consider the possibility of empye- ma thoracis in patients with pneumonia or other symp- toms of lung infection. When listening to sounds within the patient\u2019s chest with a stethoscope, the sounds of breathing will be partly muffled and harder to hear in the patients with empyema. The area of the chest over the infection will sound dull when tapped or thumped (per- cussed). On an x ray, empyema thoracis will appear as a cloudy or opaque area. The amount of fluid present in the pleural cavity can be estimated using an ultrasound imaging procedure. The diagnosis of empyema, however, has to be confirmed with laboratory tests because its symptoms can be caused by other disease conditions. The diagnosis of empyema is usually confirmed by analyzing a sample of fluid taken from the pleural cavity. The sample is obtained by a procedure called thoracente- sis. In this procedure, the patient is given a local anesthet- ic, a needle is inserted into the pleural cavity through the back between the ribs on the infected side, and a sample of fluid is withdrawn. If the patient has empyema, there will be a very high level of one particular kind of immune cell (white blood cells), a high level of protein, and a very low level of blood sugar. The fluid can also be tested for the specific disease organism by staining or tissue cul- tures. In some cases, the color, smell, or consistency of the tissue fluid also helps to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment Empyema is treated using a combination of medica- tions and surgical techniques.

The herb elecampane may act as an expectorant to help patients clear mucus from the lungs. The patient should discuss these remedies with their health care practitioner prior to trying them, as some may interact with the more tradi- tional treatments that are already being used. Prognosis Emphysema is a serious and chronic disease that cannot be reversed. If detected early, the effects and progression can be slowed, particularly if the patient stops smoking immediately. Complications of emphy- sema include higher risks for pneumonia and acute bronchitis. Overall, the prognosis for patients with emphysema is poor, with a survival rate for all those with COPD of four years, and even less for emphyse- ma. However, individual cases vary and many patients can live much longer with supplemental oxygen and other treatment measures. Prevention The best way to prevent emphysema is to avoid smoking. Even patients with inherited emphysema should avoid smoking, as it especially worsens the onset and severity. If patients quit smoking as soon as evidence of small airway obstruction begins, they can significantly improve their prognosis. Resources BOOKS Beers, Mark H., and Robert Berkow, eds.

The name comes from the Greek word empyein meaning pus-producing (suppurate). Empyema is most often used to refer to col- lections of pus in the space around the lungs (pleural cav- ity), but sometimes refers to similar collections in the gall bladder or the pelvic cavity. Empyema in the pleural cavity is sometimes called empyema thoracis, or empye- ma of the chest, to distinguish it from empyema else- where in the body. Description Empyema may have a number of causes but is most frequently a complication of pneumonia . Its develop- ment can be divided into three phases: an acute phase in which the body cavity fills with a thin fluid containing some pus; a second stage in which the fluid thickens and a fibrous, coagulation protein (fibrin) begins to accumu- late within the cavity; and a third or chronic stage in which the lung or other organ is encased within a thick covering of fibrous material. Causes and symptoms Empyema thoracis can be caused by a number of dif- ferent organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and amebas, in connection with pneumonia, chest wounds, chest surgery, lung abscesses, or a ruptured esophagus. The infective organism can get into the pleural cavity either through the bloodstream or other circulatory system, in secretions from lung tissue, or on the surfaces of surgical instruments or objects that cause open chest wounds. The most com- mon organisms that cause empyema are the following bac- teria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureusis the most common cause in all age groups, accounting for 90% of cases of empyema in infants and children. Pelvic empyema in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1175 Empyema",

          "content": "Bacterial infection of the CNS can result in abscess- es and empyemas (accumulations of pus). Abscesses have fixed boundaries, but empyemas lack definable shape and size. CNS infections are classified according to the location where they occur. For example, a spinal epidural abscess is located above the dura mater, and a cranial subdural empyema occurs between the dura mater and the arachnoid. As pus and other material from an infection accumu- late, pressure is exerted on the brain or spinal cord. This pressure can damage the nervous system tissue, possibly permanently. Without treatment, a CNS infection is fatal. Causes and symptoms Typically, bacterial invasion results from the spread of a nearby infection; for example, a chronic sinus or middle ear infection can extend beyond its initial site. Bacteria may also be conveyed to the CNS from distant sites of infection by the bloodstream. In rare cases, head trauma or surgical procedures may introduce bacteria KEY TERMS Abscess\u2014A pus-filled area with definite borders. Arachnoid\u2014One of the membranes that sheathes the spinal cord and brain; the arachnoid is the sec- ond-layer membrane. Cerebrospinal fluid\u2014Fluid that is normally found in the spinal cord and brain. Abnormal levels of certain molecules in this fluid can indicate the presence of infection or damage to the central ner- vous system. CT scan (computed tomography)\u2014Cross-sectional x rays of the body are compiled to create a three- dimensional image of the body\u2019s internal structures. Dura mater\u2014One of the membranes that sheathes the spinal cord and brain; the dura mater is the outermost layer. Empyema\u2014A pus-filled area with indefinite borders. Lumbar puncture \u2014A procedure in which a nee- dle is inserted into the lower spine to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) \u2014An imaging technique that uses a large circular magnet and radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the body. These signals are used to construct images of internal structures. directly into the CNS. However, the source of infection cannot always be identified. Specific symptoms of a CNS infection hinge on its exact location, but may include severe headache or back pain, weakness, sensory loss, and a fever. An individual may report a stiff neck, nausea or vomiting, and tiredness or disorientation. There is a potential for seizures, paral- ysis, or coma. Diagnosis Physical symptoms, such as a fever and intense backache or a fever, severe headache, and stiff neck, raise the suspicion of a CNS infection. Blood tests may indi- cate the presence of an infection but do not pinpoint its location. CT scans or MRI scans of the brain and spine can provide definitive diagnosis, with an MRI scan being the most sensitive. A lumbar puncture and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid can help diagnose an epidural abscess; however, the procedure can be dangerous in cases of subdural empyema. Treatment A two-pronged approach is taken to treat CNS infec- tions. First, antibiotic therapy against an array of potential infectious bacteria is begun. The second stage involves surgery to drain the infected site. Although some CNS infections have been resolved with antibiotics alone, the more aggressive approach is often preferred. Surgery allows immediate relief of pressure on the brain or spinal cord, as well as an opportunity to collect infectious material for bac- terial identification. Once the bacterial species is identified, drug therapy can be altered to a more specific antibiotic. However, surgery may not be an option in some cases, such as when there are numerous sites of infection or when infec- tion is located in an inaccessible area of the brain. Prognosis The fatality rate associated with CNS infections ranges from 10% to as high as 40%. Some survivors experience permanent CNS damage, resulting in partial paralysis, speech problems, or seizures. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good prognosis. With prompt medical attention, an individual may recover completely. Prevention Treatment for pre-existing infections, such as sinus or middle ear infections, may prevent some cases of CNS infection. However, since some CNS infections are of unknown origin, not all are preventable. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 690 Central nervous system infections",

Toni Rizzo Chest drainage therapy Definition Chest drainage therapy involves the removal of air, blood, pus, or other secretions from the chest cavity. Purpose Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection. Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer- gency or a planned procedure. Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity is also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some- times called thoracostomy tube drainage. Conditions that may need to be treated by chest drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues of the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu- mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions include cancer that causes excessive secretions, empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax (blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage therapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavity after lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung is collapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapy allows the lung to reinflate. Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 743 Chest drainage therapy",

Fetal monitoring Fetal monitoring is a process in which the baby\u2019s heart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during labor and birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring. A special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be used. This is a simple and non-invasive method. The Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a handheld listening device that transmits the sounds of the heart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece. It can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks after conception. This method offers intermittent monitoring. It allows the mother freedom to move about and is also useful during contractions. Electronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and provides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to the mother\u2019s contractions. It can be used either continuously or intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan- cies, and is not often recommended for low risk ones KEY TERMS Amniotic sac \u2014The membranous sac that sur- rounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid as pregnancy advances. Breech birth\u2014Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead of the usual head first delivery. This can add to labor and delivery problems because the baby\u2019s bottom doesn\u2019t mold a passage through the birth canal as well as does the head. Cervix\u2014A small cylindrical organ about an inch or so long and less than an inch around that makes up the lower part and neck of the uterus. The cervix separates the body and cavity of the uterus from the vagina. Embryo\u2014The unborn child during the first eight weeks of its development following conception. Gestation \u2014The period from conception to birth, during which the developing fetus is carried in the uterus. Perineum\u2014The area between the thighs that lies behind the genital organs and in front of the anus. Placenta \u2014The organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and that links the blood supplies of mother and baby. because it renders the mother immobile and requires interpretation. Internal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more accurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu- ous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires the mother\u2019s water to be broken and that she be two to three centimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only. Telemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor- ing. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrument on the mother\u2019s thigh. The mother is able to remain mobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used in high-risk situations. Treatment Most women choose some type of pain relief during childbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to drugs. The specific choice may depend on what\u2019s available, the woman\u2019s preferences, her doctor\u2019s recommendations, and how the labor is proceeding. All drugs have some risks and some advantages. Regional anesthetics Regional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals. In this technique, medication is injected into the space around the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med- ications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig- nals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensation from the waist down. An epidural or spinal block can provide complete pain relief during cesarean birth. An epidural is placed with the woman lying on her side or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allow more space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbed with antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in the skin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between two vertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of the spinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con- tinuous doses of anesthetic to be given. This type of anesthesia provides complete pain relief, and can help conserve a woman\u2019s energy, since she can relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes- thesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may be harder for a woman to bear down when it comes time to push, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjusted as this stage nears. Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as epidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c- section delivery. It is administered in the same way as an epidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amount of anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected at one time. Because of the anesthetic\u2019s effect on motor nerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 760 Childbirth",

Richard Robinson Electronic fetal monitoring Definition Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for examining the condition of a baby in the uterus by noting any unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni- toring is performed late in pregnancyor continuously dur- ing labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFM can be utilized either externally or internally in the womb. Purpose The heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust- ment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli. The fetal monitor records an unborn baby\u2019s heart rate and graphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoring is usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when the baby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFM include: babies in a breech position, premature labor , and induced labor, among others. When electronic fetal monitoring was originally introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that it would help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lack of oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birth asphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn deaths. It occurs when there are less than normal amounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ and there is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue. A lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia. Perinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth, shortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If the interruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the baby may recover without any damage. If the time is longer, there may be some injury that is reversible. If the time period without oxygen is very long, there may be perma- nent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor- tant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible. One of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm in the unborn baby, which can be detected by electronic fetal monitoring. The fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the machine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby\u2019s heartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits just picks up the sound of the baby\u2019s heart beating. The fetal monitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heart rate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con- tractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps the doctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling the stress of contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby\u2019s heartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then go back to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks for any changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there is a drastic drop in the baby\u2019s heart beat or if the heart rate does not recover immediately after a contraction. Because it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When an adult complains to a provider about not feeling well, checking the heart rate is only one of many things that the doctor will do. With an unborn baby, however, check- ing the heart rate is basically the only thing that a doctor or midwife can do. Fetal monitoring can be helpful in a variety of differ- ent situations. During pregnancy, fetal monitoring can be used as a part of antepartum testing .

In this test, changes in the baby\u2019s heart rate are measured along with the fetus\u2019 own movements. The heart rate of a healthy baby should go up whenever she or he moves. Fetal monitoring is used on and off during early labor. As labor progresses, more monitoring is often needed. Usually, as the time for delivery nears, the moni- tor is left on continuously since the end of labor tends to be the most stressful time for the baby. A baby who is having trouble in labor will show char- acteristic changes in heart rate after a contraction (late decelerations). If a baby is not receiving enough oxygen to withstand the stress of labor and delivery is many hours away, a cesarean section(C-section) may be necessary. Description Using the external fetal monitor is simple and painless. Two elastic belts are placed around the mother\u2019s abdomen. One belt holds a listening device in place while the other belt holds the contraction monitor. The nurse or midwife adjusts the belts to get the best readings from each device. Sometimes, it is difficult to hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat with the external monitoring device. Other times, the monitor may show subtle signs of a developing problem. In either case, the doctor or midwife may recommend that the external belt be replaced with an internal monitor. The internal monitor is an electronic wire that rests directly on the baby\u2019s head. The provider can place it on the baby\u2019s head during an internal exam. The internal monitor can only be used when the cervix is already open. This device provides a more accurate record of the baby\u2019s heart rate.

Risks External EFM poses no direct risks to the baby. How- ever, because of being connected to the machine, the mother cannot walk around. This inactivity may prolong labor and reduce oxygen levels in the mother\u2019s blood, both of which can be detrimental to the unborn baby. Another problem is that electronic fetal monitoring seems to be associated with an increase in caesarian deliveries. There is a concern that EFM can give false alarms of distress in the baby, and that this can lead to unneeded caesarians. With internal monitoring, there is a higher risk for infec- tion. For these and other reasons, the United States Pre- ventive Services Task Force states that there is some evi- dence that using electronic fetal monitoring on low-risk women in labor might not be indicated. Many physicians, however, continue to use EFM routinely, and believe it to be of value in both low-risk and high-risk labors. Normal results An unborn baby\u2019s heart rate normally ranges from 120\u2013160 beats per minute (bpm). A baby who is receiv- ing enough oxygen through the placenta will move around. The monitor strip will show the baby\u2019s heart rate rising briefly as he/she moves (just as an adult\u2019s heart rate rises when he/she moves). The baby\u2019s monitor strip is considered to be reactive when the baby\u2019s heart rate rises at least 20 bpm above the baseline heart rate for at least 20 seconds. This must occur at least twice in a 20-minute period. A reactive heart rate tracing (also known as a reactive non-stress test) is considered a sign of the baby\u2019s well being. Abnormal results If the baby\u2019s heart rate drops very low or rises very high, this signals a serious problem. In either of these cases it is obvious that the baby is in distress and must be delivered soon. However, many babies who are having problems do not give such clear signs. During a contraction, the flow of oxygen (from the mother) through the placenta (to the baby) is temporarily stopped. It is as if the baby has to hold its breath during each contraction. Both the placenta and the baby are designed to withstand this condition. Between contrac- tions, the baby should be receiving more than enough oxygen to do well during the contraction. The first sign that a baby is not getting enough oxy- gen between contractions is often a drop in the baby\u2019s heart rate after the contraction (late deceleration). The baby\u2019s heart rate recovers to a normal level between con- tractions, only to drop again after the next contraction. This is also a more subtle sign of distress.

Electrophysiology study of the heart Definition An electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a nonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system (normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car- diac catheters and sophisticated computers to generate electrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea- surements with exquisite precision from within the heart chambers. The EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic purposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca- tion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunction with a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation. The test is simple, not painful, and performed in a special laboratory under controlled clinical circum- stances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize in electrophysiology. Purpose A cardiologist may recommend an EP study when the standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress test, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide enough information to evaluate an abnormal heart rhythm, called an arrhythmia. An EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a suspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptoms of an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detected from other tests. The purpose and great value of an EP study is that it offers more detailed information to the doctor about the electrical activity in the heart than the aforementioned noninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directly on heart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to determine the specific location of an arrhythmia and, oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. This corrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure, and, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heart medications. EP studies may be helpful in assessing: \u2022 certain tachycardias or bradycardias of unknown cause. \u2022 patients who have been resuscitated after experiencing sudden cardiac death. \u2022 various symptoms of unknown cause, such as chest pain, shortness of breath , fatigue, or syncope (dizzi- ness/fainting). \u2022 response to anti-arrhythmic therapy. Precautions Pregnant patients should not undergo an EP study because of exposure to radiation during the study, which may be harmful to the growing baby. Patients who have coronary artery disease may need to have that treated before having an EP study. Description The rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is essentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulses traveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham- bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which are specialized cells situated in the top right chamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SA node, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generates the impulses, which travel through specific pathways throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node. The A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses to more specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottom chambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathways become damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path- ways exist, the heart\u2019s rhythm may be altered (perhaps too slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriously affect the heart\u2019s pumping ability. The patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP lab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets are placed over him or her. A minimum of two catheters are inserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groin area. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the number of catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heart may vary. For certain tachycardias, two more catheters may be inserted in the left groin and one in the internal jugular (neck) vein or in the subclavian (below the clavi- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1163 Electrophysiology study of the heart",

Several laboratory tests of the patient\u2019s blood pro- vide information for diagnosis. Measurement of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level in the patient\u2019s blood serum is the most useful laboratory test in the early stages. In a normal pregnancy, the level of this hormone doubles about every two days during the first 10 weeks. In an ectopic pregnancy, the rate of the increase is much slower and the low hCG for the stage of the pregnancy is a strong indication that the pregnancy is abnormal. (It could also represent a miscarriage in progress.) The level is usually tested several times over a period of days to determine whether or not it is increas- ing at a normal rate. Progesterone levels in the blood are also measured. Lower than expected levels can indicate that the pregnan- cy is not normal. An ultrasound examination may provide information about whether or not the pregnancy is ectopic. A device KEY TERMS Embryo\u2014In humans, the developing organism from conception until approximately the end of the second month.

Zygote\u2014The fertilized egg. called a transducer, which emits high frequency sound waves, is moved over the surface of the patient\u2019s abdomen or inserted into the vagina. The sound waves bounce off of the internal organs and create an image on a screen. The doctor should be able to see whether or not there is a fetus developing in the uterus after at least five weeks of gestation. Before that point, a normal pregnan- cy is too small to see. A culdocentesis may also help confirm a diagnosis. In this procedure a needle is inserted into the space at the top of the vagina, behind the uterus and in front of the rectum. Blood in this area may indicate bleeding from a ruptured fallopian tube. A laparoscopy will enable the doctor to see the patient\u2019s reproductive organs and examine an ectopic pregnancy. In this technique, a hollow tube with a light on one end is inserted through a small incision in the abdomen. Through this instrument the internal organs can be observed. Treatment Ectopic pregnancy requires immediate treatment. The earlier the condition is treated, the better the chance to preserve the fallopian tube intact for future normal pregnancies. Medical If the ectopic pregnancy is discovered in a very early stage of development, the drug methotrexate may be given. The best results are obtained when the pregnancy is less than six weeks old and the tubal mass is no more than 1.4 in (3.5 cm) in diameter. Methotrexate, which has been used successfully since 1987, works by inhibiting the growth of rapidly growing cells. (It is also used to treat some cancers.) Most side effects are mild and tem- porary, but the patient must be monitored after treatment. Usually the medication is injected into the muscle in a single dose, but may also be given intravenously or injected directly into the fallopian tube to dissolve the embryonic tissue. Methotrexate has also been used to treat ovarian, abdominal, and cervical pregnancies that are discovered in the early stages. Surgical When a laparoscopy is done to visualize the ectopic pregnancy, the scope can be fitted with surgical tools and used to remove the ectopic mass immediately after it is identified. The affected fallopian tube can be repaired or removed as necessary. This procedure can be done with- out requiring the patient to stay in the hospital overnight.

Once the episiotomy is made, the baby is born with a few pushes. Third stage In the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out of the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. The placenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam- eter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and has served to convey nourishment from the mother to the fetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con- tractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point. It is important that all of the placenta be removed from the uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normal after delivery may be much heavier. Breech presentation Approximately 4% of babies are in what is called the \u201cbreech\u201d position when labor begins. In breech pre- sentation, the baby\u2019s head is not the part pressing against the cervix. Instead the baby\u2019s bottom or legs are posi- tioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. An obstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head down position using a technique called version. This is only successful approximately half the time. The risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation are much higher than with a head-first presentation and the mother and attending practitioner will need to weigh the risks and make a decision on whether to deliver via a cesarean section or attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of the risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre- sentation\u2014of which there are three. Frank breech (the baby\u2019s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com- mon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types are complete breech (in which the baby\u2019s legs are crossed under and in front of the body) and footling breech (in which one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birth canal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery. Even in complete breech, other factors should be met before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasound examination should be done to be sure the baby does not have an unusually large head and that the head is tilted forward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetal monitoring and close observation of the progress of labor are also important. A slowing of labor or any indication of difficulty in the body passing through the pelvis should be an indication that it is safer to consider a cesarean section. Forceps delivery If the labor is not progressing as it should or if the baby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for a forceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device that resembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around the baby\u2019s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out of the vagina. Forceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated, and they might be required if: \u2022 the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the baby into the birth canal \u2022 the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal unaided \u2022 the baby shows signs of stress \u2022 the mother is too exhausted to push Before placing the forceps around the baby\u2019s head, pain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth- er. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother\u2019s bladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapy water. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth, although tears can still occur. The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time into the vagina and around the side of the baby\u2019s head to gently grasp the head. When both \u201ctongs\u201d are in place, the doctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through the birth canal as the uterus contracts. Sometimes the baby can be delivered this way after the very next contraction. The frequency of forceps delivery varies from one hospital to the next, depending on the experience of staff and the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital. Some obstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as a way to avoid cesarean birth. However, other obstetrical services don\u2019t use forceps at all.

Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do not involve radiation levels that are harmful to the unborn baby. Description Manometry This study is designed to measure the pressure changes produced by contraction of the muscular por- tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function of any one of the segments of the swallowing tube causes difficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys- phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating those patients whose endoscopy is negative. During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube carrying a device that senses changes in pressures in the esophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal- lowing. Medications are sometimes given during the study to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans- mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can best identify diseases that produce disturbances of motility or contractions of the esophagus. Esophageal pH monitoring This procedure involves measuring the esophagus\u2019 exposure to acid that has \u201crefluxed\u201d from the stomach. The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn or GERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, but also ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing (strictures) when they heal. Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux. Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp- tying and production of saliva are other important protec- tive mechanisms. \u201cpH\u201d is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in the esophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per- sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has been designed to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu- ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their daily routine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in their activities they occurred. During this period, a thin tube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to record changes. After the study, a computer is used to compare changes in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient. Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of many patients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge the effects of drug therapy. X-ray tests These fall into two categories: (1) those done with the use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per- formed with radioactive materials. Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest value in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph- agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal function test, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnostic possibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated with barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction. During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the passage of material through the esophagus in real time, and video recordings can also be done. This is particularly useful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com- mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke, although other diseases of the neuromuscular system (like myasthenia gravis) can produce the same symptoms. Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are use- ful because they are able not only to demonstrate that food passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor- mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow- ing food coated with material that is followed by a nuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when other methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it is necessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. As of 1997, scans mainly served as research tools. Preparation Patients should not eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Many medications affect the esopha- gus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or even stopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of all medications taken, including over-the-counter medica- tions (purchased without a doctor\u2019s prescription), and any known allergies. Aftercare For most of these studies, no special care is needed after the procedure. Patients can often go about normal daily activities following any of these tests. One excep- tion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the use of barium. This can have a constipating effect and patients should ask about using a mild laxative later on.

Imaging analysis may further con- firm the presence of potential causes of pain. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an analgesic lad- der. This treatment approach provides medication selec- tions based on previous analgesic use and severity of pain. The ladder starts with the use of non-opioid (non-mor- phine) drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophin, or non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medications for control of mild pain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and con- sistently administered medication(s). The \u201ctake as needed\u201d approach is not advised. Supplemental doses may be rec- ommended in addition to the standard dose for circum- stances that may worsen pain. Opioids (i.e., morphine and codeine) are the medications of choice for moderate to severe pain. Doses are adjusted to produce maximum pain relief while minimizing side effects. These medications are conveniently administered orally. Administering steroids can help reduce nausea and vomiting. Delirium and anxi- ety may be improved by psychoactive medications. Aftercare Care for palliation is continuous and consistent for the remainder of life. Patients who have less than six months of life remaining may choose a hospice to stop treatment and control pain. Risks Patients taking opioids for pain relief can develop tol- erance and dependence. Tolerance develops when a patient requires increasing amounts of medication to produce pain reduction. Dependence shows characteristic withdrawal symptoms if medications are abruptly stopped. These symptoms can be avoided by tapering down doses in the event that these medications should be stopped.

Laith Farid Gulli, M.D. Nicole Mallory, M.S. Cancer therapy, supportive Definition Supportive cancer therapy is the use of medicines to counteract unwanted effects of cancer treatment. Purpose Along with their beneficial effects, many cancer treatments produce uncomfortable and sometimes harm- ful side effects. For example, cancer drugs may cause nausea or vomiting. They may also destroy red or white blood cells, resulting in a low blood count. Fortunately, many of these side effects can be relieved with other medicines. Description Different kinds of drugs are used for different pur- poses in supportive cancer therapy. To relieve nausea and vomiting , a physician may prescribe dolasetron (Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril) or ondansetron (Zofran). Drugs called colony stimulating factors are used to help the bone marrow make new white blood cells to replace those destroyed by cancer treatment. Examples of colony stimulating factors are filgrastim (Neupogen) and sar- gramostim (Leukine). Another type of drug, epoetin (Epogen, Procrit), stimulates the bone marrow to make new red blood cells. It is a synthetically made version of human erythropoietin that is made naturally in the body and has the same effect on bone marrow. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2642 Cancer therapy, supportive",

TENS doesn\u2019t cure any condition; it simply eases pain. Patients who are not sure what is causing their pain should consult a physician before using TENS. Description The TENS device is a small battery-powered stimu- lator that produces low-intensity electrical signals through electrodes on or near a painful area, producing a tingling sensation that reduces pain. There is no dosage limitation, and the patient controls the amount of pain relief. Some experts believe TENS works by blocking pain signals in the spinal cord, or by delivering electrical impulses to underlying nerve fibers that lessen the expe- rience of pain. Others suspect that the electrical stimula- tion triggers the release of natural painkillers in the body. Patients can rent a TENS unit before buying one, to see if it is effective against their pain. Preparation After TENS has been prescribed, a doctor will refer the patient to a TENS specialist, who will explain how to use the machine. The specialist works with the patient to determine the settings and electrode placements for the best pain relief. KEY TERMS Fibromyalgia \u2014A condition characterized by aching and stiffness, fatigue and poor sleep, as well as tenderness at various sites on the body. Osteoarthritis\u2014A painful joint disease aggravated by mechanical stress. Phantom limb\u2014The perception that a limb is pre- sent (and throbbing with pain) after it has been amputated. Post-herpetic neuralgia \u2014Lingering pain that can last for years after an attack of shingles. Sciatica \u2014Pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve, extending from the buttock down the leg to the foot. Temporomandibular joint pain (TMJ) \u2014Pain and other symptoms affecting the head, jaw, and face that are caused when the jaw joints and muscles controlling them don\u2019t work together correctly. Risks TENS is nonaddictive and completely safe. The only side effect may be a slight skin irritation or redness in some people, which can be prevented by using different gels or electrodes. Normal results The amount of relief a person gets using TENS depends on the underlying cause of the pain, a person\u2019s mental state, and whether or not medication is also used. At least one study found that both a real TENS machine and a placebo were equally effective in reducing pain. This suggests that at least part of its effectiveness may be due to the patient\u2019s belief in its ability to ease pain. Carol A.

          "content": "diaphragm is effective only if used during every episode of sexual intercourse. The same is true for condoms and the cervical cap. Some methods are automatically work- ing every day, no matter what. These methods include Depo Provera, Norplant, the IUD, and tubal sterilization. There are many different ways to use birth control. They can be divided into several groups: \u2022 By mouth (oral)\u2014Birth control pills must be taken by mouth every day. \u2022 Injected\u2014Depo Provera is a hormonal medication that is given by injection every three months. \u2022 Implanted\u2014Norplant is a long-acting hormonal form of birth control that is implanted under the skin of the upper arm. \u2022 Vaginal\u2014Spermicides and barrier methods work in the vagina. \u2022 Intra-uterine\u2014The IUD is inserted into the uterus. \u2022 Surgical\u2014Tubal sterilization is a form of surgery. A doctor must perform the procedure in a hospital or sur- gical clinic. Many women need general anesthesia. The methods of birth control differ from each other in the timing of when they are used. Some methods of birth control must be used specifically at the time of sex- ual intercourse (condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, sper- micides). All other methods of birth control must be working all the time to provide protection (hormonal methods, IUDs, tubal sterilization). Precautions There are risks associated with some forms of birth control. Some of the risks of each method are listed below: \u2022 Birth control pills\u2014The hormone (estrogen) in birth control pills can increase the risk of heart attack in women over 40 who smoke. \u2022 IUD\u2014The IUD can increase the risk of serious pelvic infection. The IUD can also injure the uterus by poking into or through the uterine wall. Surgery might be need- ed to fix this. \u2022 Tubal sterilization\u2014\u201cTying the tubes\u201d is a surgical pro- cedure and has all the risks of any other surgery, includ- ing the risks of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding. Preparation No specific preparation is needed before using con- traception. However, a woman must be sure that she is not already pregnant before using a hormonal method or having an IUD placed. Aftercare No aftercare is needed. Risks Many methods of birth control have side effects. Knowing the side effects can help a woman to determine which method of birth control is right for her. \u2022 Hormonal methods\u2014The hormones in birth control pills, Depo Provera, and Norplant can cause changes in menstrual periods, changes in mood, weight gain, acne, and headaches. In addition, it may take many months to begin ovulating again once a woman stops using Depo Provera or Norplant. \u2022 Barrier methods\u2014A woman must insert the diaphragm in just the right way to be sure that it works properly. Some women get more urinary tract infections if they use a diaphragm. This is because the diaphragm can press against the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the outside. \u2022 Spermicides\u2014Some women and men are allergic to spermicides or find them irritating to the skin. \u2022 IUD\u2014The IUD is a foreign body that stays inside the uterus, and the uterus tries to get it out. A woman may have heavier menstrual periods and more menstrual cramping with an IUD in place.

Diagnosis The appearance of the skin, paired with pain and fever raises the possibility of flesh-eating disease. An x ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography scans (CT scans) of the area reveals a feathery pattern in the tissue, caused by accumulating gas in the dying tissue. Necrosis is evident during exploratory surgery, during which samples are collected for bacterial identification. Treatment Rapid, aggressive medical treatment, specifically, antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement, is impera- tive. Antibiotics may include penicillin, an aminoglyco- side or third-generation cephalosporin, and clindamycin or metronidazole. Analgesics are employed for pain con- trol. During surgical debridement, dead tissue is stripped away. After surgery, patients are rigorously monitored for continued infection, shock, or other complications. If available, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has also be used. Prognosis Flesh-eating disease has a fatality rate of about 30%. Diabetes, arteriosclerosis, immunosuppression, kidney disease, malnutrition, and obesity are connected with a poor prognosis. Older individuals and intravenous drug users may also be at higher risk. The infection site also has a role. Survivors may require plastic surgery and may have to contend with permanent physical disability and psychological adjustment. Prevention Flesh-eating disease, which occurs very rarely, can- not be definitively prevented. The best ways to lower the risk of contracting flesh-eating disease are: \u2022 take care to avoid any injury to the skin that may give the bacteria a place of entry \u2022 when skin injuries do occur, they should be promptly washed and treated with an antibiotic ointment or spray \u2022 people who have any skin injury should rigorously attempt to avoid people who are infected with streptococ- ci bacteria.

          "content": "Precautions Pregnant patients undergoing x-ray exams should carefully review the risks and benefits with their doctors. Most x-ray exams of the gastrointestinal tract do not involve radiation levels that are harmful to the unborn baby. Description Manometry This study is designed to measure the pressure changes produced by contraction of the muscular por- tions of the esophagus. An abnormality in the function of any one of the segments of the swallowing tube causes difficulty in swallowing. Doctors call this symptom dys- phagia. This exam is most useful in evaluating those patients whose endoscopy is negative. During manometry, the patient swallows a thin tube carrying a device that senses changes in pressures in the esophagus. Readings are taken at rest and during swal- lowing. Medications are sometimes given during the study to help in the diagnosis. The results are then trans- mitted to recording equipment. Manometry can best identify diseases that produce disturbances of motility or contractions of the esophagus. Esophageal pH monitoring This procedure involves measuring the esophagus\u2019 exposure to acid that has \u201crefluxed\u201d from the stomach. The test is ideal for evaluating recurring heartburn or GERD. Too much acid produces not only heartburn, but also ulcers that can bleed or produce areas of narrowing (strictures) when they heal. Normally, acid refluxes into the esophagus in only small amounts for short periods of time. A muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter prevents excessive reflux. Spontaneous contractions that increase esophageal emp- tying and production of saliva are other important protec- tive mechanisms. \u201cpH\u201d is the scientific term that tells just how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Researchers have shown that in the esophagus, the presence of acid is damaging only if it per- sists for prolonged periods. Therefore, the test has been designed to monitor the level of acidity over 24 hours, usu- ally in the home. In this way, patients maintain their daily routine, documenting their symptoms, and at what point in their activities they occurred. During this period, a thin tube with a pH monitor remains in the esophagus to record changes. After the study, a computer is used to compare changes in acidity with symptoms reported by the patient. Surgery is an effective and long-lasting treatment for symptoms of recurrent reflux and is the choice of many patients and doctors. pH monitoring is usually performed before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and to judge the effects of drug therapy. X-ray tests These fall into two categories: (1) those done with the use of barium and a fluoroscope; and (2) those per- formed with radioactive materials. Studies performed with fluoroscopy are of greatest value in identifying a structural abnormality of the esoph- agus. Although this is not truly an esophageal function test, it does allow doctors to consider other diagnostic possibilities. Often a sandwich or marshmallow coated with barium is used to identify the site of an obstruction. During fluoroscopy, the radiologist can observe the passage of material through the esophagus in real time, and video recordings can also be done. This is particularly useful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com- mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke, although other diseases of the neuromuscular system (like myasthenia gravis) can produce the same symptoms. Scans using low-dose radioactive materials are use- ful because they are able not only to demonstrate that food passes through the esophagus more slowly than nor- mal, but also how slow. These studies involve swallow- ing food coated with material that is followed by a nuclear medicine scanner. Scans are best used when other methods have failed to make a diagnosis, or if it is necessary to determine the degree of the abnormality. As of 1997, scans mainly served as research tools. Preparation Patients should not eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Many medications affect the esopha- gus; doses sometimes need to be adjusted or even stopped for a while. Patients must inform doctors of all medications taken, including over-the-counter medica- tions (purchased without a doctor\u2019s prescription), and any known allergies. Aftercare For most of these studies, no special care is needed after the procedure. Patients can often go about normal daily activities following any of these tests. One excep- tion is for those who undergo an x-ray exam with the use of barium. This can have a constipating effect and patients should ask about using a mild laxative later on. Risks Exposure of a fetus to x rays, especially in the first three months, is a potential risk. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1243 Esophageal function tests",

Once the episiotomy is made, the baby is born with a few pushes. Third stage In the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed out of the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. The placenta is pancake shaped and about 10 inches in diam- eter. It has been attached to the wall of the uterus and has served to convey nourishment from the mother to the fetus throughout the pregnancy. Continuing uterine con- tractions cause it to separate from the uterus at this point. It is important that all of the placenta be removed from the uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normal after delivery may be much heavier. Breech presentation Approximately 4% of babies are in what is called the \u201cbreech\u201d position when labor begins. In breech pre- sentation, the baby\u2019s head is not the part pressing against the cervix. Instead the baby\u2019s bottom or legs are posi- tioned to enter the birth canal instead of the head. An obstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to a head down position using a technique called version. This is only successful approximately half the time. The risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation are much higher than with a head-first presentation and the mother and attending practitioner will need to weigh the risks and make a decision on whether to deliver via a cesarean section or attempt a vaginal birth. The extent of the risk depends to a great extent on the type of breech pre- sentation\u2014of which there are three. Frank breech (the baby\u2019s legs are folded up against its body) is the most com- mon and the safest for vaginal delivery. The other types are complete breech (in which the baby\u2019s legs are crossed under and in front of the body) and footling breech (in which one leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birth canal) are not considered safe to attempt vaginal delivery. Even in complete breech, other factors should be met before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasound examination should be done to be sure the baby does not have an unusually large head and that the head is tilted forward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetal monitoring and close observation of the progress of labor are also important. A slowing of labor or any indication of difficulty in the body passing through the pelvis should be an indication that it is safer to consider a cesarean section. Forceps delivery If the labor is not progressing as it should or if the baby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for a forceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device that resembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around the baby\u2019s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently out of the vagina. Forceps can be used after the cervix is fully dilated, and they might be required if: \u2022 the umbilical cord has dropped down in front of the baby into the birth canal \u2022 the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal unaided \u2022 the baby shows signs of stress \u2022 the mother is too exhausted to push Before placing the forceps around the baby\u2019s head, pain medication or anesthesia may be given to the moth- er. The doctor may use a catheter to empty the mother\u2019s bladder, and may clean the perineal area with soapy water. Often an episiotomy is done before a forceps birth, although tears can still occur. The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time into the vagina and around the side of the baby\u2019s head to gently grasp the head. When both \u201ctongs\u201d are in place, the doctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby through the birth canal as the uterus contracts. Sometimes the baby can be delivered this way after the very next contraction. The frequency of forceps delivery varies from one hospital to the next, depending on the experience of staff and the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital. Some obstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as a way to avoid cesarean birth. However, other obstetrical services don\u2019t use forceps at all.

Diabetes can also develop as a result of pancreatic disease, alcoholism , malnutrition , or other severe ill- nesses that stress the body. Causes and symptoms Causes The causes of diabetes mellitus are unclear, howev- er, there seem to be both hereditary (genetic factors passed on in families) and environmental factors involved. Research has shown that some people who develop diabetes have common genetic markers. In Type I diabetes, the immune system, the body\u2019s defense sys- tem against infection, is believed to be triggered by a virus or another microorganism to destroy the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. In Type II diabetes, age, obesity, and family history of diabetes play a roll. In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to the insulin produced and it may not work as effectively. Symptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually that a person may not know that they have it. Early signs are lethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Other symptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow wound healing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurred vision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect- ed while a patient is seeing a doctor about another health concern that is actually being caused by the yet undiag- nosed diabetes. Individuals who are at high risk of developing Type II diabetes mellitus include people who: \u2022 are obese (more than 20% above their ideal body weight) \u2022 have a relative with diabetes mellitus \u2022 belong to a high-risk ethnic population (African-Amer- ican, Native American, Hispanic, or Native Hawaiian) \u2022 have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes or have delivered a baby weighing more than 9 lbs (4 kg) \u2022 have high blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or above) \u2022 have a high density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than or equal to 35 mg/dL and/or a triglyceride level greater than or equal to 250 mg/dL \u2022 have had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fast- ing glucose on previous testing Several common medications can impair the body\u2019s use of insulin, causing a condition known as secondary diabetes. These medications include treatments for high blood pressure (furosemide, clonidine, and thiazide diuretics ), drugs with hormonal activity ( oral contra- ceptives , thyroid hormone, progestins, and glucocorti- corids), and the anti-inflammation drug indomethacin. Several drugs that are used to treat mood disorders (such as anxiety and depression) can also impair glucose absorption. These drugs include haloperidol, lithium car- bonate, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and adrenergic agonists. Other medications that can cause diabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid, cimetidine, and heparin. Symptoms Symptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over days or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles- cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in overweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp- toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination, excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss. Ketoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or uncontrolled diabetes, is common in Type I diabetes. Ketones are acid compounds that form in the blood when the body breaks down fats and proteins. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, extreme lethargy and drowsiness. Patients with ketoaci- dosis will also have a sweet breath odor. Left untreated, this condition can lead to coma and death. With Type II diabetes, the condition may not become evident until the patient presents for medical treatment for some other condition. A patient may have heart disease, chronic infections of the gums and urinary tract, blurred vision, numbness in the feet and legs, or slow-healing wounds. Women may experience genital itching.

Description People who have diabetes have a greater-than-average chance of developing foot infections. Because a person who has diabetes may not feel foot pain or discomfort, problems can remain undetected until fever, weakness, or other signs of systemic infection appear. As a result, even minor irritations occur more often, heal more slowly, and are more likely to result in serious health problems. With diabetes, foot infections occur more frequently because the disease causes nervous system changes and poor circulation. Because the nerves that control sweat- ing no longer work, the skin of the feet can become very dry and cracked, and calluses tend to occur more fre- quently and build up faster. If not trimmed regularly, these calluses can turn into open sores or ulcers. Because diabetic nerve damage can cause a loss of sensation (neu- ropathy), if the feet are not regularly inspected, an ulcer can quickly become infected and, if not treated, may result in the death of tissue (gangrene) or amputation. The risk of infection is greatest for people who are over the age of 60 and for those who have one or more of the following: \u2022 poorly controlled diabetes \u2022 foot ulcers \u2022 laser treatment for changes in the retina \u2022 kidney or vascular disease \u2022 loss of sensation (neuropathy) Causes and symptoms Bacteria can cause an infection through small cracks (fissures) that can develop in the dry skin around the heel and on other parts of the foot or through corns, calluses, blisters, hangnails, or ulcers. If not treated, the bacterial infection can destroy skin, tissue, and bone or spread throughout the body. Common sites of diabetic foot infections include the following: \u2022 blisters, corns, or callouses that bleed beneath the skin \u2022 bunions, hammertoes, or other abnormalities in the bones of the foot GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1053 Diabetic foot infections",

The treatment includes changes in diet, oral medications, and in some cases, daily injections of insulin. Description Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes serious health complications including renal (kidney) failure, heart disease, stroke, and blindness. Approxi- mately 14 million Americans (about 5% of the popula- tion) have diabetes. Unfortunately, as many as one-half are unaware that they have it. Background Every cell in the human body needs energy in order to function. The body\u2019s primary energy source is glu- cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches). Glucose from the digested food circulates in the blood as a ready energy source for any cells that need it. Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell and acts like a key to open a doorway into the cell through which glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can be converted to concentrated energy sources like glycogen or fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is not enough insulin produced or when the doorway no longer recognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the blood rather entering the cells. The body will attempt to dilute the high level of glucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia, by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood- stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it in the urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnosed diabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities of water, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get rid of the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucose in the urine. At the same time that the body is trying to get rid of glucose from the blood, the cells are starving for glu- cose and sending signals to the body to eat more food, thus making patients extremely hungry. To provide energy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con- vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats and proteins for energy causes acid compounds called ketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also be excreted in the urine. As ketones build up in the blood, a condition called ketoacidosis can occur. This condi- tion can be life threatening if left untreated, leading to coma and death. Types of diabetes mellitus Type I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes, begins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. In this form of diabetes, the body produces little or no insulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occurs more frequently in populations descended from Northern European countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) than in those from Southern European countries, the Middle East, or Asia. In the United States, approximately three people in 1,000 develop Type I diabetes. This form is also called insulin-dependent diabetes because people who develop this type need to have daily injections of insulin. Brittle diabetics are a subgroup of Type I where patients have frequent and rapid swings of blood sugar levels between hyperglycemia (a condition where there is too much glucose or sugar in the blood) and hypo- glycemia (a condition where there is abnormally low lev- els of glucose or sugar in the blood). These patients may require several injections of different types of insulin during the day to keep the blood sugar level within a fair- ly normal range. The more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs in approximately 3\u20135% of Americans under 50 years of age, and increases to 10\u201315% in those over 50. More than 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type II diabetics. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset dia- betes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in people who are overweight and who do not exercise . It is also more common in people of Native American, Hispanic, and African-American descent. People who have migrat- ed to Western cultures from East India, Japan, and Aus- tralian Aboriginal cultures are also more likely to devel- op Type II diabetes than those who remain in their origi- nal countries. Type II is considered a milder form of diabetes because of its slow onset (sometimes developing over the course of several years) and because it can usually be controlled with diet and oral medication. The conse- quences of uncontrolled and untreated Type II diabetes, however, are the just as serious as those for Type I. This form is also called noninsulin-dependent diabetes, a term that is somewhat misleading. Many people with Type II diabetes can control the condition with diet and oral medications, however, insulin injections are sometimes necessary if treatment with diet and oral medication is not working. Another form of diabetes called gestational dia- betes can develop during pregnancy and generally resolves after the baby is delivered. This diabetic condi- tion develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy in about 2% of pregnancies. The condition is usually treated by diet, however, insulin injections may GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1048 Diabetes mellitus",

Maureen Haggerty Diabetic ketoacidosis Definition Diabetic ketoacidosis is a dangerous complication of diabetes mellitus in which the chemical balance of the body becomes far too acidic. Description Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) always results from a severe insulin deficiency. Insulin is the hormone secret- ed by the body to lower the blood sugar levels when they become too high. Diabetes mellitus is the disease resulting from the inability of the body to produce or respond properly to insulin, required by the body to convert glucose to energy. In childhood diabetes, DKA complications represent the leading cause of death , mostly due to the accumulation of abnormally large amounts of fluid in the brain (cerebral edema ). DKA combines three major features: hyperglycemia, mean- ing excessively high blood sugar kevels hyperketone- mia, meaning an overproduction of ketones by the body; and acidosis, meaning that the blood has become too acidic. Insulin deficiency is responsible for all three condi- tions: the body glucose goes largely unused since most cells are unable to transport glucose into the cell without the presence of insulin; this condition makes the body use stored fat as an alternative source instead of the unavailable glucose for energy, a process that produces acidic ketones, which build up because they require insulin to be broken down. The presence of excess ketones in the bloodstream in turn causes the blood to become more acidic than the body tissues, which creates a toxic condition. Causes and symptoms DKA is most commonly seen in individuals with type I diabetes, under 19 years of age and is usually caused by the interruption of their insulin treatment or by acute infection or trauma. A small number of people with type II diabetes also experience ketoacidosis, but this is rare given the fact that type II diabetics still pro- duce some insulin naturally. When DKA occurs in type II patients, it is usually caused by a decrease in food intake and an increased insulin deficiency due to hyper- glycemia. Some common DKA symptoms include: \u2022 high blood sugar levels \u2022 frequent urination (polyuria) and thirst \u2022 fatigue and lethargy \u2022 nausea \u2022 vomiting \u2022 abdominal pain \u2022 fruity odor to breath \u2022 rapid, deep breathing \u2022 muscle stiffness or aching \u2022 coma Diagnosis Diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyper- glycemia, hyperketonemia, and acidosis. DKA is estab- lished if the patient\u2019s urine or blood is strongly positive for glucose and ketones. Normal glucose levels in a non- diabetic person on average range from 80\u2013110 mg/dl. A person with diabetes will typically fluctuate outside those parameters. DKA glucose levels exceed 250 mg/dl and can reach 400 to 800 mg/dL. A low serum bicarbon- ate level (usually below 15 mEq/L) is also present, indicative of acidosis. A blood test or urinalysis can quickly determine the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream. Test strips are available to patients commercially can sub- merge in urine to detect the presence or concentration of ketones. Treatment Ketoacidosis is treated under medical supervision and usually in a hospital setting.

          "content": "A diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed if there are symptoms of diabetes and a plasma glucose level of at least 11.1 mmol/L, a fasting plasma glucose level of at least 7 mmol/L; or a two-hour plasma glucose level of at least 11.1 mmol/L during an oral glucose tolerance test. Home blood glucose monitoring kits are available so patients with diabetes can monitor their own levels. A small needle or lancet is used to prick the finger and a drop of blood is collected and analyzed by a monitoring device. Some patients may test their blood glucose levels several times during a day and use this information to adjust their doses of insulin. Treatment There is currently no cure for diabetes; the condi- tion, however, can be managed so that patients can live a relatively normal life. Treatment of diabetes focuses on two goals: keeping blood glucose within normal range and preventing the development of long-term complica- tions. Careful monitoring of diet, exercise, and blood glucose levels are as important as the use of insulin or oral medications in preventing complications of diabetes. Dietary changes Diet and moderate exercise are the first treatments implemented in diabetes. For many Type II diabetics, weight loss may be an important goal in helping them to control their diabetes. A well-balanced, nutritious diet pro- vides approximately 50\u201360% of calories from carbohy- drates, approximately 10\u201320% of calories from protein, and less than 30% of calories from fat. The number of calories required by an individual depends on their age, weight, and activity level. The calorie intake also needs to be distributed over the course of the entire day so surges of glucose entering the blood system are kept to a minimum. Keeping track of the number of calories provided by different foods can become complicated, so patients are usually advised to consult a nutritionist or dietitian. An individualized, easy to manage diet plan can be set up for each patient. Both the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association recommend diets based on the use of food exchange lists. Each food exchange contains a known amount of calories in the form of pro- tein, fat, or carbohydrate. A patient\u2019s diet plan will consist of a certain number of exchanges from each food category (meat or protein, fruits, breads and starches, vegetables, and fats) to be eaten at meal times and as snacks. Patients have flexibility in choosing which foods they eat as long as they stick with the number of exchanges prescribed. For many Type II diabetics, weight loss is an impor- tant factor in controlling their condition. The food exchange system, along with a plan of moderate exer- cise, can help them lose excess weight and improve their overall health. Oral medications Oral medications are available to lower blood glucose in Type II diabetics. The drugs first prescribed for Type II diabetes are in a class of compounds called sulfonylureas and include tolbutamide, tolazamide, acetohexamide, and chlorpropamide. Newer drugs in the same class are now available and include glyburide, glimeperide, and glip- izide. The way that these drugs work is not well under- stood, however, they seem to stimulate cells of the pan- creas to produce more insulin. New medications that are available to treat diabetes include metformin, acarbose, and troglitizone. The choice of the right medication depends in part on the individual patient profile. All drugs have side effects that may make them inappropriate for particular patients. Some for example, may stimulate weight gain or cause stomach irritation, so they may not be the best treatment for someone who is already overweight or who also has stomach ulcers. While these medications are an important aspect of treatment for Type II diabetes, they are not a substitute for a well planned diet and moder- ate exercise. Oral medications are not effective for Type I diabetes, in which the patient produces little or no insulin. Insulin Patients with Type I diabetes need daily injections of insulin to help their bodies use glucose. The amount and type of insulin required depends on the height, weight, age, food intake, and activity level of the individual dia- betic patient. Some patients with Type II diabetes may need to use insulin injections if their diabetes cannot be controlled with diet, exercise, and oral medication. Injec- tions are given subcutaneously, that is, just under the skin, using a small needle and syringe. Injection sites can be anywhere on the body where there is looser skin, including the upper arm, abdomen, or upper thigh. Purified human insulin is most commonly used, however, insulin from beef and pork sources are also available. Insulin may be given as an injection of a single dose of one type of insulin once a day. Different types of insulin can be mixed and given in one dose or split into two or more doses during a day. Patients who require multiple injections over the course of a day may be able to use an insulin pump that administers small doses of insulin on demand. The small battery-operated pump is worn outside the body and is connected to a needle that is inserted into the abdomen. Pumps can be programmed to inject small doses of insulin at various times during the day, or the patient may be able to adjust the insulin doses to coincide with meals and exercise.

DI is easily confused with an entirely unrelated dis- order, psychogenic polydipsia. Polydipsia refers to drinking large amounts of water. Psychogenic polydipsia is a psychiatric problem that makes a person drink huge quantities of water uncontrollably. Symptoms of DI include extreme thirst and the pro- duction of tremendous quantities of urine. Patients with DI typically drink huge amounts of water, and usually report a specific craving for cold water. When the amount of water passed in the urine exceeds the patient\u2019s ability to drink ample replacement water, the patient may begin to suffer from symptoms of dehydration . These symp- toms include weakness, fatigue, fever, low blood pres- sure, increased heart rate, dizziness , and confusion. If left untreated, the patient could lapse into unconscious- ness and die. Diagnosis Diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with sudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami- nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made up mostly of water with no solute. Examination of the blood will reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute and low in fluid volume. A water deprivation test may be performed. This test requires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient is weighed just before the test begins, and urine is collected and examined hourly. The test is stopped when: \u2022 the patient has lost more than 5% of his or her original body weight \u2022 the patient has reached certain limits of low blood pres- sure and increased heart rate \u2022 the urine is no longer changing significantly from one sample to the next in terms of solute concentration The next step of the test involves injecting a synthet- ic form of ADH, with one last urine sample examined 60 minutes later. Comparing plasma and urine osmolality allows the doctor to diagnose either central DI, nephro- genic DI, partial DI, or psychogenic polydipsia. Treatment A number of medications can be given to decrease the quantity of fluid passed out into the urine. These include vasopressin (Pitressin) injected and desmo- pressin acetate (DDA VP) inhaled through the nose. Other medications that may be given include some antidiuretic drugs (chlorpropamide, clofibrate, carbamazepine).

Krajewski, MS, CGC Charcot\u2019s joints Definition Charcot\u2019s joints is a progressive degenerative disease of the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in the loss of ability to feel pain in the joint and instability of the joint. Description Charcot\u2019s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis- ease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint. The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint due to nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to the joint go unnoticed leading to instability and making the joint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated small injuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until finally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro- tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegration of the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint. Although this condition can affect any joint, the knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals with diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it may affect two or three joints. More than three affected joints is very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affected depends on the location of the nerve damage. Causes and symptoms Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil- ity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, spinal injuries and diseases,alcoholism, and even syphilis can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in some areas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital. The symptoms of Charcot\u2019s joints can go unnoticed for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint without the expected pain, or with less pain than would be expected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. As the condition progresses, however, the joint can become very painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths. Diagnosis Charcot\u2019s joints is suspected when a person with a disease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painless swelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays will show damage to the joint, and may also show abnormal bone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag- ments from previous injuries may also be visible. Treatment In the early stages of Charcot\u2019s joints, braces to sta- bilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage. When the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgery can sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten- sive, an artificial joint may be necessary. Prognosis Treatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep- tion may help to slow the damage to the joints. Prevention Preventing or effectively managing the underlying disease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage, but the condition cannot be prevented. Resources BOOKS Resnick, Donald.

          "content": "Blood tests may be useful in diagnosing fluke infections, but their usefulness is limited because of cross-reactions. A cross-reaction occurs in blood testing when a particular disease agent reacts with antibodies specific to another disease agent. This result means that the doctor may know that the person is infected by flukes but cannot tell from the blood test alone which specific type of fluke is causing the disease. In addition, blood tests for fluke infections cannot distinguish between past and current infections. In some cases, sophisticated imaging techniques, such as computed tomography scans (CT scans) or ultrasound scans of the patient\u2019s chest or brain (for lung flukes) or abdomen (for liver flukes), are useful in confirming a diagnosis of fluke infection. Treatment Liver and lung fluke infections are treated with med- ications. These include triclabendazole, praziquantel, bithionol, albendazole, and mebendazole. Praziquantel works by paralyzing the flukes\u2019 suckers, forcing them to drop away from the walls of the host\u2019s blood vessels. In the United States, bithionol is available only from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Depending on the species of fluke and the severity of infection, the course of treatment can vary from several days to several weeks. Cure rates vary from 50\u201395%. Most patients experience mild temporary side effects from these drugs, including diarrhea, dizziness, or headache. Prognosis The prognosis for recovery from liver fluke infec- tions is good, although patients with serious infections may be more vulnerable to other diseases, particularly if significant liver damage has occurred. Most patients with lung fluke infections also recover, however, severe infec- tions of the brain can cause death from the destruction of central nervous system or brain tissue. Prevention No vaccines have been developed that are effective against lung or liver fluke infections. Prevention of these infections includes the following measures: \u2022 boiling or purifying drinking water \u2022 avoiding raw or undercooked fish or salads made from fresh aquatic plants; all food eaten in areas with fluke infestations should be cooked thoroughly; pickling or smoking will not kill fluke cysts in fish or shellfish \u2022 control or eradication of the snails that serve as the flukes\u2019 intermediate hosts Resources BOOKS Goldsmith, Robert S. \u201cInfectious Diseases: Protozoal & Helminthic.\u201d Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1998. 37th ed.

Purpose Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics, medicines used to treat infections caused by microorganisms. Physicians prescribe these drugs for bacterial infections in many parts of the body. For example, they are used to treat bone and joint infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, inflammation of the prostate, serious ear infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, some sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and some infec- tions that affect people with AIDS. Description Fluoroquinolones are available only with a physi- cian\u2019s prescription and are sold in tablet and injectable forms.

          "content": "There are many possible causes of FUO; generally though, a diagnosis can be found. About 10% of patients will wind up without a definite cause, and about the same percentage have \u201cfactitious fevers\u201d (either self induced or no fever at all). Some general symptoms tend to occur along with fever; these are called constitutional symptoms and con- sist of myalgias (muscle aches), chills, and headache. Diagnosis Few symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos- tic challenge as fever. Nonetheless, if a careful, logical, and thorough evaluation is performed, a diagnosis will be found in most cases. The patient\u2019s past medical history as well as travel, social, and family history should be care- fully searched for important clues. Usually the first step is to search for an infectious cause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such as tuberculosis, and examination of blood, urine, and stool, are generally indicated. Antibody levels to a number of infectious agents can be measured; if these are rising, they may point to an active infection. Various x-ray studies are also of value. In addition to standard examinations, recently developed radiological techniques using ultrasound, computed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) scans are now available. These enable physicians to examine areas that were once accessible only through surgery. Fur- thermore, new studies using radioactive materials (nuclear medicine), can detect areas of infection and inflammation previously almost impossible to find, even with surgery. Biopsies of any suspicious areas found on an x-ray exam can be performed by either traditional or newer surgical techniques. Material obtained by biopsy is then examined by a pathologist to look for clues as to the cause of the fever. Evidence of infection, tumor or other diseases can be found in this way. Portions of the biopsy are also sent to the laboratory for culture in an attempt to grow and identify an infectious organism. Patients with HIV are an especially difficult prob- lem, as they often suffer from many unusual infections. HIV itself is a potential cause of fever. Treatment Most patients who undergo evaluation for FUO do not receive treatment until a clear-cut cause is found. Antibi- otics or medications designed to suppress a fever (such as NSAIDs) will only hide the true cause. Once physicians are satisfied that there is no infectious cause, they may use med- ications such as NSAIDs, or corticosteroids to decrease inflammation and diminish constitutional symptoms. The development of FUO in certain settings, such as that acquired by patients in the hospital or in those with a low white blood count , often needs rapid treatment to avoid serious complications. Therefore, in these instances patients may be placed on antibiotics after a minimal number of diagnostic studies. Once test results are known, treatment can be adjusted as needed. Prognosis The outlook for patients with FUO depends on the cause of the fever. If the basic illness is easily treatable and can be found rather quickly, the potential for a cure is quite good. Some patients continue with temperature elevations for six months or more; if no serious disease is found, medications such as NSAIDs are used to decrease the effects of the fever. Careful follow-up and reevalua- tion is recommended in these cases. Resources BOOKS Gelfand, Jeffrey A., and Charles A.

The patient experiences difficulty breathing and has a fever, chest pain, and other signs of pneumonia. Medical treat- ment is essential for recovery. In its disseminated form, coccidioidomycosis spreads to other parts of the body including the liver, bones, skin, brain, heart, and lining around the heart (pericardium). Symptoms include fever, joint pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, night sweats, skin lesions , and difficulty breathing. Also, in 30\u201350% of patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis, the tissue coverings of the brain and spinal cord become inflamed (meningitis). Diagnosis Many cases of coccidioidomycosis go undiagnosed because the symptoms resemble those of common viral diseases. However, a skin test similar to that for tubercu- losis will determine whether a person has been infected. The test is simple and accurate, but it does not indicate whether the disease was limited to its acute form or if it has progressed to its chronic form. Diagnosis of chronic or disseminated coccidioidomy- cosis is made by culturing a sample of sputum or other body fluids in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. A blood serum test is used to detect the presence of an antibody pro- duced in response to C. immitis infection. Chest x rays are often used to assess lung damage, but alone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis because other diseases can produce similar results on the x ray. Treatment In most cases of acute coccidioidomycosis, the body\u2019s own immune system is adequate to bring about recovery without medical intervention. Fever and pain can be treated with non-prescription drugs. Chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis, how- ever, are serious diseases that require treatment with pre- scription drugs. Patients with intact immune systems who develop chronic coccidiodomycosis are treated with the drug ketoconazole (Nizoral) or amphotericin B (Fungi- zone). Patients with suppressed immune systems are treat- ed with amphotericin B (Fungizone). Amphotericin B is a powerful fungistatic drug with potentially toxic side effects. As a result, hospitalization is required in order to monitor patients. The patient may also receive other drugs to minimize the side effects of the amphotericin B. Patients with AIDS must continue to take itracona- zole (Sporonox) or fluconazole (Diflucan) orally or receive weekly intravenous doses of amphotericin B for the rest of their lives in order to prevent a relapse.

Patients needing this drug should ask their doctors about this program. Alternative treatment Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuses on creating an internal environment where the fungus cannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet low in dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice, and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple- mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncooked and unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E, A-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the good bacteria in the intestines.

          "content": "and fever occur in about one in five patients. The dis- ease runs its course in about 10 days. A number of other illnesses have been attributed to enteroviruses, including pneumonia and other respirato- ry infections, myositis or muscle inflammation, arthritis, and acute inflammation of the kidneys. It is clear then that these viruses produce a number of various illnesses, most often in younger age groups. Diagnosis In the majority of cases, diagnosis is based on the characteristic symptoms that the virus produces (such as the chest pain in pleurodynia). Rarely is it necessary to identify a specific strain of virus causing the illness. It is more important to be certain that the infection is due to a virus which does not require treatment with antibiotics. Culture, or growing the organism outside of the body, is helpful only when obtained from areas that tend to indi- cate recent infection, such as from swollen joints, cere- brospinal fluid, or blood. Cultures from other areas, such as the throat, can be misleading. This is because the virus may remain for long periods of time in places with a large amount of lymphatic tissue. As a rule, cultures done early in the illness are more likely to identify the virus. New techniques that involve identification of viral genetic material (PCR) are useful in certain cases, but are not indicated for routine testing. Treatment As noted above, enterovirus is capable of attacking many different organs and producing a variety of symp- toms. Most infections are mild and improve without complications, and require no specific therapy. When the virus attacks critical organs however, such as the heart, respiratory muscles, nervous system, etc., then special- ized care is often needed. As of 2001, no effective antiviral medication for enterovirus has undergone investigation in patients, though some drugs appear promising for the future. In some patients who are unable to produce antibodies (hypogammaglobunemia), administrating antibodies themselves is helpful. Prognosis The overall outlook for enterovirus infection depends on the organs involved, and the immune condi- tion of the individual patient.

Prevention In the hospital setting, the best means of avoiding transmission of infection is the use of good hand-wash- ing practices and other appropriate precautions (gowns and gloves for hospital staff). The virus is found in feces for up to one week after infection; therefore precautions that isolate waste material (enteric precautions) will help decrease the chance of spreading the illness.

David Kaminstein, MD Cancer Definition Cancer is not just one disease, but a large group of almost one hundred diseases. Its two main characteristics are uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human body and the ability of these cells to migrate from the original site and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not con- trolled, cancer can result in death. Description One out of every four deaths in the United States is from cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a cause of death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 die of cancer annually. Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of cancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases are seen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent of all cancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65 years of age. The most common cancers are skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer , breast cancer (in women), and prostate cancer (in men). In addition, cancer of the kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, and blood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lym- phomas) are also included among the 12 major cancers that affect most Americans.

In acute infection, the patient may be tired, have a low-grade fever, pains in the joints, a swollen liver, abdominal pain, and a skin rash. The acute syndrome may be difficult to diagnose because the fluke eggs do not appear in the patient\u2019s stool for three to four weeks after infection. Patients with the chronic form of the disease experience a loss of appetite,fatigue, low-grade fever,diarrhea, and an enlarged liver that feels sore when the abdomen is pressed. Paragonimiasis Paragonimiasis is caused by a lung fluke, either Paragonimus westermanior P . skrjabini. These flukes are larger than liver flukes and infect meat- or fish-eating ani- mals as well as humans. Their life cycle is similar to that of liver flukes except that their encysted larvae infect crabs and crayfish rather than plants or fish. Humans can ingest the encysted metacercariae from drinking contaminated water or eating raw or undercooked crabs and crayfish. In humans, the metacercariae are released from their cysts in the small intestine and migrate to the lungs or the brain in 1% of cases. In the lungs, the flukes lay their eggs and form areas of inflammation covered with a thin layer of fibrous tissue. These areas of infection may eventually rupture, causing the patient to cough up fluke eggs, blood, and inflamed tissue.

Patients with lung infections may have chest pain and fever as well as rust- colored or bloody sputum. Lung infections can lead to lung abscess , pneumonia , or bronchitis . Patients with fluke infections of the brain may experience seizures or a fatal inflammation of brain tissue called encephalitis . Some patients also develop diarrhea and abdominal pain or lumps under the skin that contain adult flukes. Diagnosis Diagnosis of fluke infections is based on a combina- tion of the patient\u2019s history, particularly travel or resi- dence in areas known to have flukes, and identification of the fluke\u2019s eggs or adult forms. In some patients, the eggs are found in fluid from the lungs, bile duct, or small intestine. Samples of these fluids can be obtained with a suction instrument (aspirator). Because most types of fluke infections are rare in the United States, stool speci- mens or body fluid samples may need to be sent to a lab- oratory with experts in unusual diseases or conditions to identify the specific parasite. In some cases, adult flukes may be found in the patient\u2019s stools, vomit, sputum, or skin lumps (for lung flukes). In the case of lung flukes, it is important for the doctor to rule out tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis. A tuberculosis skin test and chest x ray will usually be sufficient to do this.

          "content": "species of parasitic flatworms (Trematodes) that have complex life cycles involving hosts other than human beings. Trematode comes from a Greek word that means having holes and refers to the external suckers that adult flukes use to draw nourishment from their hosts. Fluke infections are contracted by eating uncooked fish, plants, or animals from fluke-infected waters. Symptoms vary according to the type of fluke infection. Description In humans, fluke infections can be classified accord- ing to those diseases caused by liver flukes and those caused by lung flukes. Diseases caused by liver flukes include fascioliasis, opisthorchiasis, and clonorchiasis. Cases of liver fluke infection have been reported in Europe and the United States, as well as the Middle East, China, Japan, and Africa. Diseases caused by lung flukes include paragonimiasis. Paragonimiasis is a common infection in the Far East, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and South America, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. It is estimated that between 40 million and 100 million people worldwide suffer from either liver or lung fluke infections. In their adult stage, liver and lung flukes are sym- metrical in shape, ranging between 1/4\u20131 in in length, and look somewhat like long, plump leaves or blades of grass. They enter through the mouth and can infect any person at any age. Causes and symptoms The symptoms of fluke infection differ somewhat according to the type of fluke involved. All forms of liver and lung fluke infection, however, have the following characteristics: \u2022 most persons who get infected do not develop symp- toms (asymptomatic) \u2022 the early symptoms of an acute fluke infection are not unique to these diseases alone (nonspecific symptoms) \u2022 infection does not confer immunity against re-infection by the same species or infection by other species of flukes \u2022 infection is usually associated with eating uncooked fish, plants, or animals that live in fresh water Fascioliasis Fascioliasis is caused by Fasciola hepatica , the sheep liver fluke. The fluke has a three-part life cycle that begins when eggs from a host\u2019s feces are deposited in water. The eggs release free-swimming larvae (miracidia) that infect snails. The snails then release free- swimming larvae with tails (cercariae) that form cysts containing larvae in the infective stage (metacercariae) on vegetation growing in fresh water. Humans become infected when they eat watercress, water chestnuts, or other plants covered with the encysted metacercariae. When a person eats contaminated plants, the cysts are broken open in the digestive system, and the metacer- cariae leave their cysts, pass through the wall of the intestine, and enter the liver, where they cause inflamma- tion and destroy tissue. After a period of 10\u201315 weeks in the liver, the adult flukes move to the bile ducts and pro- duce eggs. Acute fascioliasis is marked by abdominal pain with headache, loss of appetite, anemia, and vomit- ing. Some patients develop hives, muscle pains, or a yel- low-color to the skin and whites of the eyes ( jaundice). Chronic forms of the disease may produce complica- tions, including blockage of the bile ducts or the migra- tion of adult flukes to other parts of the body. Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis These infections are caused by Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, and Opisthorchis viverrini or O. felineus . The diseases are widespread, affecting more than 20 million people in Japan, China, Southeast Asia, and India. The life cycle of these liver flukes is similar to that of F . hepaticaexcept that the etacercariae are encyst- ed in freshwater fish rather than on plants. Dogs, cats, and other mammals that eat raw fish can be infected with opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis.

An important aspect of treatment with flower remedies, is that if you feel instinc- tively that you need a particular remedy, you are encour- aged to act on that instinct. However, it is advisable not to continue a particular remedy once you feel you no longer need it, and to try a different one if you feel that progress is not being made. The remedies are administered from a stoppered bottle and need to be diluted. Individuals sensitive to alcohol can apply the concentrate directly to temples, wrists, behind the ears, or underarms. They should be kept in a cool dark place; like this they should last indef- initely. However, a diluted remedy should not be kept longer than three weeks. Two drops of each diluted rem- edy should be taken four times a day, including first thing in the morning and last thing at night. If the rescue remedy is being used, four drops should be used instead. Most therapists recommend that they be taken in spring water, but the remedy can be taken directly from the bot- tle, if care is taken that the dropper does not touch the tongue, as this would introduce bacteria that would spoil the remedy. It is not recommended that more than six or seven Bach remedies be used at any one time. Instead, it is preferable to divide a larger amount up into two lots to ensure the optimum effectiveness of the remedies. No combination, or amount of combinations of the remedies can cause any harm, rather they become less effective. Unlike FES, the Bach Centre does not encourage research to \u201cprove\u201d that the remedies work, preferring that people find out for themselves. They strive to keep the use of the Bach remedies as simple as possible, and to this end they do not keep case records. Bach warned before he died that others would try to change his work and make it more complicated. He was determined to keep it simple so that anyone could use it, and that is why he limited the system to only 38 remedies. The Centre points out that many who have used Bach\u2019s research as a starting point have added other remedies to the list, even some that Bach himself rejected. Side effects Flower remedies or essences are generally regarded as being totally safe, and there are no known side effects apart from the rare appearance of a slight rash, which is not a rea- son to discontinue treatment, says the Bach Centre.

          "content": "of arthritis and various injuries to the arm and wrist (including fractures, sprains, and dislocations). Further- more, activities which cause an individual to repeatedly bend the wrist inward toward the forearm can predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome. Certain jobs which require repeated strong wrist motions carry a relatively high risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Injuries of this type are referred to as \u201crepetitive motion\u201d injuries, and are more frequent among secretaries doing a lot of typing, people working at computer keyboards or cash registers, factory workers, and some musicians. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb- ness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like sensation over the palm surface of the hand, and into the thumb, forefinger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger. Some individuals notice a shooting pain which goes from the wrist up the arm, or down into the hand and fingers. With continued median nerve compression, an individual may begin to experience muscle weakness, making it dif- ficult to open jars and hold objects with the affected hand. Eventually, the muscles of the hand served by the median nerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller (atrophy), especially the fleshy part of the thumb. Untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome may eventually result in permanent weakness, loss of sensation, or even paral- ysis of the thumb and fingers of the affected hand. Diagnosis The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made in part by checking to see whether the patient\u2019s symptoms can be brought on by holding his or her hand in position with wrist bent for about a minute. Wrist x rays are often taken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pres- sure on the median nerve. A physician examining a patient suspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome will perform a variety of simple tests to measure muscle strength and sen- sation in the affected hand and arm. Further testing might include electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity testing to determine the exact severity of nerve damage. These tests involve stimulating the median nerve with electricity and measuring the resulting speed and strength of the muscle response, as well as recording speed of nerve transmission across the carpel tunnel. Treatment Carpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with splints, which support the wrist and prevent it from flex- ing inward into the position which exacerbates median nerve compression. Some people get significant relief by wearing such splints to sleep at night, while others will need to wear the splints all day, especially if they are per- forming jobs which stress the wrist. Ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be pre- scribed to decrease pain and swelling. When carpal tun- nel syndrome is more advanced, injection of steroids into the wrist to decrease inflammation may be necessary. The most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome may require surgery to decrease the compression of the median nerve and restore its normal function. Such a repair involves cutting that ligament which crosses the wrist, thus allowing the median nerve more room and decreasing compression. This surgery is done almost exclusively on an outpatient basis and is often performed without the patient having to be made unconscious. Care- ful injection of numbing medicines (local anesthesia) or nerve blocks (the injection of anesthetics directly into the nerve) create sufficient numbness to allow the surgery to be performed painlessly, without the risks associated with general anesthesia. Recovery from this type of surgery is usually quick and without complications.

Most people are able to control the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome with splinting and anti-inflammatory agents.

Most suffer- ers experience only moderate discomfort and find that their symptoms clear up without any lasting harm after a few weeks or months. Professional medical treatment is rarely needed. Description Cat-scratch disease (also called cat-scratch fever) is caused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium, which is found in cats around the world and is transmitted from cat to cat by fleas. Researchers have discovered that large numbers of North American cats carry antibodies for the disease (meaning that the cats have been infected at some point in their lives). Some parts of North America have much higher rates of cat infection than others, however. Bartonella henselae is uncommon or absent in cold cli- mates, which fleas have difficulty tolerating, but preva- lent in warm, humid places such as Memphis, Tennessee, where antibodies were found in 71% of the cats tested. The bacterium, which remains in a cat\u2019s bloodstream for several months after infection, seems to be harmless to most cats, and normally an infected cat will not display any symptoms. Kittens (cats less than one year old) are more likely than adult cats to be carrying the infection. Bartonella henselae can infect people who are scratched or (more rarely) bitten or licked by a cat. It cannot be passed from person to person. Although cats are popular pets found in about 30% of American house- holds, human infection appears to be rare. One study estimated that for every 100,000 Americans there are only 2.5 cases of cat-scratch disease each year (2.5/ 100,000). It is also unusual for more than one family member to become ill; a Florida investigation discovered multiple cases in only 3.5% of the families studied.

Krajewski, MS, CGC Charcot\u2019s joints Definition Charcot\u2019s joints is a progressive degenerative disease of the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in the loss of ability to feel pain in the joint and instability of the joint. Description Charcot\u2019s joints, also called neuropathic joint dis- ease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint. The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint due to nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries to the joint go unnoticed leading to instability and making the joint more susceptible to further injury. Repeated small injuries, strains and even fractures can go unnoticed until finally the joint is permanently destroyed. Loss of the pro- tective sensation of pain is what leads to the disintegration of the joint and often leads to deformity in the joint. Although this condition can affect any joint, the knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals with diabetes mellitus , the foot is most commonly affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it may affect two or three joints. More than three affected joints is very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s) affected depends on the location of the nerve damage. Causes and symptoms Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the abil- ity to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, spinal injuries and diseases,alcoholism, and even syphilis can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in some areas. Lack of pain sensation may also be congenital. The symptoms of Charcot\u2019s joints can go unnoticed for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a joint without the expected pain, or with less pain than would be expected, are the primary symptoms of this condition. As the condition progresses, however, the joint can become very painful due to fluid build-up and bony growths. Diagnosis Charcot\u2019s joints is suspected when a person with a disease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painless swelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays will show damage to the joint, and may also show abnormal bone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone frag- ments from previous injuries may also be visible. Treatment In the early stages of Charcot\u2019s joints, braces to sta- bilize the joints can help stop or minimize the damage. When the disease has progressed beyond braces, surgery can sometimes repair the joint. If the damage is exten- sive, an artificial joint may be necessary. Prognosis Treatment of the disease causing loss of pain percep- tion may help to slow the damage to the joints. Prevention Preventing or effectively managing the underlying disease can slow or in some cases reverse joint damage, but the condition cannot be prevented. Resources BOOKS Resnick, Donald.

About 30\u201350% of all children with Down syn- drome are found to have heart defects. A number of dif- ferent heart defects are common in Down syndrome, including abnormal openings (holes) in the walls that separate the heart\u2019s chambers (atrial septal defect, ven- tricular septal defect). These result in abnormal patterns of blood flow within the heart. The abnormal blood flow often means that less oxygen is sent into circulation throughout the body. Another heart defect that occurs in Down syndrome is called Tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot consists of a hole in the heart, along with three other major heart defects. Malformations of the gastrointestinal tract are pre- sent in about 5\u20137% of children with Down syndrome. The most common malformation is a narrowed, obstruct- ed duodenum (the part of the intestine into which the stomach empties). This disorder, called duodenal atresia, interferes with the baby\u2019s milk or formula leaving the stomach and entering the intestine for digestion. The baby often vomits forcibly after feeding, and cannot gain weight appropriately until the defect is repaired. Other medical conditions that occur in patients with Down syndrome include an increased chance of develop- ing infections, especially ear infections and pneumonia; certain kidney disorders; thyroid disease (especially low or hypothyroid); hearing loss; vision impairment requir- ing glasses (corrective lenses); and a 20-times greater chance of developing leukemia (a blood disorder). Development in a baby and child with Down syn- drome occurs at a much slower than normal rate. Because of weak, floppy muscles (hypotonia), babies learn to sit up, crawl, and walk much later than their nor- mal peers. Talking is also quite delayed. The level of mental retardation is considered to be mild-to-moderate in Down syndrome. The actual IQ range of Down syn- drome children is quite varied, but the majority of such children are in what is sometimes known as the trainable range. This means that most people with Down syn- drome can be trained to do regular self-care tasks, func- tion in a socially appropriate manner in a normal home environment, and even hold simple jobs. As people with Down syndrome age, they face an increased chance of developing the brain disease called Alzheimer\u2019s (sometimes referred to as dementia or senility). Most people have a six in 100 risk of develop- ing Alzheimer\u2019s, but people with Down syndrome have a 25 in 100 chance of the disease. Alzheimer\u2019s disease causes the brain to shrink and to break down. The num- ber of brain cells decreases, and abnormal deposits and structural arrangements occur. This process results in a loss of brain functioning. People with Alzheimer\u2019s have strikingly faulty memories. Over time, people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease will lapse into an increasingly unre- sponsive state. Some researchers have shown that even Down syndrome patients who do not appear to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease have the same changes occurring to the structures and cells of their brains. As people with Down syndrome age, they also have an increased chance of developing a number of other ill- nesses, including cataracts, thyroid problems, diabetes, and seizure disorders. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually suspected at birth, when the characteristic physical signs of Down syndrome are noted. Once this suspicion has been raised, genetic test- ing (chromosome analysis) can be undertaken in order to verify the presence of the disorder. This testing is usually done on a blood sample, although chromosome analysis can also be done on other types of tissue, including skin. The cells to be studied are prepared in a laboratory. Chemical stain is added to make the characteristics of the cells and the chromosomes stand out. Chemicals are added to prompt the cells to go through normal develop- ment, up to the point where the chromosomes are most visible, prior to cell division. At this point, they are examined under a microscope and photographed. The photograph is used to sort the different sizes and shapes of chromosomes into pairs. In most cases of Down syn- drome, one extra chromosome 21 will be revealed. The final result of such testing, with the photographed chro- mosomes paired and organized by shape and size, is called the individual\u2019s karyotype.

Dorothy Elinor Stonely Carpal tunnel syndrome Definition Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disorder caused by compression at the wrist of the median nerve supplying the hand, causing numbness and tingling. Description The carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the bones and ligaments create a small passageway for the median nerve. The median nerve is responsible for both sensation and movement in the hand, in particular the thumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve is compressed, an individual\u2019s hand will feel as if it has \u201cgone to sleep.\u201d Women between the ages of 30 and 60 have the highest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research has demonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very sig- nificant cause of missed work days due to pain. In 1995, about $270 million was spent on sick days taken for pain from repetitive motion injuries. Causes and symptoms Compression of the median nerve in the wrist can occur during a number of different conditions, particular- ly those conditions which lead to changes in fluid accu- mulation throughout the body. Because the area of the wrist through which the median nerve passes is very nar- row, any swelling in the area will lead to pressure on the median nerve. This pressure will ultimately interfere with the nerve\u2019s ability to function normally. Pregnancy, obesity , arthritis, certain thyroid conditions, diabetes, and certain pituitary abnormalities all predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome.

Surgical procedures include: arterial switch, balloon atrial septostomy, balloon valvulo- plasty, Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, Fontan proce- dure, pulmonary artery banding, Ross procedure, shunt procedure, and venous switch or intra-atrial baffle. Arterial switch, to correct transposition of the great arteries, involves connecting the aorta to the left ventricle and connecting the pulmonary artery to the right ventri- cle. Balloon atrial septostomy, also done to correct trans- position of the great arteries, enlarges the atrial opening during heart catheterization. Balloon valvuloplasty uses a balloon-tipped catheter to open a narrowed heart valve, improving the flow of blood in pulmonary stenosis. It is sometimes used in aortic stenosis. Transposition of the great arteries can also be corrected by the Damus-Kaye- Stansel procedure, in which the pulmonary artery is cut in two and connected to the ascending aorta and the far- thest section of the right ventricle. For tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia, the Fontan procedure connects the right atrium to the pul- monary artery directly or with a conduit, and the atrial defect is closed. Pulmonary artery banding, narrowing the pulmonary artery with a band to reduce blood flow and pressure in the lungs, is used for ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal defect, and tricuspid atresia. Later, the band can be removed and the defect corrected with open-heart surgery. To correct aortic stenosis, the Ross procedure grafts the pulmonary artery to the aorta. For tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, or pulmonary atresia, the shunt proce- dure creates a passage between blood vessels, sending blood into parts of the body that need it. For transposi- tion of the great arteries, venous switch creates a tunnel inside the atria to re-direct oxygen-rich blood to the right ventricle and aorta and venous blood to the left ventricle and pulmonary artery. When all other options fail, some patients may need a heart transplant. Children with congenital heart disease require lifelong monitoring, even after successful surgery. The American Heart Association recommends regular dental check-ups and the preventive use of antibiotics to protect patients from heart infections, or endocarditis . Since children with congenital heart dis- ease have slower growth, nutrition is important. Physi- cians may also limit their athletic activity. Prognosis The outlook for children with congenital heart dis- ease has improved markedly in the past two decades. Many types of congenital heart disease that would have been fatal can now be treated successfully. Research on diagnosing heart defects when the fetus is in the womb may lead to future treatment to correct defects before birth. Promising new prevention methods and treatments include genetic screening and the cultivation of cardiac tissue in the laboratory that could be used to repair con- genital heart defects.

Frey Famine fever see Relapsing fever Fanconi\u2019s syndrome Definition Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor- ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc- tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal- cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the body. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth. Description Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body needs in the blood and putting what the body doesn\u2019t need into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is performed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered through a kidney structure with small holes that keep the cells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of the small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body, are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome. As a consequence, substances that are normally reabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins, water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and phosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn- drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular syndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debr\u00e9-Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi\u2019s anemia is, however, a totally different disease. Causes and symptoms Causes Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be caused by a variety of genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults. The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause in children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease, hereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome, Wilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease, vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome. Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium, lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like outdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances (like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine taken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans- plantation. Symptoms Fanconi\u2019s syndrome symptoms related directly to impaired absorption include excessive urine production and urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa- tion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu- cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and protein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels of phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively acidic blood. The most noticeable indirect consequences of impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and osteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated with bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty walking. If a person acquires Fanconi\u2019s syndrome as an adult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is accompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac- tures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and occasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of the ineffective reabsorption. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be made by urine and blood tests. It is also important to find the underlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Other symptoms specific to a particular patient will point to other useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290 Fanconi\u2019s syndrome",

Richard Robinson Electronic fetal monitoring Definition Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for examining the condition of a baby in the uterus by noting any unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni- toring is performed late in pregnancyor continuously dur- ing labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFM can be utilized either externally or internally in the womb. Purpose The heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust- ment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli. The fetal monitor records an unborn baby\u2019s heart rate and graphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoring is usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when the baby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFM include: babies in a breech position, premature labor , and induced labor, among others. When electronic fetal monitoring was originally introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that it would help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lack of oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birth asphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn deaths. It occurs when there are less than normal amounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ and there is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue. A lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia. Perinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth, shortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If the interruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the baby may recover without any damage. If the time is longer, there may be some injury that is reversible. If the time period without oxygen is very long, there may be perma- nent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor- tant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible. One of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm in the unborn baby, which can be detected by electronic fetal monitoring. The fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the machine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby\u2019s heartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits just picks up the sound of the baby\u2019s heart beating. The fetal monitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heart rate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con- tractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps the doctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling the stress of contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby\u2019s heartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then go back to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks for any changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there is a drastic drop in the baby\u2019s heart beat or if the heart rate does not recover immediately after a contraction. Because it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When an adult complains to a provider about not feeling well, checking the heart rate is only one of many things that the doctor will do. With an unborn baby, however, check- ing the heart rate is basically the only thing that a doctor or midwife can do. Fetal monitoring can be helpful in a variety of differ- ent situations. During pregnancy, fetal monitoring can be used as a part of antepartum testing .

Fetal monitoring Fetal monitoring is a process in which the baby\u2019s heart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during labor and birth. There are several types of fetal monitoring. A special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be used. This is a simple and non-invasive method. The Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves a handheld listening device that transmits the sounds of the heart rate through a speaker or into an attached ear piece. It can usually pick up the heart sounds 12 weeks after conception. This method offers intermittent monitoring. It allows the mother freedom to move about and is also useful during contractions. Electronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and provides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to the mother\u2019s contractions. It can be used either continuously or intermittently. It is often used in high risk pregnan- cies, and is not often recommended for low risk ones KEY TERMS Amniotic sac \u2014The membranous sac that sur- rounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid as pregnancy advances. Breech birth\u2014Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead of the usual head first delivery. This can add to labor and delivery problems because the baby\u2019s bottom doesn\u2019t mold a passage through the birth canal as well as does the head. Cervix\u2014A small cylindrical organ about an inch or so long and less than an inch around that makes up the lower part and neck of the uterus. The cervix separates the body and cavity of the uterus from the vagina. Embryo\u2014The unborn child during the first eight weeks of its development following conception. Gestation \u2014The period from conception to birth, during which the developing fetus is carried in the uterus. Perineum\u2014The area between the thighs that lies behind the genital organs and in front of the anus. Placenta \u2014The organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and that links the blood supplies of mother and baby. because it renders the mother immobile and requires interpretation. Internal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is more accurate than electronic monitoring and provides continu- ous monitoring for the high risk mother. This requires the mother\u2019s water to be broken and that she be two to three centimeters dilated. It is used in high-risk situations only. Telemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitor- ing. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrument on the mother\u2019s thigh. The mother is able to remain mobile. It provides continuous monitoring and is used in high-risk situations. Treatment Most women choose some type of pain relief during childbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to drugs. The specific choice may depend on what\u2019s available, the woman\u2019s preferences, her doctor\u2019s recommendations, and how the labor is proceeding. All drugs have some risks and some advantages. Regional anesthetics Regional anesthetics include epidurals and spinals. In this technique, medication is injected into the space around the spinal nerves. Depending on the type of med- ications used, this type of anesthesia can block nerve sig- nals, causing temporary pain relief, or a loss of sensation from the waist down. An epidural or spinal block can provide complete pain relief during cesarean birth. An epidural is placed with the woman lying on her side or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to allow more space between the vertebrae. Her back is scrubbed with antiseptic, and a local anesthetic is injected in the skin to numb the site. The needle is inserted between two vertebrae and through the tough tissue in front of the spinal column. A catheter is put in place that allows con- tinuous doses of anesthetic to be given. This type of anesthesia provides complete pain relief, and can help conserve a woman\u2019s energy, since she can relax or even sleep during labor. This type of anes- thesia does require an IV and fetal monitor. It may be harder for a woman to bear down when it comes time to push, although the amount of anesthesia can be adjusted as this stage nears. Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle as epidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of c- section delivery. It is administered in the same way as an epidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The amount of anesthetic injected is large, since it must be injected at one time. Because of the anesthetic\u2019s effect on motor nerves, most women using it cannot push during delivery. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 760 Childbirth",

Electrophysiology study of the heart Definition An electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a nonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system (normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car- diac catheters and sophisticated computers to generate electrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea- surements with exquisite precision from within the heart chambers. The EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic purposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca- tion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunction with a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation. The test is simple, not painful, and performed in a special laboratory under controlled clinical circum- stances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize in electrophysiology. Purpose A cardiologist may recommend an EP study when the standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress test, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide enough information to evaluate an abnormal heart rhythm, called an arrhythmia. An EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a suspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptoms of an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detected from other tests. The purpose and great value of an EP study is that it offers more detailed information to the doctor about the electrical activity in the heart than the aforementioned noninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directly on heart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to determine the specific location of an arrhythmia and, oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. This corrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure, and, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heart medications. EP studies may be helpful in assessing: \u2022 certain tachycardias or bradycardias of unknown cause. \u2022 patients who have been resuscitated after experiencing sudden cardiac death. \u2022 various symptoms of unknown cause, such as chest pain, shortness of breath , fatigue, or syncope (dizzi- ness/fainting). \u2022 response to anti-arrhythmic therapy. Precautions Pregnant patients should not undergo an EP study because of exposure to radiation during the study, which may be harmful to the growing baby. Patients who have coronary artery disease may need to have that treated before having an EP study. Description The rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is essentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulses traveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham- bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which are specialized cells situated in the top right chamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SA node, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generates the impulses, which travel through specific pathways throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node. The A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses to more specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottom chambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathways become damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path- ways exist, the heart\u2019s rhythm may be altered (perhaps too slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriously affect the heart\u2019s pumping ability. The patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP lab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets are placed over him or her. A minimum of two catheters are inserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groin area. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the number of catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heart may vary. For certain tachycardias, two more catheters may be inserted in the left groin and one in the internal jugular (neck) vein or in the subclavian (below the clavi- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1163 Electrophysiology study of the heart",

          "content": "feels that a baby may be at increased risk of problems toward the end of pregnancy, a baby can be checked every week or every other week with a non-stress test. In this test, changes in the baby\u2019s heart rate are measured along with the fetus\u2019 own movements. The heart rate of a healthy baby should go up whenever she or he moves. Fetal monitoring is used on and off during early labor. As labor progresses, more monitoring is often needed. Usually, as the time for delivery nears, the moni- tor is left on continuously since the end of labor tends to be the most stressful time for the baby. A baby who is having trouble in labor will show char- acteristic changes in heart rate after a contraction (late decelerations). If a baby is not receiving enough oxygen to withstand the stress of labor and delivery is many hours away, a cesarean section(C-section) may be necessary. Description Using the external fetal monitor is simple and painless. Two elastic belts are placed around the mother\u2019s abdomen. One belt holds a listening device in place while the other belt holds the contraction monitor. The nurse or midwife adjusts the belts to get the best readings from each device. Sometimes, it is difficult to hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat with the external monitoring device. Other times, the monitor may show subtle signs of a developing problem. In either case, the doctor or midwife may recommend that the external belt be replaced with an internal monitor. The internal monitor is an electronic wire that rests directly on the baby\u2019s head. The provider can place it on the baby\u2019s head during an internal exam. The internal monitor can only be used when the cervix is already open. This device provides a more accurate record of the baby\u2019s heart rate. Preparation There are no special preparations needed for fetal monitoring. KEY TERMS Breech presentation \u2014Fetal position in which the buttocks come first. A cesarean section\u2014delivery of a baby through an incision in the mother\u2019s abdomen instead of through the vagina. Hypoxia\u2014An oxygen deficiency. Risks External EFM poses no direct risks to the baby. How- ever, because of being connected to the machine, the mother cannot walk around. This inactivity may prolong labor and reduce oxygen levels in the mother\u2019s blood, both of which can be detrimental to the unborn baby. Another problem is that electronic fetal monitoring seems to be associated with an increase in caesarian deliveries. There is a concern that EFM can give false alarms of distress in the baby, and that this can lead to unneeded caesarians. With internal monitoring, there is a higher risk for infec- tion. For these and other reasons, the United States Pre- ventive Services Task Force states that there is some evi- dence that using electronic fetal monitoring on low-risk women in labor might not be indicated. Many physicians, however, continue to use EFM routinely, and believe it to be of value in both low-risk and high-risk labors. Normal results An unborn baby\u2019s heart rate normally ranges from 120\u2013160 beats per minute (bpm). A baby who is receiv- ing enough oxygen through the placenta will move around. The monitor strip will show the baby\u2019s heart rate rising briefly as he/she moves (just as an adult\u2019s heart rate rises when he/she moves). The baby\u2019s monitor strip is considered to be reactive when the baby\u2019s heart rate rises at least 20 bpm above the baseline heart rate for at least 20 seconds. This must occur at least twice in a 20-minute period. A reactive heart rate tracing (also known as a reactive non-stress test) is considered a sign of the baby\u2019s well being. Abnormal results If the baby\u2019s heart rate drops very low or rises very high, this signals a serious problem. In either of these cases it is obvious that the baby is in distress and must be delivered soon. However, many babies who are having problems do not give such clear signs. During a contraction, the flow of oxygen (from the mother) through the placenta (to the baby) is temporarily stopped. It is as if the baby has to hold its breath during each contraction. Both the placenta and the baby are designed to withstand this condition. Between contrac- tions, the baby should be receiving more than enough oxygen to do well during the contraction. The first sign that a baby is not getting enough oxy- gen between contractions is often a drop in the baby\u2019s heart rate after the contraction (late deceleration). The baby\u2019s heart rate recovers to a normal level between con- tractions, only to drop again after the next contraction. This is also a more subtle sign of distress.

Guaifenesin is not meant to be used for coughs asso- ciated with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis,o r smoking. It also should not be used for coughs that are producing a large amount of mucus. A lingering cough could be a sign of a serious med- ical condition. Coughs that last more than seven days or are associated with fever, rash, sore throat , or lasting headache should have medical attention. Call a physi- cian as soon as possible. Some studies suggest that guaifenesin causes birth defects . Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should check with their physicians before using any products that contain guaifenesin.

Causes and symptoms The most common cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome is the long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones in medica- tions. Medications such as prednisone are used in a num- ber of inflammatory conditions. Such conditions include rheumatoid arthritis , asthma, vasculitis , lupus, and a variety of other autoimmune disorders in which the body\u2019s immune cells accidentally attack some part of the body itself. In these disorders, the glucocorticoids are used to dampen the immune response, thereby decreas- ing damage to the body. Cushing\u2019s syndrome can also be caused by three dif- ferent categories of disease: \u2022 a pituitary tumor producing abnormally large quantities of ACTH \u2022 the abnormal production of ACTH by some source other than the pituitary \u2022 a tumor within the adrenal gland overproducing cortisol Although it is rare, about two-thirds of endoge- nous (occurring within the body rather than from a source outside the body, like a medication) Cushing\u2019s syndrome is a result of Cushing\u2019s disease. The term \u201cCushing\u2019s disease\u201d refers to Cushing\u2019s syndrome, which is caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by a pituitary tumor, usually an adenoma (noncancerous tumor). The pituitary tumor causes increased growth of the adrenal cortex (hyperplasia) and increased cortisol production. Cushing\u2019s disease affects women more often than men. Tumors in locations other than the pituitary can also produce ACTH. This is called ectopic ACTH syndrome (\u201cectopic\u201d refers to something existing out of its normal place). Tumors in the lung account for more than half of all cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome. Other types of tumors that may produce ACTH include tumors of the thymus, the pancreas, the thyroid, and the adrenal gland. Nearly all adrenal gland tumors are benign (noncancer- ous), although in rare instances a tumor may actually be cancerous. Symptoms of cortisol excess (resulting from med- ication or from the body\u2019s excess production of the hor- mone) include: \u2022 weight gain \u2022 an abnormal accumulation of fatty pads in the face (cre- ating the distinctive \u201cmoon face\u201d of Cushing\u2019s syn- drome); in the trunk (termed \u201ctruncal obesity\u201d); and over the upper back and the back of the neck (giving the individual what has been called a \u201cbuffalo hump\u201d) \u2022 purple and pink stretch marks across the abdomen and flanks \u2022 high blood pressure \u2022 weak, thinning bones (osteoporosis) \u2022 weak muscles \u2022 low energy \u2022 thin, fragile skin, with a tendency toward both bruising and slow healing \u2022 abnormalities in the processing of sugars (glucose), with occasional development of actual diabetes \u2022 kidney stones \u2022 increased risk of infections \u2022 emotional disturbances, including mood swings, depres- sion, irritability, confusion, or even a complete break with reality (psychosis) GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 971 Cushing\u2019s syndrome Woman with Cushing\u2019s syndrome.(Photo Researchers, Inc.

It involves measuring the amount of cortisol present in the urine over a 24-hour period. When excess cortisol is present in the blood- stream, it is processed by the kidneys and removed as waste in the urine. This 24-hour free cortisol test requires that an individual collect exactly 24-hours\u2019 worth of urine in a single container. The urine is then analyzed in a laboratory to determine the quantity of cortisol present. This technique can also be paired with the administration of dexamethasone, which in a normal individual would cause urine cortisol to be very low. Once a diagnosis has been made using the 24-hour free cortisol test, other tests are used to find the exact location of the abnormality causing excess cortisol production. Dexamethasone suppression test This test is useful in distinguishing individuals with excess ACTH production due to a pituitary adenoma from those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors. Patients are given dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocor- ticoid) orally every six hours for four days. Low doses of dexamethasone are given during the first two days; for the last two days, higher doses are administered. Before dexamethasone is administered, as well as on each day of the test, 24-hour urine collections are obtained. Because cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the pituitary to decrease ACTH, the normal response after taking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine corti- sol levels. Thus, the cortisol response to dexamethasone differs depending on whether the cause of Cushing\u2019s syn- drome is a pituitary adenoma or an ectopic ACTH-pro- ducing tumor. However, the dexamethasone suppression test may produce false-positive results in patients with conditions such as depression, alcohol abuse, high estrogen levels, acute illness, and stress. On the other hand, drugs such as phenytoin and phenobarbital may produce false-negative results. Thus, patients are usually advised to stop taking these drugs at least one week prior to the test.

          "content": "hormone androgen, which is present at birth and affects sexual development. Description CAH is a form of adrenal insufficiency in which the enzyme that produces two important adrenal steroid hor- mones, cortisol and aldosterone, is deficient. Because cortisol production is impeded, the adrenal gland instead overproduces androgens (male steroid hormones). Females with CAH are born with an enlarged clitoris and normal internal reproductive tract structures. Males have normal genitals at birth. CAH causes abnormal growth for both sexes; patients will be tall as children and short as adults. Females develop male characteristics, and males experience premature sexual development. In its most severe form, called salt-wasting CAH, a life-threatening adrenal crisis can occur if the disorder is untreated. Adrenal crisis can cause dehydration , shock, and death within 14 days of birth. There is also a mild form of CAH that occurs later in childhood or young adult life in which patients have partial enzyme deficiency. CAH, a genetic disorder, is the most common adren- al gland disorder in infants and children, occurring in one in 10,000 total births worldwide. It affects both females and males. It is also called adrenogenital syndrome. Causes and symptoms CAH is an inherited disorder. It is a recessive dis- ease, which means that a child must inherit one copy of the defective gene from each parent who is a carrier; when two carriers have children, each pregnancy carries a 25% risk of producing an affected child. In females, CAH produces an enlarged clitoris at birth and masculinization of features as the child grows, such as deepening of the voice, facial hair, and failure to menstruate or abnormal periods at puberty . Females with severe CAH may be mistaken for males at birth. In males, the genitals are normal at birth, but the child becomes muscular, the penis enlarges, pubic hair appears, and the voice deepens long before normal puberty, sometimes as early as two to three years of age. In the severe salt-wasting form of CAH, newborns may develop symptoms shortly after birth, including vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte (a compound such as sodium or calcium that separates to form ions when dis- solved in water) changes, and cardiac arrhythmia. In the mild form of CAH, which occurs in late child- hood or early adulthood, symptoms include premature development of pubic hair, irregular menstrual periods, unwanted body hair, or severe acne. However, some- times there are no symptoms. Diagnosis CAH is diagnosed by a careful examination of the genitals and blood and urine tests that measure the hor- mones produced by the adrenal gland. A number of states in the United States perform a hormonal test (a heel prick blood test) for CAH and other inherited dis- eases within a few days of birth. In questionable cases, genetic testing can provide a definitive diagnosis. For some forms of CAH, prenatal diagnosis is possible through chronic villus sampling in the first trimester and by measuring certain hormones in the amniotic fluid during the second trimester. Treatment The goal of treatment for CAH is to return the androgen levels to normal. This is usually accomplished through drug therapy, although surgery is an alternative. Lifelong treatment is required. Drug therapy consists of a cortisol-like steroid med- ication called a glucocorticoid. Oral hydrocortisone is prescribed for children, and prednisone or dexametha- sone is prescribed for older patients. For patients with salt-wasting CAH, fludrocortisone, which acts like aldosterone (the missing hormone), is also prescribed. Infants and small children may also receive salt tablets, while older patients are told to eat salty foods. Medical therapy achieves hormonal balance most of the time, but CAH patients can have periods of fluctuating hormonal control that lead to increases in the dose of steroids pre- scribed. Side effects of steroids include stunted growth. Steroid therapy should not be suddenly stopped, since adrenal insufficiency results. Patients with CAH should see a pediatric endocrinol- ogist frequently.

          "content": "the adrenal glands coordinate the production of cortisol. After corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is made in the hypothalamus, CRH stimulates the pituitary to pro- duce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The produc- tion of ACTH in turn stimulates a part of the adrenal glands known as the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol. Rising levels of cortisol act as a negative feedback to cur- tail further production of CRH and ACTH, thus complet- ing an elaborate feedback mechanism. There are two methods for evaluating cortisol: blood and urine. The most reliable index of cortisol secretion is the 24-hour urine sample collection, but when blood lev- els are required or requested by the physician, plasma cortisol should be measured in the morning and again in the afternoon. Cortisol levels normally rise and fall dur- ing the day in what is called a diurnal variation, so that cortisol is at its highest level between 6\u20138 A.M. and grad- ually falls, reaching its lowest point around midnight. One reason for ordering blood cortisol levels versus a 24- hour urine collection is that sometimes the earliest sign of adrenal malfunction is the loss of this diurnal varia- tion, even though the cortisol levels are not yet elevated. For example, individuals with Cushing\u2019s syndrome often have upper normal plasma cortisol levels in the morning and exhibit no decline as the day progresses. KEY TERMS Addison\u2019s disease\u2014A rare disorder in which symp- toms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocortisone (cortisol) and aldosterone, two corticosteroid hor- mones normally produced by a part of the adrenal glands called the adrenal cortex. Symptoms include weakness, tiredness, vague abdominal pain, weight loss, skin pigmentation and low blood pressure. Adrenal glands\u2014A pair of endocrine glands (glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood- stream) that are located on top of the kidneys. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) \u2014Also called corticotropin, this hormone is produced by the pituitary gland to stimulate the adrenal cortex to release various corticosteroid hormones. Cushing\u2019s syndrome\u2014A hormonal disorder caused by an abnormally high level of corticosteroid hor- mones that are produced by the adrenal glands. Cor- ticosteroid hormones control the body\u2019s use of nutri- ents and the excretion of salts and water in the urine. Symptoms include high blood sugar levels, a moon face, weight gain, and increased blood pressure Preparation When testing for cortisol levels through the blood, a blood specimen is usually collected at 8 A.M. and again at 4 P.M. It should be noted that normal values may be trans- posed in individuals who have worked during the night and slept during the day for long periods of time. When testing for cortisol level through the urine, a 24-hour urine sample is collected, refrigerated, and sent to the reference laboratory for examination. Risks Risks for the blood test are minimal, but may include slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (blood accumulating under the puncture site). Normal results Reference ranges for cortisol vary from laboratory to laboratory but are usually within the following ranges for blood: \u2022 adults (8 A.M.): 6\u201328 mg/dL; adults (4 P.M.): 2\u201312 mg/dL \u2022 child one to six years (8 A.M.): 3\u201321 mg/dL; child one to six years (4 P.M.): 3\u201310 mg/dL \u2022 newborn: 1/24 mg/dL Reference ranges for cortisol vary from laboratory to laboratory, but are usually within the following ranges for 24-hour urine collection: \u2022 adult: 10\u2013100 mg/24 hours \u2022 adolescent: 5\u201355 mg/24 hours \u2022 child: 2\u201327 mg/24 hours Abnormal results Increased levels of cortisol are found in Cushing\u2019s syndrome, excess thyroid ( hyperthyroidism ), obesity , ACTH-producing tumors, and high levels of stress. Decreased levels of cortisol are found in Addison\u2019s disease, conditions of low thyroid, and hypopituitarism, in which pituitary activity is diminished. Resources BOOKS Cahill, Mathew.

          "content": "those with either ectopic ACTH syndrome or cortisol- secreting adrenal tumors. In this test, patients are given an injection of CRH, the corticotropin-releasing hor- mone that causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. In patients with pituitary adenomas, blood levels of ACTH and cortisol usually rise. However, in patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome, this rise is rarely seen. In patients with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors, this rise almost never occurs. Petrosal sinus sampling Although this test is not always necessary, it may be used to distinguish between a pituitary adenoma and an ectopic source of ACTH. Petrosal sinus sampling involves drawing blood directly from veins that drain the pituitary. This test, which is usually performed with local anesthe- sia and mild sedation, requires inserting tiny, flexible tubes (catheters) through a vein in the upper thigh or groin area. The catheters are then threaded up slowly until they reach veins in an area of the skull known as the pet- rosal sinuses. X rays are typically used to confirm the cor- rect position of the catheters. Often CRH is also given during the test to increase the accuracy of results. When blood tested from the petrosal sinuses reveals a higher ACTH level than blood drawn from a vein in the forearm, the likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma. When the two samples show similar levels of ACTH, the diagnosis indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome. Radiologic imaging tests Imaging tests such as computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are only used to look at the pituitary and adrenal glands after a firm diagnosis has already been made. The presence of a pituitary or adrenal tumor does not necessarily guarantee that it is the source of increased ACTH production. Many healthy people with no symptoms or disease whatsoever have noncancerous tumors in the pituitary and adrenal glands. Thus, CT and MRI is often used to image the pituitary and adrenal glands in preparation for surgery. Treatment The choice of a specific treatment depends on the type of problem causing the cortisol excess. Pituitary and adrenal adenomas are usually removed surgically. Malig- nant adrenal tumors always require surgical removal. Treatment of ectopic ACTH syndrome also involves removing all of the cancerous cells that are producing ACTH. This may be done through surgery, chemothera- py (using combinations of cancer-killing drugs), or radi- ation therapy (using x rays to kill cancer cells), depend- ing on the type of cancer and how far it has spread. Radi- ation therapy may also be used on the pituitary (with or without surgery) for patients who cannot undergo surgery, or for patients whose surgery did not successful- ly decrease pituitary release of ACTH. There are a number of drugs that are effective in decreasing adrenal production of cortisol. These medica- tions include mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone, trilostane, aminoglutethimide, and mifepristone . These drugs are sometimes given prior to surgery in an effort to reverse the problems brought on by cortisol excess. How- ever, the drugs may also need to be administered after surgery (sometimes along with radiation treatments) in patients who continue to have excess pituitary production of ACTH. Because pituitary surgery can cause ACTH levels to drop too low, some patients require short-term treatment with a cortisol-like medication after surgery. Patients who need adrenal surgery may also require glucocorti- coid replacement. If the entire adrenal gland has been removed, the patient must take oral glucocorticoids for the rest of his or her life. Prognosis Prognosis depends on the source of the problem. When pituitary adenomas are identified as the source of increased ACTH leading to cortisol excess, about 80% of patients are cured by surgery. When cortisol excess is due to some other form of cancer, the prognosis depends on the type of cancer and the extent of its spread. Resources BOOKS Brickner, Colleen.

Rosalyn Carson-DeWitt Cutaneous larva migrans Definition Cutaneous larvae migrans is a parasitic skin disease caused by a hookworm larvae that usually infests dogs, cats, and other animals. Humans can pick up the infec- tion by walking barefoot on soil or beaches contaminated with animal feces. Description Cutaneous larvae migrans (also called \u201ccreeping eruption\u201d or \u201cground itch\u201d) is found in southeastern and Gulf states, and in tropical developing countries. The hookworms that cause the condition are small, round blood-sucking worms that infest about 700 million people around the world. Cutaneous larvae migrans occurs most often among children, those who crawl beneath raised buildings, and sunbathers who lie down on wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae. Causes and symptoms After an animal passes feces that are infested with hookworm eggs, the eggs hatch into infective larvae that are able to penetrate human skin (even through solid material, such as a beach towel). The larvae are common- ly found in shaded, moist, or sandy areas (such as beach- es, a child\u2019s sandbox, or areas underneath a house), where they are easily picked up by bare feet or buttocks. In minor infestations, there may be no symptoms at all. In more severe cases, a red elevation of the skin (papule) appears within a few hours after the larvae have penetrated the skin. This usually arises first in areas that are in contact with the soil, such as the feet, hands, and buttocks. Between a few days and a few months after infec- tion, the larvae begin to migrate beneath the skin, leaving extremely itchy red lines that may be accompanied by blisters. These red lines usually appear at the top of the sole of the foot or on the buttocks. Tyically, the larvae travel through the bloodstream, to the lungs, and then migrate into the mouth where they are swallowed and attach to the small intestine lining. There they mature into adult worms. In cases where the larvae migrate through the lungs, they can produce anemia, cough, and pneumonia, in addition to the itchy rash. Diagnosis The condition can be diagnosed by microscopic inspection of feces which can reveal hookworm eggs. In addition visual inspection of the skin would reveal tell- tale itchy red lines and blisters.

          "content": "ual can also become infected by inhaling and swallowing the eggs, for example, when the bedcovers are shaken. Many individuals with enterobiasis exhibit no symp- toms. When present, however, symptoms of the infection begin approximately two weeks after ingesting the pin- worm eggs. The main symptom is itching around the anus. Because the itching intensifies at night, when the female worms comes to the anus to lay eggs, it often leads to disrupted sleep and irritability. Poor sleeping at night in small children can be related to pinworms. Occa- sionally, the itching causes some bleeding and bruising in the region, and secondary bacterial infections can occur. In females, the itching may spread to the vagina and sometimes causes an infection of the vaginal region (vaginitis). Enterobiasis usually lasts one to two months. Diagnosis First, a physician will rule out other potential causes of the itching, such as hemorrhoids , lice, or fungal or bacterial infection. Once these have been ruled out, an accurate diagnosis of enterobiasis will require that either the eggs or the adult worms are detected. Rarely, the adult worms are seen as thin, yellowish-white threads, about 0.4 in (1 cm) long, in the stools of the infected person. Usually, an hour or so after the individual goes to sleep, the adult female worms may be seen moving around lay- ing eggs if a flashlight is shone at the rectal area. An easier method is to observe the eggs under the microscope. In order to collect a specimen for laboratory diagnosis, the physician may provide a paddle with a sticky adhesive on one side, or an individual may be instructed to place a piece of shiny cellophane tape sticky side down against the anal opening. The best time to per- form this test is at night or as soon as the individual wakes up in the morning, before having a bowel move- ment or taking a bath or shower. The pinworm eggs will stick to the tape, which can then be placed on a specimen KEY TERMS Anus\u2014The opening through which feces are elim- inated.

When under a microscope in the laboratory, the eggs will be clearly visible. Treatment In order to treat the disease, either mebendazole (Vermox) or pyrantel pamoate (Pin-X) will be given in two oral doses spaced two weeks apart. These medica- tions eradicate the infection in approximately 90% of cases. Re-infection is common and several treatments may be required. Because the infection is easily spread through contact with contaminated clothing or surfaces, it is recommended that all family members receive the therapeutic dose. Sometimes a series of six treatments are given, each spaced two weeks apart. If family mem- bers continue to be infected, a source outside the house may be responsible. To relieve the rectal itching, a shallow warm bath with either half a cup of table salt, or Epsom salts is rec- ommended. Also, application of an ointment containing zinc oxide or regular petroleum jelly can be used to relieve rectal itching. Prognosis Pinworms cause little damage and can be easily erad- icated with proper treatment. Full recovery is expected. Prevention The disease can be prevented by treating all the infected cases and thus eliminating the source of infec- tion. Some ways to keep from catching or spreading the disease include the following recommendations: \u2022 wash hands thoroughly before handling food and eating \u2022 keep finger nails short and clean \u2022 avoiding scratching the anal area \u2022 take early morning showers to wash away eggs deposit- ed overnight \u2022 once the infection has been identified, and treatment is started, change the bed linen, night clothes, and under- wear daily \u2022 machine wash linens in hot water and dry with heat to kill any eggs \u2022 open the blinds or curtains since eggs are sensitive to sunlight Resources BOOKS Harrison\u2019s Principles of Internal Medicine.

However, some species such as C. fetus produce disease outside the intes- tine, particularly in those with altered immune systems, such as people with AIDS, cancer, and liver disease. Campylobacter are often found in the intestine of animals raised for food produce and pets. Infected ani- mals often have no symptoms. Chickens are the most common source of human infection. It is estimated that 1% of the general population is infected each year. Causes and symptoms Improper or incomplete food preparation is the most common way the disease is spread, with poultry account- ing for over half the cases. Untreated water and raw milk are also potential sources. The incubation period after exposure is from one to 10 days. A day or two of mild fever, muscle aches, and headache occur before intestinal symptoms begin. Diar- rhea with or without blood and severe abdominal cramps are the major intestinal symptoms. The severity of symp- toms is variable, ranging from only mild fever to dehy- dration and rarely death (mainly in the very young or old). The disease usually lasts about one week, but per- KEY TERMS Antibiotic\u2014A medication that is designed to kill or weaken bacteria. Anti-motility medications \u2014Medications such as loperamide (Imodium), dephenoxylate (Lomotil), or medications containing codeine or narcotics which decrease the ability of the intestine to contract. This can worsen the condition of a patient with dysen- tery or colitis. Fluoroquinolones \u2014A relatively new group of anti- biotics that have had good success in treating infec- tions with many Gram-negative bacteria. One drawback is that they should not be used in child- ren under 17 years of age, because of possible effect on bone growth. Food-borne illness\u2014A disease that is transmitted by eating or handling contaminated food. Gram-negative \u2014Refers to the property of many bacteria that causes them to not take up color with Gram\u2019s stain, a method which is used to identify bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria which take up the stain turn purple, while Gram-negative bacteria which do not take up the stain turn red. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome \u2014Progressive and usually reversible paralysis or weakness of multiple muscles usually starting in the lower extremities and often ascending to the muscles involved in respiration. The syndrome is due to inflammation and loss of the myelin covering of the nerve fibers, often asso- ciated with an acute infection. Meninges \u2014Outer covering of the spinal cord and brain. Infection is called meningitis, which can lead to damage to the brain or spinal cord and even death.

Especially at the extremes of age, this should be watched for and treated with either Oral Rehydration Solution or intravenous fluid replacement. Infection may also involve areas outside the intes- tine. This is unusual, except for infections with C. fetus. C. fetus infections tend to occur in those who have dis- eases of decreased immunity such as AIDS, cancer, etc. This subtype is particularly adapted to protect itself from the body\u2019s defenses.

Rebecca J. Frey Enterobiasis Definition Enterobiasis, or pinworm infection as it is common- ly called, is an intestinal infection caused by the parasitic roundworm called Enterobius vermicularis . The most common symptom of this irritating, but not particularly dangerous, disease is itching around the anal area. Description Enterobiasis is also called seatworm infection or oxyuriasis. In the United States, enterobiasis is the most common worm infection, and some estimate that approx- imately 10% of the United States population is infected. Worldwide, approximately 200 million people are infect- ed. Enterobiasis can affect people of any age, but is most common among children ages 5\u201314 and particularly affects those in the daycare setting. Causes and symptoms The disease is highly contagious and is caused by a parasitic worm called Enterobius vermicularis. The adult female worm is about the size of a staple (approximately 0.4 in [1 cm] long and 0.02 in [0.5 mm] wide) and has a pointed tip. The disease is transmitted by ingesting the eggs of the pinworm. These eggs travel to the small intes- tine where, after approximately one month, they hatch and mature into adult worms. During the night, the female adult worms travel to the area around the anus and deposit eggs in the folds of the anal area. A single female pinworm can lay 10,000 eggs and, after laying eggs, dies. The eggs are capable of causing infection after six hours at body temperature. Significant itching in the anal region is caused by the movement of the adult worm as the eggs are deposited. When an individual scratches the anal region, the tiny eggs get under the finger nails and in the underwear and night clothes. Anything the individual touches with the contami- nated fingers, for example, toys, bedding, blankets, bath- room door knobs, or sinks, becomes contaminated. The eggs are very hardy and can live on surfaces for two to three weeks. Anyone touching these contaminated sur- faces can ingest the eggs and become infected.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurally mediated hypotension , causes a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person has been standing, exercising or exposed to heat for a while.

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion.

Several samples might be taken, depending on the size of the abnormal area. A biopsy may cause temporary discomfort and cramping, which usually go away within a few minutes. If the abnormal area appears to extend inside the cervical canal, a scrap- ing of the canal may be done. The biopsy results are usu- ally available within a week. If the tissue sample indicates abnormal growth (dys- plasia) or precancer, and if the entire abnormal area can be seen, the doctor can destroy the tissue using one of several procedures, including ones that use high heat (diathermy), extreme cold (cryosurgery), or lasers. Another procedure, called a loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP), uses low-voltage high-frequency radio waves to excise tissue.

The entire length of the large intestine can be exam- ined in this manner. If suspicious growths are observed, tiny biopsy forceps or brushes can be inserted through the colon and tissue samples can be obtained. Small polyps can also be removed through the colonoscope. After the procedure, the colonoscope is slowly with- drawn and the instilled air is allowed to escape. The anal area is then cleansed with tissues.

If the urinary stream becomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad- der may cause severe discomfort, a condition called acute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad- der can easily become infected. A burning feeling during urination and fever are clues that infection may have developed. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it may increase pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus- es permanent kidney damage. Diagnosis When a man\u2019s symptoms point to BPH, the first thing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal examination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel whether\u2014and how much\u2014the prostate is enlarged. A smooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis- tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer . The next step is a blood test for a substance called prostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30\u201350% of men with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This does not mean cancer by any means, but other measures are needed to make sure that the prostate enlargement is in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate, which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, can show whether it is enlarged and may show that cancer is present. If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate raises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec- ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. This is usually done using a lance-like instrument that is inserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and, guided by the physcian\u2019s finger, obtains six to eight pieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination. If cancer is present, the prognosis and treatment are changed accordingly. A catheter placed through the urethra and into the bladder can show how much urine remains in the bladder after the patient urinates\u2014a measure of how severe the obstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc- tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter, which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain\u2014 though invasive\u2014way of confirming obstruction from an enlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrument called a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not often necessary. It is routine to check a urine sample for an increased number of white blood cells, which may mean there is infection of the bladder or kidneys. The same sample may be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus- ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best.

          "content": "Laboratory tests After taking the woman\u2019s history, the gynecologist or family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Pap smear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding, the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood tests to check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini- tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter- mine the level of other hormones that play a role in reproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenal function test are also commonly done. Imaging Imaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval- uating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina- tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to help locate uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyoma, a type of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy\u2014 where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly into the uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining\u2014is also used to assess the condition of the uterus. Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial polyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer. In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast media has been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to locate fibroids and tumors. Invasive procedures Endometrial biopsy (the removal and examination of endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce- dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter- ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to be sampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities. Dilation and curettage (D & C), once common is rarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done while the patient is under either general or regional anesthesia. Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as part of the diagnostic procedure, than younger women. Because DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other possible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time and involve many tests and procedures. Older women are likely to need more extensive tests than adolescents because the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greater in this age group, and therefore must be definitively eliminated before treating bleeding symptoms. Treatment Treatment of DUB depends on the cause of the bleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlying cause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated. KEY TERMS Dilation and curettage (D & C) \u2014A procedure performed under anesthesia during which the cervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus is scraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrument or a suction tube. The procedure can be either diagnostic, or to remove polyps. Endometrial biopsy \u2014The removal of tissue either by suction or scraping of samples of tissue from the uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedure has a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D & C, but can be done as an office procedure under local anesthesia. Endometrial cancer\u2014Cancer of the inner mucous membrane of the uterus. Fibroids, or fibroid tumors \u2014Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus. They occur in 30\u201340% of women over age 40, and do not need to be removed unless they are causing symptoms that interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities. Hypothyroidism\u2014A disorder in which the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone causing a decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat- ed effects on the reproductive system. Lupus erythematosus \u2014A chronic inflammatory disease in which inappropriate immune system reactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels and connective tissue. Progesterone \u2014A hormone naturally secreted by the ovary, or manufactured synthetically, that prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil- ized egg. Prostaglandins \u2014A group of chemicals that medi- ate, or determine the actions of other chemicals in the cell or body. Otherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp- toms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities or cause anemia. Generally the first approach to controlling DUB is to use oral contraceptives that provide a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep- tives are often very effective in adolescents and young women in their twenties.

          "content": "cancer has to be weighed against the side effects of the treatment. If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure is not possible, then the treatment should be aimed at relieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for as long as possible. Cancer treatment can take many different forms, and it is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci- sion on which type of treatment is the most appropriate depends on the type and location of cancer, the extent to which it has already spread, the patient\u2019s age, sex, gener- al health status and personal treatment preferences. The major types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo- therapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone- marrow transplantation. Surgery Surgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the most frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec- tive when a cancer is small and confined to one area of the body. Surgery can be used for many purposes. \u2022 Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves removal of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical- ly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area. Along with the cancer, some part of the normal sur- rounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreads via the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes may be examined and sometimes they are removed as well. \u2022 Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery involves removal of an abnormal looking area that is likely to become malignant over time. For example, 40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer- ative colitis, ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than live with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo- ple may choose to have their colons removed and reduce the risk significantly. \u2022 Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag- nosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can be performed by inserting a needle through the skin. How- ever, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissue sample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation. \u2022 Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible, and then treats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo- therapy or both. \u2022 Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not the cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large or has spread so much that removing the entire tumor is not an option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may be so large that it may press on and block a portion of the intestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain and vomiting. \u201cDebulking surgery\u201d may remove a part of the blockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that are dependent on hormones, removal of the organs that secrete the hormones is an option. For example, in prostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi- cles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a man may undergo an \u201corchiectomy\u201d (removal of testi- cles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in a type of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) will stop the synthesis of hormones from the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer. Radiation Radiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone in cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More often, it is used in conjunction with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter- nal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at the tumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (also known as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in the form of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous site by means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con- tainer.

For the heart to pump blood efficiently, the four chambers must contract and relax, and the four valves must open and close, in a well coordinated fashion. By damaging the valves or the walls of the heart chambers, endocarditis can interfere with the ability of the heart to do its job. Endocarditis rarely occurs in people with healthy, normal hearts. Rather, it most commonly occurs when there is damage to the endocardium. The endocardium may be affected by a congenital heart defect, such as mitral valve prolapse , in which blood leaks through a poorly functioning mitral valve back into the heart. It may also be damaged by a prior scarring of the heart muscle, such as rheumatic fever , or replacement of a heart valve. Any of these conditions can damage the endocardium and make it more susceptible to infection. Bacteria can get into the blood stream (a condition known as bacteremia) in a number of different ways: It may spread from a localized infection such as a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or skin infection or get into the blood stream as a result of certain medical condi- tions, such as severe periodontal disease, colon cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease. It can enter the blood stream during minor procedures, such as periodontal surgery, tooth extractions, teeth cleaning, tonsil removal, prostate removal, or endoscopic examination. It can also be introduced through in-dwelling catheters, which are used for intravenous medications, intravenous feeding, or dialysis. In people who use intravenous drugs, the bacte- ria can enter the blood stream through unsterilized, cont- aminated needles and syringes. (People who are prone to endocarditis generally need to take prescribed antibi- otics before certain surgical or dental procedures to help prevent this infection.) If not discovered and treated, infective endocarditis can permanently damage the heart muscle, especially the valves. For the heart to work properly, all four valves must be functioning well, opening at the right time to let blood flow in the right direction and closing at the right time to keep the blood from flowing in the wrong direc- tion. If the valve is damaged, this may allow blood to flow backward\u2014a condition known as regurgitation. As a result of a poorly functioning valve, the heart muscle has to work harder to pump blood and may become weak- ened, leading to heart failure. Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood well enough to supply blood adequately to the body. Another danger associated with endocarditis is that the vegetation formed by bacteria colonizing on heart valves may break off, forming emboli. These emboli may travel through the circulation and become lodged in blood vessels. By blocking the flow of blood, emboli can starve various tissues of nutrients and oxygen, dam- aging them. For instance, an embolus lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs may cause pneumonia-like symptoms. An embolus may also affect the brain, dam- aging nerve tissue, or the kidneys, causing kidney dis- ease. Emboli may also weaken the tiny blood vessels called capillaries, causing hemorrhages (leaking blood vessels) throughout the body. Causes and symptoms Most cases of infective endocarditis occur in people between the ages of 15 and 60, with a median age at onset of about 50 years. Men are affected about twice as often as women are. Other factors that put people at increased risk for endocarditis are congenital heart prob- lems, heart surgery, previous episodes of endocarditis, and intravenous drug use. While there is no single specific symptom of endo- carditis, a number of symptoms may be present. The most common symptom is a mild fever, which rarely goes above 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C). Other symptoms include chills, weakness, cough, trouble breathing, headaches, aching joints, and loss of appetite. Emboli may also cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their location. Emboli throughout the body may cause Osler\u2019s nodes, small, reddish, painful bumps most commonly found on the inside of fingers and toes.

The plural of embolism is emboli. Description Emboli have moved from the place where they were formed through the bloodstream to another part of the body, where they obstruct an artery and block the flow of blood. The emboli are usually formed from blood clots but are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis- sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or single and massive. They can be life-threatening and require immediate emergency medical care. There are three gen- eral categories of emboli: arterial, gas, and pulmonary. Pulmonary emboli are the most common. Arterial embolism In arterial emboli, blood flow is blocked at the junc- tion of major arteries, most often at the groin, knee, or thigh. Arterial emboli are generally a complication of heart disease. An arterial embolism in the brain (cere- bral embolism) causes stroke, which can be fatal. An estimated 5\u201314% of all strokes are caused by cerebral emboli. Arterial emboli to the extremities can lead to tis- sue death and amputation of the affected limb if not treated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneys can also suffer damage from emboli. Gas embolism Gas emboli result from the compression of respira- tory gases into the blood and other tissues due to rapid changes in environmental pressure, for example, while flying or scuba diving. As external pressure decreases, gases (like nitrogen) that are dissolved in the blood and other tissues become small bubbles that can block blood flow and cause organ damage. Pulmonary embolism In a pulmonary embolism, a common illness, blood flow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli block the main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there are no initial symptoms, a pulmonary embolism can quickly become fatal. According to the American Heart Associa- tion, an estimated 600,000 Americans develop pulmonary emboli annually and 60,000 die from it. A pulmonary embolism is difficult to diagnose. Less than 10% of patients who die from a pulmonary embolism were diagnosed with the condition. More than 90% of cases of pulmonary emboli are complications of deep vein thrombosis , blood clots in the deep vein of the leg or pelvis. Causes and symptoms Arterial emboli are usually a complication of heart disease where blood clots form in the heart\u2019s chambers. Gas emboli are caused by rapid changes in environmen- tal pressure that could happen when flying or scuba div- ing. A pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel through the blood stream to the lungs and block a pulmonary artery. More than 90% of the cases of pul- monary embolism are a complication of deep vein thrombosis, which typically occurs in patients who have had orthopedic surgery and patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses like congestive heart failure. Risk factors for arterial and pulmonary emboli include: prolonged bed rest, surgery, childbirth , heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer,obesity,a broken hip or leg, oral contraceptives , sickle cell ane- mia, chest trauma, certain congenital heart defects, and old age. Risk factors for gas emboli include: scuba div- ing, amateur plane flight, exercise, injury, obesity, dehy- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1169 Embolism",

If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of breath . Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symp- toms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss or double vision. Emboli may also damage the kidneys, causing blood to appear in the urine. Sometimes the cap- illaries on the surface of the spleen rupture, causing the spleen to become enlarged and tender to the touch. Any- one experiencing any of these symptoms should seek medical help immediately. Diagnosis Doctors begin the diagnosis by taking a history, ask- ing the patient about the symptoms mentioned above. During a physical examination , the doctor may also uncover signs such as fever, an enlarged spleen, signs of kidney disease, or hemorrhaging. Listening to the patient\u2019s chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may also hear a heart murmur. A heart murmur may indicate abnormal flow of blood through one of the heart cham- bers or valves. Doctors take a sample of the patient\u2019s blood to test it for bacteria and other microorganisms that may be caus- ing the infection. They usually also use a test called echocardiography , which uses ultrasound waves to make images of the heart, to check for abnormalities in the structure of the heart wall or valves. One of the tell- tale signs they look for in echocardiography is vegeta- tion, the abnormal growth of tissue around a valve com- posed of blood platelets, bacteria, and a clotting protein called fibrin. Another tell-tale sign is regurgitation, or the backward flow of blood, through one of the heart valves. A normal echocardiogram does not exclude the possibili- ty of endocarditis, but an abnormal echocardiogram can confirm its presence. If an echocardiogram cannot be done or its results are inconclusive, a modified technique called transesophageal echocardiography is some- times performed. Transesophageal echocardiography involves passing an ultrasound device into the esophagus to get a clearer image of the heart. Treatment When doctors suspect infective endocarditis, they will admit the patient to a hospital and begin treating the infection before they even have the results of the blood culture. Their choice of antibiotics depends on what the most likely infecting microorganism is. Once the results of the blood culture become available, the doctor can adjust the medications, using specific antibiotics known to be effective against the specific microorganism involved. Unfortunately, in recent years, the treatment of endocarditis has become more complicated as a result of antibiotic resistance. Over the past few years, especially as antibiotics have been overprescribed, more and more strains of bacteria have become increasingly resistant to a wider range of antibiotics. For this reason, doctors may need to try a few different types of antibiotics\u2014or even a combination of antibiotics\u2014to successfully treat the infection. Antibiotics are usually given for about one month, but may need to be given for an even longer peri- od of time if the infection is resistant to treatment. Once the fever and the worst of the symptoms have gone away, the patient may be able to continue antibiotic therapy at home. During this time, the patient should make regular visits to the health care team for further testing and physical examination to make sure that the antibiotic therapy is working, that it is not causing adverse side effects, and that there are no complications such as emboli or heart failure. The patient should alert the health-care team to any symptoms that could indicate serious complications: For instance, trouble breathing or swelling in the legs could indicate congestive heart fail- ure. Headache, joint pain, blood in the urine, or stroke symptoms could indicate an embolus, and fever and chills could indicate that the treatment is not working and the infection is worsening. Finally, diarrhea, rash, itch- ing, or joint pain may suggest a bad reaction to the antibiotics. Anyone experiencing any of these symptoms should alert the health care team immediately. In some cases, surgery may be needed. These include cases of congestive heart failure, recurring GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1184 Endocarditis This echocardiogram shows an aortic regurgitation due to endocarditis, an infection of the lining membrane of the car- diac chambers.

The most common surgical treatment involves cutting away (debriding) damaged tis- sue and replacing the damaged valve. Prognosis If left untreated, infective endocarditis continues to progress and is always fatal. However, if it is diagnosed and properly treated within the first six weeks of infec- tion, the infection can be completely cured in about 90% of the cases. The prognosis depends on a number of fac- tors, such as the patient\u2019s age and overall physical condi- tion, the severity of the diseases involved, the exact site of the infection, how vulnerable the microorganisms are to antibiotics, and what kind of complications the endo- carditis may be causing.

Common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: \u2022 labored breathing, sometimes accompanied by chest pain \u2022 a rapid pulse \u2022a cough that may produce sputum \u2022 a low-grade fever \u2022 fluid build-up in the lungs Less common symptoms include: \u2022 coughing up blood \u2022 pain caused by movement or breathing \u2022 leg swelling \u2022 bluish skin \u2022 fainting \u2022 swollen neck veins Symptoms of an arterial embolism include: \u2022 severe pain in the area of the embolism \u2022 pale, bluish cool skin \u2022 numbness \u2022 tingling \u2022 muscular weakness or paralysis Diagnosis An embolism can be diagnosed through the patient\u2019s history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For arterial emboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography are ordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray, lung scan, pulmonary angiography , electrocardiography , arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or venous ultrasound could be ordered. Diagnosing an arterial embolism Ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer then presses it against the patient\u2019s body. The ultrasound\u2019s sound waves arteries are converted into an image that can be displayed on a moni- tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30\u201360 minutes. An arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi- um is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. It can be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or diagnostic center of a hospital. Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism A chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect other respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan shows poor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. The patient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceutical and pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with a gamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical is injected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned. A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonary embolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital or an outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes. Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used often because it is expensive, invasive, and not readily available in most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographic test which involves injection of a radio contrast agent to show the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera records the blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul- monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital\u2019s radiology medicine department and takes 30\u201360 minutes. An electrocardiograph shows the heart\u2019s electrical activity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolism from a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient\u2019s chest, arms, and legs. Impulses of the heart\u2019s activity are traced on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes. Arterial blood gas measurements are sometimes helpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonary embolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of a vein, usually in the wrist. Venography is used to look for the most likely source of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis. It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it is painful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high dose of radiation, and can cause complications.

          "content": "As many as three to four million people are estimat- ed to be chronic cocaine users. The 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported an estimated 600,000 current crack users, showing no significant change since the late 1980s. How cocaine affects the brain Extensive research has been conducted to determine how cocaine works on the brain and why it is so addictive. Cocaine has been found to affect an area of the brain known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which con- nects with the nucleus accumbens, a major pleasure cen- ter. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs, cocaine\u2019s effects are related to the action of the neuro- transmitter dopamine, which carries information between neurons. Cocaine interferes with the normal functioning of neurons by blocking the re-uptake of dopamine, which builds up in the synapses and is believed to cause the pleasurable feelings reported by cocaine users. Short-term effects of use The short-term effects of cocaine can include: \u2022 rapid heartbeat \u2022 constricted blood vessels \u2022 dilated pupils \u2022 increased temperature \u2022 increased energy \u2022 reduced appetite \u2022 increased sense of alertness \u2022 euphoria \u2022 death due to overdose Long-term effects of use The long-term effects of cocaine and crack use include: \u2022 dependence, addiction \u2022 irritability \u2022 mood swings \u2022 restlessness \u2022 weight loss \u2022 auditory hallucinations \u2022 paranoia Cocaine use and pregnancy The rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of crack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about its effects on the developing fetus and, since then, several research reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine use could be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn, and child development problems. According to the The Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation, many of these early reports had methodological flaws, and most researchers nowadays propose more cautious conclu- sions concerning prenatal cocaine effects. Much evi- dence would seem to point to the lack of quality prenatal care and the use of alcohol and tobacco as primary fac- tors in poor fetal development among pregnant cocaine users. Research sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Cen- ter findings in reporting that the lack of quality prenatal care is associated with undesirable effects often attrib- uted to cocaine exposure such as prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal or infant death. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) however, reports that mothers who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five times as likely to have a baby with a malformation of the urinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug. Thus, cocaine use during pregnancy is assuredly most inadvis- able, especially since it is also often associated with the use of alcohol known to cause long-term developmental problems. Supporting the cocaine-exposed expecting mother so as to discourage cocaine use remains an important task for all health caregivers. Diagnosis Diagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult. Many of the signs of short-term cocaine use are not obvious. Since cocaine users often also use other drugs, it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of one drug from another. Cocaine use has been documented in significant numbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over all age groups, more men than women use the drug. The highest rate of cocaine use is found among adults 18 to 25 years old.

Peter Gregutt Coccidioidomycosis Definition Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhal- ing the microscopic spores of the fungus Coccidioides immitis. Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures that fungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists in three forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms. The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years after initial infection and, in the lungs, can produce inflamed, injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses). Dissemi- nated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of coccid- ioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body affecting many organ systems and is often fatal. Description Coccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The fungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desert soil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Cen- tral and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is some- times called San Joaquin fever, valley fever, or desert fever because of its prevalence in the farming valleys of California. Although commonly acquired, overt coccid- ioidomycosis is a rare disease. Chronic infections occur in only one out of every 100,000 people. Although anyone can get coccidioidomycosis, farm laborers, construction workers, and archaeologists who work where it is dusty are at greater risk to become infected. People of any age can get coccidioidomycosis, but the disease most commonly occurs in the 25\u201355 age group. In its acute form, coccidioidomycosis infects men and women equally. Chronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomy- cosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant women. Although it is not clear why, people of color are 10-20 times more likely to develop the disseminated form of the disease than caucasians. People who have a weak- ened immune system (immunocompromised), either from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the result of medications that suppressed the immune system ( cor- ticosteroids, chemotherapy), are more likely to develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Causes and symptoms When the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they can become lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause localized inflammation. This is known as acute or primary coccid- ioidomycosis. The disease is not spread from one person to another. Approximately 60% of people who are infect- ed exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other 40%, symptoms appear 10\u201330 days after exposure. These symptoms include a fever which can reach 104\u00b0F (39.5\u00b0C), dry cough, chest pains, joint and muscle aches, headache , and weight loss. About two weeks after the start of the fever, some people develop a painful red rash or lumps on the lower legs. Symptoms usually disappear without treatment in about one month. People who have been infected gain partial immunity to reinfection. The chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally occurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years dur- ing which the patient experiences no symptoms of the disease.

Lohr, PhD Cocaine Definition Cocaine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant extracted from the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylon coca. Description In its most common form, cocaine is a whitish crys- talline powder that produces feelings of euphoria when ingested. Now classified as a Schedule II drug, cocaine has legitimate medical uses as well as a long history of recre- ational abuse. Administered by a licensed physician, the drug can be used as a local anesthetic for certain eye and ear problems and in some kinds of surgery. Forms of the drug In powder form, cocaine is known by such street names as \u201ccoke,\u201d \u201cblow,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d \u201cflake,\u201d \u201csnow\u201d and KEY TERMS Dyspnea\u2014Difficulty in breathing.

Crack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces an immediate and more intense high. It comes in off- white chunks or chips called \u201crocks.\u201d Little crumbs of crack are sometimes called \u201ckibbles & bits.\u201d In addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine and crack are often mixed with other substances. Cocaine may be mixed with methcathinone (a more recent drug of abuse, known as \u201ccat,\u201d that is similar to methampheta- mine) to create a \u201cwildcat.\u201d A hollowed-out cigar filled with a mixture of crack and marijuana is known as a \u201cwoolah.\u201d And either cocaine or crack used in conjunc- tion with heroin is called a \u201cspeedball.\u201d Cocaine used together with alcohol represents the most common fatal two-drug combination. History Cocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive drugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used by the Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region of South America for thousands of years, both as a stimu- lant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia ( altitude sickness). Despite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not until the latter part of the nineteenth century that the active ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride, was first extracted from those leaves. The new drug soon became a common ingredient in patent medicines and other popular products (including the original formula for Coca-Cola). This widespread use quickly raised con- cerns about the drug\u2019s negative effects. In the early 1900s, several legislative steps were taken to address those concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the use of cocaine and other substances in non-prescription prod- ucts. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use declined substantially. The drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed interest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the 1980s, use of the drug had once again become a national prob- lem. Cocaine use declined significantly during the early 1990s, but it remains a significant problem and is on the increase in certain geographic areas and among certain age groups. Causes and symptoms As with other forms of addiction , cocaine abuse is the result of a complex combination of internal and external factors. Genetic predisposition, family history, and immediate environment can all affect a person\u2019s probability of becoming addicted. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 831 Cocaine",

Prolonged snorting, for exam- ple, can irritate the nasal septum, producing nosebleeds, chronic runny nose, and other problems. Intravenous users face an increased risk of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Testing Drug testing can be useful in diagnosing and treating cocaine abuse. Urine testing can detect cocaine; besides providing an objective alternative to reliance on what a patient says, such tests can also be used as a follow-up to treatment to confirm that the patient has remained drug-free. Treatment The last two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment. But like all forms of drug abuse, cocaine abuse/addiction is a multi- faceted phenomenon involving environmental, social, and familial as well as physiological factors. This greatly complicates the challenge of effectively treating cocaine addiction. Pharmacological treatments To date, no medications have been approved specifi- cally for treating cocaine addiction. But several were under development at this writing. Selegeline, delivered either via a time-release pill or a transdermal patch, shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication. Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (also used to treat alcoholics) to be effective in treating cocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant medications are sometimes used to control the mood swings associat- ed with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal. Behavioral approaches A wide range of behavioral interventions have been successfully used to treat cocaine addiction. The approach used must be tailored to the specific needs of each individual patient, however. Contingency management rewards drug abstinence (confirmed by urine testing) with points or vouchers which patients can exchange for such things as an evening out or membership in a gym. Cognitive-behav- ioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and avoid situations most likely to lead to cocaine use and to devel- op healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Resi- dential programs/therapeutic communities may also be helpful, particularly in more severe cases. Patients typi- cally spend six to 12 months in such programs, which may also include vocational training and other features. KEY TERMS Apoxia\u2014Apoxia refers to altitude sickness. Arrhythmia\u2014Irregular heartbeat. Central nervous system \u2014Part of the nervous sys- tem consisting of the brain, cranial nerves and spinal cord. The brain is the center of higher processes, such as thought and emotion and is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of informa- tion from the senses. The cranial nerves and spinal cord link the brain to the peripheral nervous sys- tem, that is the nerves present in the rest of body. Nasal septum \u2014The membrane that separates the nostrils. Neurotransmitter \u2014A chemical that carries nerve impulses across a synapse. Synapse\u2014The gap between two nerve cells. Alternative treatment Various alternative or complementary approaches have been used in treating cocaine addiction, often in combination with more conventional therapies. In Japan, the herb acorus has been traditionally used both to assist early-stage cocaine withdrawal and in later recovery stages. Other herbs sometimes used to treat drug addic- tions of various kinds include kola nut, guarana seed and yohimbe (to boost short-term energy), and valerian root, hops leaf, scullcap leaf, and chamomile (to calm the patient). The amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine have been used to reduce cocaine addicts\u2019 craving for the drug, and vitamin therapy may be used to help strengthen the patient. Gentle massage has been used to help infants born with congenital cocaine addiction. Other tech- niques, such as acupuncture , EEG biofeedback , and visualization, may also be useful in treating addiction. Prognosis Because addiction involves so many different factors, prospects for individual addicts vary widely. However, research has consistently shown that treatment can signifi- cantly reduce both drug abuse and subsequent criminal activity. The comprehensive Services Research Outcomes Study (1998) found a 45% drop in cocaine use five years after treatment, compared to use during the five years before treatment. The study also found that females generally respond better to treatment than males, and older patients tend to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Drug overdose Definition A drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine in an amount that is higher than is normally used. Description All drugs have the potential to be misused, whether legally prescribed by a doctor, purchased over-the- counter at the local drug store, or bought illegally on the street. Taken in combination with other drugs or with alcohol, even drugs normally considered safe can cause death or serious long term consequences. Children are particularly at risk for accidental overdose, accounting for over one million poisonings each year from drugs, alcohol, and other chemicals and toxic substances. Peo- ple who suffer from depression and who have suicidal thoughts are also at high risk for drug overdose. Causes and symptoms Accidental drug overdose may be the result of mis- use of prescription medicines or commonly used medica- tions like pain relievers and cold remedies. Symptoms differ depending on the drug taken. Some of the drugs commonly involved in overdoses are listed below along with symptoms and outcomes. Acetaminophen is the generic name for the com- monly used pain reliever Tylenol. Overdose of this drug causes liver damage with symptoms that include loss of appetite, tiredness, nausea and vomiting , paleness, and sweating. The next stage of symptoms indicates liver failure and includes abdominal pain and tenderness, swelling of the liver, and abnormal blood tests for liver enzymes. In the last stage of this poisoning, liver failure advances and the patient becomes jaundiced, with yel- lowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. They may also experience kidney failure, bleeding disorders, and encephalopathy (swelling of the brain). Anticholinergic drugs (drugs that block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) like atropine, scopo- lamine, belladonna, antihistamines , and antipsychotic agents cause the skin and moist tissues (like in the mouth and nose) to become dry and flushed. Dilated pupils, an inability to urinate, and mental disturbances are also symptoms. Severe toxicity can lead to seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, extremely high blood pressure, and coma. Antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline, desi- pramine, and nortriptyline can cause irregular heart rate, vomiting, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizures. An overdose of antidepressants also causes symptoms similar to those seen with anticholinergic drug overdoses. Cholinergic drugs (drugs that stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system) like carbamate and pilocarpine cause nausea, diarrhea, increased secretion of body fluids (sweat, tears, saliva, and urine), fatigue , and muscle weakness. Convulsions are possible. Death can occur due to respiratory failure and heart failure. Cocaine and crack cocaine overdoses cause seizures, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, paranoia, and other changes in behavior. Heart attack or stroke are serious risks within three days after cocaine overdose. Depressant drugs (tranquilizers, antianxiety drugs, sleeping pills) cause sleepiness, slowed or slurred speech, difficulty walking or standing, blurred vision, impaired ability to think, disorientation, and mood changes.

Symptoms that occur less often in alcoholic fatty liver, but more often in pregnancy related fatty liver, are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis During a physical examination, a doctor might notice that the liver is enlarged and tender when the abdomen is palpated (examined with the tips of the fingers while the patient lies flat). Blood tests may be used to determine if the liver is functioning properly. A liver biopsy, where a small sample of liver tissue is removed with a long needle or though a very small incision, can be used to confirm fatty liver. In pregnant women, the fatty liver condition is usually associated with another serious complication, pre- eclampsia or eclampsia. In this condition, the mother has seriously high blood pressure, swelling, and possibly, seizures. Laboratory abnormalities include elevations of the SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) and SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase). In many cases the alkaline phosphatase will be significantly elevat- ed due to cholestasisproduced by the fatty infiltration. Treatment Treatment involves correcting the condition that caused fatty liver and providing supportive care. In fatty liver caused by alcoholism, the treatment is to give up drinking alcohol and to eat a healthy, well balanced diet. In fatty liver associated with pregnancy, the recommend- ed treatment is to deliver the baby, if the pregnancy is far enough along. Vitamin and mineral supplements along with nutritional support may be useful. Prognosis Fatty liver is usually reversible if recognized and treated. There may be some long-term tendency toward other types of liver problems depending on how long and how severe the fatty liver condition was. In pregnant women with the condition, the situation can be life threatening for both the mother and the infant. Left untreated, there is a high risk of death for both the moth- er and baby. Severe liver damage that may require a liver transplant can occur in the mother if the condition is not recognized early. Prevention Prevention consists of maintaining a well balanced diet and healthy lifestyle with moderate or no alcohol consump- tion.

Pain or rigidity in the gallblad- der or pancreas suggest an extrahepatic form. Blood tests and liver function tests can reveal the pattern and extent of liver injury, indicate functional abnormalities, and establish the cause of the condition. However, most misdiagnoses occur when physicians rely more on laboratory analysis than on detailed medical his- tory and the results of a thorough physical examination. Special attention should be paid to three liver function tests. Levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can indicate whether the patient\u2019s condition is caused by an obstructive condition like cholestasis or a disease of the liver cells (hepatocellular disease) like viral hepatitis or cancer. ALP levels more than three times greater than normal indicate cholestasis. High lev- els of AST and particularly of ALT, which is found pre- dominantly in liver cells, indicate hepatocellular disease. Once the disease pattern has been established, ultra- sound may be performed to determine whether obstruc- tion of the large duct has caused widening of small ducts located close to it. Computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide more detailed information about the source of the obstruction. If these procedures that do not enter the patient\u2019s body (non-invasive procedures) do not provide the information a family physician, internist, or gastroen- terologist needs to make a diagnosis of cholestasis, one of these procedures may be performed: \u2022 direct cholangiography, an x-ray map of the bile ducts, enhanced by the use of contrast dye \u2022 percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, used to identify obstructions that impede the flow of bile from the liver to the digestive system, takes x-ray images of the bile ducts after a contrast dye has been injected by a needle passed directly into a hepatic duct \u2022 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which uses a special dye to outline the pancre- atic and common bile ducts and highlight the position of any obstruction; a special tube with a light transmit- ter is inserted into the duct and a series of x-ray images is taken A doctor who thinks a physical obstruction is responsible for progressive deterioration of a patient\u2019s condition may consider an exploratory surgical proce- dure (diagnostic laparotomy). Liver biopsy is sometimes performed if imaging tests do not indicate why a duct is enlarged, but results of a single biopsy may not represent the status of the entire organ. Treatment The goal of treatment is to eliminate or control the patient\u2019s symptoms. Discontinuing the use of certain drugs can restore normal liver function, but surgery may be needed to drain or remove obstructions or to widen affected ducts. Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), an antibacterial drug; phenobarbital, a barbiturate anticonvulsant; and other drugs are sometimes prescribed to cleanse the sys- tem and eliminate bile salts and other toxic compounds. Patients who have chronic cholestasis and have trou- ble digesting fat may have to restrict the amount of fat in their diet and take calcium and water-soluble vitamin supplements. A liver transplant may become necessary if complications occur. Prognosis Symptoms almost always disappear after the under- lying condition is controlled. Some patients who have cholestasis experience symp- toms only after infection develops, but chronic bile-duct obstruction always leads to cirrhosis. It may also cause osteoporosis(fragile bones) or osteomalacia (soft bones). Emergency care is not required unless inflammation of the bile ducts ( cholangitis ) develops. Cancer should be considered when an adult suddenly develops cholesta- sis after the age of 50. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med- icine. Philadelphia: W.

Paula Ford-Martin Fatty liver Definition Fatty liver is the collection of excessive amounts of triglycerides and other fats inside liver cells. Description Also called steatosis, fatty liver can be a temporary or long-term condition, which is not harmful itself, but may indicate some other type of problem. Left untreated, it can contribute to other illnesses. It is usually reversible once the cause of the problem is diagnosed and corrected. The liver is the organ responsible for changing fats eaten in the diet to types of fat that can be stored and used by the body. Triglycerides are one of the forms of fat stored by the body and used for energy and new cell formation. The break down of fats in the liver can be disrupted by alco- holism, malnutrition, pregnancy, or poisoning. In fatty liver, large droplets of fat, containing mostly triglycerides, collect within cells of the liver. The condition is generally not painful and may go unnoticed for a long period of time. In severe cases, the liver can increase to over three times its normal size and may be painful and tender. Causes and symptoms The most common cause of fatty liver in the United States is alcoholism. In alcoholic fatty liver, over con- sumption of alcohol changes the way that the liver breaks down and stores fats. Often, people with chronic alco- holism also suffer from malnutrition by eating irregularly and not consuming a balanced diet. Conditions that can also cause fatty liver are other forms of malnutrition (especially when there is not enough protein in the diet), obesity , diabetes mellitus , and Reye\u2019s syndrome in children. Pregnancy can cause a rare, but serious form of fatty liver that starts late in pregnancy and may be associ- ated with jaundice and liver failure. Some drug overdos- es or toxic chemical poisonings, such as carbon tetra- chloride, can also cause fatty liver. Often, there are no symptoms associated with fatty liver. If there are symptoms, they can include pain under the rib cage on the right side of the body, swelling of the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21298 Fatty liver",

          "content": "Cholesterol test Definition The cholesterol test is a quantitative analysis of the cholesterol levels in a sample of the patient\u2019s blood. Total serum cholesterol (TC) is the measurement routinely taken. Doctors sometimes order a complete lipoprotein profile to better evaluate the risk for atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease, or CAD). The full lipoprotein profile also includes measurements of triglyceride levels (a chemical compound that forms 95% of the fats and oils stored in ani- mal or vegetable cells) and lipoproteins (high density and low density). Blood fats are also called \u201clipids.\u201d The type of cholesterol in the blood is as important as the total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty substance and can- not be dissolved in water. It must combine with a protein molecule called a lipoprotein in order to be transported in the blood. There are five major types of lipoproteins in the human body; they differ in the amount of cholesterol that they carry in comparison to other fats and fatty acids, and in their functions in the body. Lipoproteins are classified, as follows, according to their density: \u2022 Chylomicrons. These are normally found in the blood only after a person has eaten foods containing fats. They contain about 7% cholesterol. Chylomicrons transport fats and cholesterol from the intestine into the liver and then into the bloodstream. They are metabo- lized in the process of carrying food energy to muscle and fat cells. \u2022 Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These lipopro- teins carry mostly triglycerides, but they also contain 16\u201322% cholesterol. VLDLs are made in the liver and eventually become IDL particles after they have lost their triglyceride content. \u2022 Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). IDLs are short-lived lipoproteins containing about 30% choles- terol that are converted in the liver to low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). \u2022 Low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL molecules carry cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues. They contain about 50% cholesterol. Extra LDLs are absorbed by the liver and their cholesterol is excreted into the bile. LDL particles are involved in the formation of plaques (abnormal deposits of cholesterol) in the walls of the coronary arteries. LDL is known as \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u2022 High-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL molecules are made in the intestines and the liver. HDLs are about 50% protein and 19% cholesterol. They help to remove cholesterol from artery walls. Lifestyle changes, including exercising, keeping weight within recom- mended limits, and giving up smoking can increase the body\u2019s levels of HDL cholesterol. HDL is known as \u201cgood cholesterol.\u201d Because of the difference in density and cholesterol content of lipoproteins, two patients with the same total cholesterol level can have very different lipid profiles and different risk for CAD. The critical factor is the level of HDL cholesterol in the blood serum. Some doctors use the ratio of the total cholesterol level to HDL choles- terol when assessing the patient\u2019s degree of risk. A low TC/HDL ratio is associated with a lower degree of risk. Purpose The purpose of the TC test is to measure the levels of cholesterol in the patient\u2019s blood. The patient\u2019s choles- terol can also be fractionated (separated into different portions) in order to determine the TC/HDL ratio. The results help the doctor to assess the patient\u2019s risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). High LDL levels are associated with increased risk of CAD whereas high HDL levels are associated with relatively lower risk. In addition, the results of the cholesterol test can assist the doctor in evaluating the patient\u2019s metabolism of fat, or in diagnosing inflammation of the pancreas, liver disease, or disorders of the thyroid gland. The frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the patient\u2019s degree of risk for CAD. People with low choles- terol levels may need to be tested once every five years. People with high levels of blood cholesterol should be tested more frequently, according to their doctor\u2019s advice. The doctor may recommend a detailed evaluation of the different types of lipids in the patient\u2019s blood. It is ideal to check the HDL and triglycerides as well as the cholesterol and LDL. In addition, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) suggests further evaluation if the patient has any of the symptoms of CAD or if she or he has two or more of the following risk factors for CAD: \u2022 male sex \u2022 high blood pressure \u2022 smoking \u2022 diabetes \u2022 low HDL levels \u2022 family history of CAD before age 55 Precautions Patients who are seriously ill or hospitalized for surgery should not be given cholesterol tests because the results will not indicate the patient\u2019s normal cholesterol level. Acute illness, high fever, starvation , or recent surgery lowers blood cholesterol levels. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 792 Cholesterol test",

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

Tish Davidson Cholestasis Definition Cholestasis is a condition caused by rapidly devel- oping (acute) or long-term (chronic) interruption in the excretion of bile (a digestive fluid that helps the body process fat). The term is taken from the Greek chole, bile, and stasis, standing still. Description Cholestasis is caused by obstruction within the liver (intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic). The obstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment bilirubin, and fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood stream instead of being eliminated normally. Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by wide- spread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such as hepatitis, that impair the body\u2019s ability to eliminate bile. Extrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect of many medications. It can also occur as a complication of surgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, or intravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can be caused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones that block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Pregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile ducts to estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the sec- ond and third trimesters of pregnancy. This condition is the second most common cause of jaundice during preg- nancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is the only symptom most women experience. Cholestasis of pregnancy tends to run in families. Symptoms usually disappear within two to four weeks after the baby\u2019s birth but may reappear if the woman becomes pregnant again. A similar condition affects some women who take birth-control pills. Symptoms disappear after the woman stops using oral contraceptives. This condition does not lead to chronic liver disease. A woman who develops cholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy or birth control hormones) has an increased risk of develop- ing cholestasis from the other. Benign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condi- tion characterized by brief, repeated episodes of itching and jaundice. Symptoms often disappear. This condition does not cause cirrhosis. Drug-induced cholestasis may be a complication of chemotherapy or other medications. The two major types of drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic injury and reactions unique to an individual (idiosyncratic reactions). In direct toxic injury, the severity of symptoms parallels the amount of medication involved. This condition: \u2022 develops a short time after treatment begins \u2022 follows a predictable pattern \u2022 usually causes liver damage Direct toxic reactions develop in 1% of all patients who take chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a tranquilizer and antinausea drug. Idiosyncratic reactions may occur at the onset of treatment or at a later time. Allergic responses are varied and are not related to the amount of medica- tion being taken. Causes and symptoms Intrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepati- tis or by medications that can produce symptoms resem- bling hepatitis. Phenothiazine-derivative drugs, including chlorpromazine, can cause sudden fever and inflamma- tion. Symptoms usually disappear after use of the drug(s) is stopped. In rare cases, a condition resembling chronic biliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized by destruction of small bile ducts) persists even after the medication is stopped. Some patients experience a simi- lar reaction in response to tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine), phenylbutazone (Butazo- lidin), erythromycin estolate (Estomycin, Purmycin), and other drugs. Intrahepatic cholestasis may also be caused by alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis , cancer that has spread (metastasized) from another part of the body, and a number of rare disorders. Extrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a stone obstructing the passage through which bile travels from the gallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or by pancreatic cancer. Less often, the condition occurs as a result of non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures), ductal carcinoma, or disorders of the pancreas. Cholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes lit- tle, if any, inflammation. Symptoms develop gradually GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 783 Cholestasis",

The resulting blockage restricts blood flow to the heart. When the blood flow is completely cut off, the result is a heart attack. Description Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart disease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8 deaths in the United States was caused by coronary artery disease. About every 29 seconds, one American will have a heart attack; about every minute, one American will die from a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans have active symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attack or chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronary disease, the first indication of which can be sudden death. Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary arteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block- age limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries, which are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood to the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heart is working harder and needs more oxygen. Arteries would expand, for example, when a person is climbing stairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unable to expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardial ischemia ). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or pressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage cuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack (myocardial infarction or heart muscle death). Healthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and slick. The artery walls are flexible and can expand to let more blood through when the heart needs to work harder. The disease process in arteries is thought to begin with an injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. This injury makes them susceptible to atherosclerosis and blood clots (thrombosis). Causes and symptoms Coronary artery disease is usually caused by athero- sclerosis. Cholesterol and other fatty substances accumu- late on the inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibrous tissue, blood components, and calcium and harden into artery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques often form blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries (coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and muscle spasms can also block blood flow. Recent research indi- cates that infection from organisms such as chlamydia bacteria may be responsible for some cases of coronary artery disease. A number of major contributing factors increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease. Some of these can be changed and some cannot. People with more risk factors are more likely to develop coronary artery disease. Major risk factors Major risk factors significantly increase the chance of developing coronary artery disease. Those that cannot be changed are: \u2022 Heredity\u2014People whose parents have coronary artery disease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri- cans are also at increased risk because they experience a higher rate of severe hypertension than whites do. \u2022 Sex\u2014Men are more likely to have heart attacks than women are and to have them at a younger age. Over age 60, however, women have coronary artery disease at a rate equal to that of men. \u2022 Age\u2014Men who are 45 years of age and older and women who are 55 years of age and older are more likely to have coronary artery disease. Occasionally, coronary disease may strike a person in the 30s. Older people (those over 65) are more likely to die of a heart attack. Older women are twice as likely as older men to die within a few weeks of a heart attack. Major risk factors that can be changed are: \u2022 Smoking\u2014Smoking increases both the chance of developing coronary artery disease and the chance of dying from it. Smokers are two to four times more like- ly than are non-smokers to die of sudden heart attack. They are more than twice as likely as non-smokers to have a heart attack. They are also more likely to die within an hour of a heart attack. Second hand smoke may also increase risk. \u2022 High cholesterol\u2014Dietary sources of cholesterol are meat, eggs, and other animal products. The body also produces it. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect one\u2019s blood cholesterol. Total blood cholesterol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200- 239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130\u2013159 mg/dL, depending on other risk factors. Risk of developing coronary artery disease increases steadily as blood cholesterol levels increase above 160 mg/dL. When a person has other risk factors, the risk multiplies. \u2022 High blood pressure\u2014High blood pressure makes the heart work harder and weakens it over time. It increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and con- gestive heart failure. A blood pressure of 140 over 90 or above is considered high. As the numbers rise, high blood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to Stage 4 (very severe). In combination with obesity, smoking, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 929 Coronary artery disease",

          "content": "Causes and symptoms As of 2001, the two leading causes of death for both men and women in the United States were heart disease and cancer. Accidental death was a distant third fol- lowed by such problems as stroke, chronic lung disor- ders, pneumonia, suicide, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus , and murder. The order of these causes of death varies among persons of different age, ethnicity, and gender. Diagnosis In an age of organ transplantation, identifying the moment of death may now involve another life. It there- by takes on supreme legal importance. It is largely due to the need for transplant organs that death has been so pre- cisely defined. The official signs of death include the following: \u2022 no pupil reaction to light \u2022 no response of the eyes to caloric (warm or cold) stimu- lation \u2022 no jaw reflex (the jaw will react like the knee if hit with a reflex hammer) \u2022 no gag reflex (touching the back of the throat induces vomiting) \u2022 no response to pain \u2022 no breathing \u2022 a body temperature above 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), which elimi- nates the possibility of resuscitation following cold- water drowning \u2022 no other cause for the above, such as a head injury \u2022 no drugs present in the body that could cause apparent death \u2022 all of the above for 12 hours \u2022 all of the above for six hours and a flat-line electroen- cephalogram (brain wave study) \u2022 no blood circulating to the brain, as demonstrated by angiography Current ability to resuscitate people who have \u201cdied\u201d has produced some remarkable stories.

Treatment Only recently has there been concerted public effort to address the care of the dying in an effort to improve their comfort and lessen their alienation from those still living. Hospice care represents one of the greatest ELISABETH K\u00dcBLER-ROSS (1926\u2013 ) Contemporary physician who has become a world authority on the subject of death and after-death states. Born in Switzerland on July 8, 1926, she worked as a country doctor before moving to the United States. Dur- ing World War II she spent weekends at the Kantonspital (Cantonai Hospital) in Z\u00fcrich, where she volunteered to assist escaped refugees. After the war she visited Maj- danek concentration camp, where the horrors of the death chambers stimulated in her a desire to help peo- ple facing death and to understand the human impulses of love and destruction. She extended her medical background by becoming a practicing psychiatrist. Her formal work with dying patients began in 1965 when she was a faculty member at the University of Chicago. She also conducted research on basic questions con- cerning life after death at the Manhattan State Hospital, New York. Her studies of death and dying have involved accounts by patients who reported out-of-the-body trav- el. Her research tends to show that while dying can be painful, death itself is a peaceful condition. Her 1969 text, On Death and Dying, was hailed by her colleagues and also became a popular best-seller. In 1978 K\u00fcbler-Ross helped to found Shanti Nilaya (Final Home of Peace), a healing and growth center in Escondido, California. This was an extension of her well-known \u201cLife-Death and Transition\u201d workshops conducted in various parts of the United States and Canada, involving physicians, nurses, social workers, laypeople, and terminally ill patients. Much of K\u00fcbler- Ross\u2019s later research was directed toward proving the existence of life after death. Her publication To Live Until We Say Good-bye (1979) was both praised as a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d and criticized as \u201cprettifying\u201d the real situation. She has also dealt with issues such as AIDS and \u201cnear death\u201d experiences. In the mid-1980s Shanti Nilaya moved from San Diego County, Califor- nia, to Head Waters, Virginia, where it continues to offer courses and short- and long-term therapeutic sessions. advances made in this direction. There has also been a liberalization of the use of narcotics and other drugs for symptomatic relief and improvement in the quality of life for the dying.

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurally mediated hypotension , causes a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person has been standing, exercising or exposed to heat for a while.

          "content": "Description Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feel- ings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical and mental deterioration, they become what are known as depressive disorders. Each year in the United States, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17 million people at an approximate annual direct and indirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like- ly to experience an episode of severe depression in her lifetime, with a 10\u201320% lifetime prevalence, com- pared to 5\u201310% for men. The average age a first depressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, although the disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately, from children to the elderly. There are two main categories of depressive disor- ders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depressive disorder is a moderate to severe episode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi- viduals experiencing this major depressive episode may have trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they once took pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif- ficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, or have a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children, the major depression may appear as irritability. While major depressive episodes may be acute (intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo- ing, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (one or more years in children) and has an average duration of 16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymic disorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflicted with the disorder may experience some periods of nor- mal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length. Its onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not be able to pinpoint exactly when they started feeling depressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder may experience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, low self-esteem, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness. Depression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n affective mental illness that causes radical emotional changes and mood swings, from manic highs to depres- sive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. Causes and symptoms The causes behind depression are complex and not yet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu- rotransmitters\u2014the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cell\u2014 is believed to be key to depression, external factors such as upbringing (more so in dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor- tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is abused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles- cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking may emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depression may follow. Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops depressive disorders. Individuals with major depression in their immediate family are up to three times more likely to have the disorder themselves. It would seem that biological and genetic factors may make certain individuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor- ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig- ger the disorder. External stressors and significant life changes, such as chronic medical problems, death of a loved one, divorce or estrangement, miscarriage , or loss of a job, can also result in a form of depression known as adjust- ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder usually resolve themselves, occasionally they may evolve into a major depressive disorder. Major depressive episode Individuals experiencing a major depressive episode have a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest or pleasure in activities. Children experiencing a major depressive episode may appear or feel irritable rather than depressed. In addition, five or more of the following symptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri- od of at least two weeks: \u2022 Significant change in weight. \u2022 Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep). \u2022 Psychomotor agitation or retardation. \u2022 Fatigue or loss of energy. \u2022 Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt. \u2022 Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci- siveness. \u2022 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal and/or suicide attempts.

Immunocompromised patients may develop repeated episodes of passage of bacteria into the bloodstream from these sites of infection. \u2022 The gallbladder, pancreas, and bone may be affected. Diagnosis Campylobacter is only one of many causes of acute diarrhea. Culture (growing the bacteria in the laboratory) of freshly obtained diarrhea fluid is the only way to be certain of the diagnosis. Treatment The first aim of treatment is to keep up nutrition and avoid dehydration. Medications used to treat diar- rhea by decreasing intestinal motility, such as Lop- eramide or Diphenoxylate are also useful, but should only be used with the advice of a physician. Antibiotics are of value, if started within three days of onset of symptoms. They are indicated for those with severe or persistent symptoms. Either an erythromycin type drug or one of the fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) for five to seven days are the accepted therapies. Prognosis Most patients with Campylobacter infection rapidly recover without treatment. For certain groups of patients, infection becomes chronic and requires repeated courses of antibiotics. Prevention Good hand washing technique as well as proper preparation and cooking of food is the best way to pre- vent infection.

David Kaminstein, MD Cancer Definition Cancer is not just one disease, but a large group of almost one hundred diseases. Its two main characteristics are uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human body and the ability of these cells to migrate from the original site and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not con- trolled, cancer can result in death. Description One out of every four deaths in the United States is from cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a cause of death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 die of cancer annually. Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of cancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases are seen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent of all cancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65 years of age. The most common cancers are skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer , breast cancer (in women), and prostate cancer (in men). In addition, cancer of the kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, and blood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lym- phomas) are also included among the 12 major cancers that affect most Americans.

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test.

          "content": "ahead of time, a living will is an attempt to address this dilemma. By outlining the conditions under which one would rather be allowed to die, a person can contribute significantly to that final decision, even if not competent to do so at the time of actual death. The problem is that there are uncertainties surrounding every severely ill person. Each instance presents a greater or lesser chance of survival. The chance is often greater than zero. The best living will follows an intimate discussion with deci- sion makers covering the many possible scenarios sur- rounding the end of life. This discussion is difficult, for few people like to contemplate their own demise. How- ever, the benefits of a living will are substantial, both to physicians and to loved ones who are faced with making final decisions. Most states have passed living will laws, honoring instructions on artificial life support that were made while a person was still mentally competent. Euthanasia Another issue that has received much attention is assisted suicide (euthanasia). In 1997, the State of Ore- gon placed the issue on the ballot, amid much consterna- tion and dispute. Perhaps the main reason euthanasia has become front page news is because Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a pathologist from Michigan, is one of its most vocal advo- cates. The issue highlights the many new problems gen- erated by increasing ability to intervene effectively in the final moments of life and unnaturally prolong the process of dying. The public appearance of euthanasia has also stimulated discussion about more compassionate care of the dying. KEY TERMS Angiography\u2014X rays of blood vessels filled with a contrast agent.

A pathologist extensively examines a body and submits a detailed report to an attending physician. Although an autopsy can do nothing for an individual after death, it can benefit the family and, in some cases, medical science. Heredi- tary disorders and disease may be found. This knowledge could be used to prevent illness in other family members. Information culled from an autopsy can be used to fur- ther medical research. The link between smoking and lung cancer was confirmed from data gathered through autopsy. Early information about AIDS was also com- piled through autopsy reports. Resources BOOKS Finkbeiner, J.

It can usually be given by mouth, although in severe cases (or in cases of diagnosed bacteremia) it may be given through a needle placed in a vein (intravenously). Even with antibiotic treatment, swelling may contin- ue to spread. Other symptoms, such as fever, pain, and redness, usually decrease rapidly after penicillin is start- ed. Cold packs and pain relievers may help decrease dis- comfort. Within about five to 10 days, the affected skin may begin drying up and flaking off. Prognosis With prompt treatment, the prognosis from erysi- pelas is excellent. Delay of treatment, however, increases the chance for bacteremia and the potential for death from overwhelming sepsis. This is particularly true of people with weakened immune systems (babies, the elderly, and people ill with other diseases, especially Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS). Fre- quently, an individual who has had erysipelas will have it occur again in the same location.

Description Erythema multiforme appears on the skin and the mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, digestive tract, vagina, and other organs). Large, symmetrical red blotches appear all over the skin in a circular pattern. On mucous membranes, it begins as blisters and progresses to ulcers. A more advanced form, called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, can be severe and even fatal. Causes and symptoms Erythema multiforme has many causes, most com- monly are drugs. Penicillin,sulfonamides, certain epilep- sy drugs, aspirin, and acetaminophen are the most likely medication-induced causes. Erythema multiforme can also be caused by certain diseases. Herpes virus and mycoplasma pneumonia are likely infectious causes. Diagnosis The appearance of the rash is sufficiently unique to identify it on sight. Having identified it, the physician will determine the underlying cause. Treatment Erythema multiforme is inadvertently treated when the causative agent, whether it be a drug or a disease, is treated. In severe cases, cortisone-like medication is often used along with general supportive measures and prevention of infection. Prognosis As a rule, the rash abates by itself without damaging the skin. Only in the case of infection, severe blistering, or continued use of an offending drug does complica- tions occur. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds.

          "content": "Treatment Choice of treatment for encephalitis will depend on the cause. Bacterial encephalitis is treated with antibi- otics. Viral encephalitis is usually treated with antiviral drugs including acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, ribo- varin, and AZT. Viruses that respond to acyclovir include herpes simplex, the most common cause of sporadic (non-epidemic) encephalitis in the United States. The symptoms of encephalitis may be treated with a number of different drugs. Corticosteroids , including prednisone and dexamethasone, are sometimes pre- scribed to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. Anti- convulsant drugs, including dilantin and phenytoin, are used to control seizures. Fever may be reduced with acetaminophen or other fever-reducing drugs. A person with encephalitis must be monitored care- fully, since symptoms may change rapidly. Blood tests may be required regularly to track levels of fluids and salts in the blood. Prognosis Encephalitis symptoms may last several weeks. Most cases of encephalitis are mild, and recovery is usu- ally quick. Mild encephalitis usually leaves no residual neurological problems. Overall, approximately 10% of those with encephalitis die from their infections or com- plications such as secondary infection. Some forms of encephalitis have more severe courses, including herpes encephalitis, in which mortality is 15\u201320% with treat- ment, and 70\u201380% without. Antiviral treatment is inef- fective for eastern equine encephalitis, and mortality is approximately 30%. Permanent neurological consequences may follow recovery in some cases. Consequences may include per- sonality changes, memory loss, language difficulties, seizures, and partial paralysis. Prevention Because encephalitis is due to infection, it may be prevented by avoiding the infection. Minimizing contact with others who have any of the viral illness listed above may reduce the chances of becoming infected. Most infections are spread by hand-to-hand or hand-to-mouth contact; frequent hand washing may reduce the likeli- hood of infection if contact cannot be avoided. Mosquito-borne viruses may be avoided by prevent- ing mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk, and are most common in moist areas with standing water. Minimizing exposed skin and use of mosquito repellents on other areas can reduce the chances of being bitten. KEY TERMS Cerebrospinal fluid analysis \u2014A analysis that is important in diagnosing diseases of the central nervous system. The fluid within the spine will indicate the presence of viruses, bacteria, and blood. Infections such as encephalitis will be indi- cated by an increase of cell count and total pro- tein in the fluid. Computerized tomography (CT) Scan \u2014A test to examine organs within the body and detect evi- dence of tumors, blood clots, and accumulation of fluids. Electroencephalagram (EEG)\u2014A chart of the brain waves picked up by the electrodes placed on the scalp. Changes in brain wave activity can be an indication of nervous system disorders. Inflammation\u2014A response from the immune sys- tem to an injury. The signs are redness, heat, swelling, and pain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\u2014MRI is diag- nostic radiography using electromagnetic energy to create an image of the central nervous system (CNS), blood system, and musculoskeletal system. Vaccine\u2014A prepartation containing killed or weakened microorganisms used to build immuni- ty against infection from that microorganism. Virus\u2014A very small organism that can only live within a cell. They are unable to reproduce out- side that cell. Vaccines are available against some viruses, includ- ing polio, herpes B, Japanese encephalitis, and equine encephalitis. Rabies vaccine is available for animals; it is also given to people after exposure. Japanese encephalitis vaccine is recommended for those traveling to Asia and staying in affected rural areas during transmission season.

Treatment Initial treatment may consist of resting the knee using crutches, along with aspirin , Tylenol, or a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Motrin for seven to 10 days. The person should limit sports activity until the joint is healed and may use ice followed by heat to decrease inflammation. When the doctor allows the patient to resume sports, a knee brace may be prescribed in the form of a stabilizer with a hole at the kneecap. Treatment also includes low impact exercises to strengthen the quadriceps muscles which help stabilize the knee joint. Physical therapy may be suggested at the start of this program so as to help the patient learn the correct method of performing the exercises. Approximately 85% of people do well with conserv- ative CMP treatment. The remainder still have severe pain and may require arthroscopic surgery to repair the tissues inside the knee joint. In more severe cases, open surgery may be required to realign the kneecap and per- haps other corrections. Alternative treatments Physical therapy offers treatments that may help CMP patients. Aqua therapy has the benefit of exercising the knee without putting stress on it and it also strength- ens the thigh muscles. Biofeedback can be used to learn tensing and relaxing specific muscles to relieve pain. These techniques have the benefit of no side effects. Massage therapy might be beneficial as well. Calcium, minerals , and vitamins as part of a balanced diet will aid healing and help prevent further problems. KEY TERMS Arthroscopic knee surgery\u2014Surgery performed to examine or repair tissues inside the knee joint through a special scope (arthroscope). Femur\u2014The thigh bone. Isometric exercises \u2014Exercises which strengthen through muscle resistance. Osteoarthritis\u2014Degenerative joint disease. Quadriceps, hip flexors, hamstrings\u2014Major mus- cles in the thigh area which affect knee mechanics. Prognosis In most teens with CMP, the prognosis is excellent since the damage is reversible when treatment starts before the cartilage begins to break down. With proper treatment and preventive techniques, teenagers will com- plete their growth without permanent damage to the joint. Only about 15% of patients require surgical inter- vention. Older people may go on to develop osteoarthri- tis in the knee. Prevention Proper exercises are the best preventive measure. Since tightness of thigh muscles is a risk factor, warming up before athletic activities is recommended, as well as participating in a variety of sports rather than just one. Stretching exercises increase flexibility of the quadri- ceps, hip flexors, and hamstrings. Strengthening exercis- es such as short arc leg extensions, straight leg raises, quadriceps isometric exercises, and stationary bicycling are also recommended.

A doctor should be notified if: \u2022 pustules spread after treatment has begun or reappear after treatment is completed \u2022 the patient\u2019s fever climbs above 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) \u2022 the patient develops boils or swollen ankles \u2022 redness, swelling, warmth, or pain indicate that the infection has spread \u2022 unexplained new symptoms appear Alternative treatment Eating a balanced diet, including protein, complex car- bohydrates, healthy fats, fresh fruits and vegetables, and drinking eight to 10 glasses of water a day may stimulate the body\u2019s immune system and shorten the course of the infection. Garlic ( Allium sativum ) and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), both antiseptic agents against staph infections, may be taken. The daily dosage would vary from person to person and is based on the severity of the infection. Echinacea (Echinacea spp.) is helpful in modu- lating immune function. Again, the dosage would vary. Daily doses of 30\u201350 mg zinc and 1,000\u20135,000 mg Vitamin C (taken in equal amounts at several times dur- ing the day), and 300\u20132,000 mg bioflavinoids can also strengthen the body\u2019s infection-fighting ability. High doses of vitamins and minerals should not be used with- out a doctor\u2019s approval. Prognosis If properly treated, the symptoms of bacterial folli- culitis generally disappear in about two weeks. Fungal folliculitis should clear up within six weeks. But it can worsen if the condition is misdiagnosed and inappropri- ately treated with steroid creams. Prevention Anyone who has a tendency to develop folliculitis should cleanse the skin with antibacterial soap twice a day and before shaving and should not use oily skin lotions. Men should not shave while the beard area is infected. When they begin shaving again, they should use a new blade each time. Women who have had fungal fol- liculitis should use depilatory creams instead of razors. Daily shampooing can help prevent folliculitis in the scalp.

          "content": "begin with chills, headache, and fever between three months and one year after the insect bite. There may also be swelling, redness, and pain in the arms, legs, or scro- tum. Areas of pus (abscesses) may appear as a result of dying worms or a secondary bacterial infection. Diagnosis The disease is diagnosed by taking a patient history, performing a physical examination , and by screening blood specimens for specific proteins produced by the immune system in response to this infection (antibodies). Early diagnosis may be difficult because, in the first stages, the disease mimics other bacterial skin infections. To make an accurate diagnosis, the physician looks for a pattern of inflammation and signs of lymphatic obstruc- tion, together with the patient\u2019s possible exposure to filariasis in an area where filariasis is common. The lar- vae (microfilariae) can also be found in the blood, but because mosquitos, which spread the disease, are active at night, the larvae are usually only found in the blood between about 10 pm and 2 am. Treatment Either ivermectin, albendazole, or diethylcarba- mazine is used to treat a filariasis infection by eliminat- ing the larvae, impairing the adult worms\u2019 ability to reproduce, and by actually killing adult worms. Unfortu- nately, much of the tissue damage may not be reversible. The medication is started at low doses to prevent reac- tions caused by large numbers of dying parasites. While effective, the medications can cause severe side effects in up to 70% of patients as a result either of the drug itself or the massive death of parasites in the blood. Diethylcarbamazine, for example, can cause severe allergic reactions and the formation of pus-filled sores (abscesses). These side effects can be controlled using antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs (cor- ticosteroids). Rarely, treatment with diethylcarbamazine in someone with very high levels of parasite infection may lead to a fatal inflammation of the brain (encephali- tis). In this case, the fever is followed by headache and confusion, then stupor and coma caused when massive numbers of larvae and parasites die. Other common drug reactions include dizziness, weakness, and nausea. Symptoms caused by the death of the parasites include fever, headache, muscle pain, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weakness, dizziness, lethargy, and asthma. Reactions usually begin within two days of start- ing treatment and may last between two and four days. No treatment can reverse elephantiasis. Surgery may be used to remove surplus tissue and provide a way to drain the fluid around the damaged lymphatic vessels. Surgery may also be used to ease massive enlargement of the scro- tum. Elephantiasis of the legs can also be helped by elevat- ing the legs and providing support with elastic bandages. Prognosis The outlook is good in early or mild cases, especially if the patient can avoid being infected again. The disease is rarely fatal, and with continued WHO medical inter- vention, even gross elephantiasis is now becoming rare. Prevention The best method of preventing filariasis is to prevent being repeatedly bitten by the mosquitoes that carry the disease. Some methods of preventing insect bites include the following: \u2022 limit outdoor activities at night, particularly in rural or jungle areas \u2022 wear long sleeves and pants and avoid dark-colored clothing that attracts mosquitoes \u2022 avoid perfumes and colognes \u2022 treat one or two sets of clothing ahead of time with per- methrin (Duramon, Permanone) \u2022 wear DEET insect repellent or, especially for children, try citronella or lemon eucalyptus, to repel insects \u2022 if sleeping in an open area or in a room with poor screens, use a bed net to avoid being bitten while asleep \u2022 use air conditioning, the cooler air makes insects less active In addition, filariasis can be controlled in highly infest- ed areas by taking ivermectin preventatively before being bitten. Currently, there is no vaccine available, but scien- tists are working on a preventative vaccine at this time. Resources BOOKS Infectious Disease. Ed. Barbara A. Bannister, et al.

Some possible causes include AIDS (Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma) or increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays which may lead to skin cancer. Diagnosis An instrument called a slit lamp is generally used to magnify the structures of the eyes. The doctor may press on the lid margin to see if oil can be expressed from the meibomian glands. The doctor may invert the lid to see the inside of the lid. Biopsy is used to diagnose cancer- ous tumors. Treatment Stye Styes are treated with warm-hot compresses for 10\u201315 minutes, three to four times a day. Sometimes top- ical antibiotics may be prescribed. If the initial treatment is ineffective, styes are lanced and drained. Chalazion About 25% of chalazia will disappear spontaneous- ly, but hot compresses may speed the process. Because chalazia are inside the lid, topical medications are gener- ally of no benefit. Medication may need to be injected by the doctor into the chalazion or if that doesn\u2019t help the chalazion may need to be excised. If what appears to be a chalazion recurs on the same site as any previous one, the possibility of sebaceous gland carcinoma should be investigated by biopsy. Blepharitis Blepharitis is treated with hot compresses, with antibiotic ointment, and by cleaning the eyelids with a moist washcloth and then with baby shampoo. Good hygiene is essential. If the blepharitis doesn\u2019t clear up with treatment or if it seems to be a chronic problem, the patient may have acnerosacea. These patients may need to see a dermatologist as well. Entropion and ectropion Both entropion and ectropion can be surgically cor- rected. Prior to surgery, the lower lid of entropion can be taped down to keep the lashes off the eye, and both can be treated with lubricating drops to keep the cornea moist. Eyelid edema Patients with swollen eyelids should contact their eye doctor. A severely swollen lid can press on the eye and possibly increase the intraocular pressure. An infec- tion needs to be ruled out. Or, something as simple as an allergy to nail polish and then touching the eyes can cause swelling. The best treatment for allergic eyelid edema is to find and remove the substance causing the allergy. When that is not possible, as in the case of plant allergens, cold compresses and immunosuppresesive drugs such as corticosteroid creams are helpful. Howev- er, steroids can cause cataracts and increase intraocular pressure and patients must be very careful not to get the cream in their eyes. This should not be done unless under a doctor\u2019s care. For edema caused by trichinosis, the trichinosis must be treated. Eyelid tumors Cancerous tumors should be removed upon discov- ery, and noncancerous tumors should be removed before they become big enough to interfere with vision or eyelid function. Eyelid tumors require special consideration because of their sensitive location. It is important that treatment not compromise vision, eye movement, or eye- lid movement. Accordingly, eyelid reconstruction will sometimes accompany tumor excision. Prognosis The prognosis for styes and chalazia is good to excellent. With treatment, blepharitis, ectropion, and entropion usually have good outcomes. The prognosis for nonmalignant tumors, basal cell carcinoma, and squa- mous cell carcinoma is good once they are properly removed. Survival rate for malignant melanoma depends upon how early it was discovered and if it was complete- ly removed. Sebaceous carcinomas are difficult to detect, so poor outcomes are more frequent.

          "content": "Chalazion A chalazion is an enlargement of a meibomian gland (an oil-producing gland in the eyelid), usually not associ- ated with an infectious agent. More likely, the gland opening is clogged. Initially, a chalazion may resemble a stye, but it usually grows larger. A chalazion may also be located in the middle of the lid and be internal. Blepharitis Blepharitis is the inflammation of the eyelid mar- gins, often with scales and crust. It can lead to eyelash loss, chalazia, styes, ectropion, corneal damage, exces- sive tearing, and chronic conjunctivitis. Entropion Entropion is a condition where the eyelid margin (usually the lower one) is turned inward; the eyelashes touch the eye and irritate the cornea. Ectropion Ectropion is a condition where one or both eyelid margins turn outward, exposing both the conjunctiva that covers the eye and the conjunctiva that lines the eyelid. Eyelid edema Eyelid edema is a condition where the eyelids con- tain excessive fluid. Eyelid tumors Eyelids are susceptible to the same skin tumors as the skin over the rest of the body, including noncancer- ous tumors and cancerous tumors (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma , and sebaceous gland carcinoma). Eyelid muscles are suscep- tible to sarcoma. Causes and symptoms Stye Styes are usually caused by bacterial staphylococcal infections. The symptoms are pain and inflammation in one or more localized regions near the eyelid margin. Chalazion A chalazion is caused by a blockage in the outflow duct of a meibomian gland. Symptoms are inflammation and swelling in the form of a round lump in the lid that may be painful. Blepharitis Some cases of blepharitis are caused by bacterial infection and some by head lice, but in some cases, the cause is unclear. It may also be caused by an overproduc- tion of oil by the meibomian glands. Blepharitis can be a chronic condition that begins in early childhood and can last throughout life. Symptoms can include itching, burn- ing, a feeling that something is in the eye, inflammation, and scales or matted, hard crusts surrounding the eyelashes. Entropion Entropion usually results from aging, but sometimes can be due to a congenital defect, a spastic eyelid muscle, or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be from surgery, injury, or disease. It is accompanied by exces- sive tearing, redness, and discomfort. Ectropion Similar to entropion, the usual cause of ectropion is aging. It also can be due to a spastic eyelid muscle or a scar, as in entropion. It also can be the result of allergies. Symptoms are excessive tearing and hardening of the eyelid conjunctiva. Eyelid edema Eyelid edema is most often caused by allergic reac- tions, for example, allergies to eye makeup, eyedrops or other drugs, or plant allergens such as pollen. Trichinosis, a disease caused by eating undercooked meat, also causes eyelid edema. However, swelling can also be caused by more serious causes, such as infection, and can lead to orbital cellulitis which can threaten vision. Symptoms can include swelling, itching, redness, or pain. Eyelid tumors Tumors found on the eyelids are caused by the same conditions that cause these tumors elsewhere on the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1271 Eyelid disorders A chalazion on the eyelid.This condition is caused by an obstruction of one of the meibomian glands which lubricate the edge of the eyelid.

An oph- thalmologist or optometrist should be consulted. Prevention Good lid hygiene is very important. Regular eyelid washing with baby shampoo helps prevent styes, cha- lazia, blepharitis, and eyelid edema. To avoid these prob- lems, it\u2019s also important to refrain from touching and rubbing the eyes and eyelids, especially with hands that have not just been washed. Blepharitis is associated with dandruff, which is caused by a kind of bacteria that is one of the causes of blepharitis. Controlling dandruff by washing the hair, scalp, and eyebrows with shampoo containing selenium sulfide to kill the bacteria helps control the blepharitis. When using anything near the eyes, it is important to read the label or consult with a doctor first. Avoiding allergens helps prevent allergic eyelid edema. Staying inside as much as possible when pollen counts are high and eliminating the use of, or at least removing eye makeup thoroughly, or using hypo-aller- genic makeup may help if the person is sensitive to those substances. Sunscreen, UV-blocking sunglasses, and wide brim- med hats can help prevent eyelid tumors. Entropian and ectropian seem to be unpreventable. Resources BOOKS Newell, Frank W.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries.

Tish Davidson Chest radiography see Chest x ray Chest x ray Definition A chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate organs and structures within the chest for symptoms of disease. Chest x rays include views of the lungs, heart, small por- tions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and the bones of the chest area. X rays are a form of radiation that can penetrate the body and produce an image on an x-ray film. Another name for x ray is radiograph. Purpose Chest x rays are ordered for a wide variety of diag- nostic purposes. In fact, this is probably the most frequent- ly performed x ray. In some cases, chest x rays are ordered for a single check of an organ\u2019s condition, and at other times, serial x rays are ordered to compare to previous studies. Some common reasons for chest x rays include: Pulmonary disorders Chest films are frequently ordered to diagnose or rule out pneumonia. Other pulmonary disorders such as emphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in the chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected or evaluated through the use of chest x ray. Cancer A chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to check for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoid tissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be primary tumors. X rays also check for secondary spread of can- cer from one organ to another. Cardiac disorders While less sensitive than echocardiography, chest x ray can be used to check for disorders such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.

          "content": "monitors in the chest area from the patient\u2019s placement during the exam. Normal results A radiologist, or physician specially trained in the technique and interpretation of x rays, will evaluate the results. A normal chest x ray will show normal structures for the age and medical history or the patient. Findings, whether normal or abnormal, will be provided to the referring physician in the form of a written report. Abnormal results Abnormal findings on chest x rays are used in con- junction with a physician\u2019s physical exam findings, patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to reach a final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays are more effective when compared to previous chest studies. The patient is asked to help the radiology facility in locating previous chest radiographs from other facilities. Pulmonary disorders Pneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches and irregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs). If the bronchi, which are usually not visible, can be seen, a diagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may be made. Shifts or shadows in the hila (lung roots) may indicate emphysema or a pulmonary abscess. Widening of the spaces between ribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases may also be detected or suspected through chest x ray. Cancer In nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort of abnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph. Hilar masses (enlargements at that part of the lungs where ves- sels and nerves enter) are one of the more common symptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid buildup on the outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas. Interstitial lung disease, which is a large category of dis- orders, many of which are related to exposure of sub- stances (such as asbestos fibers), may be detected on a chest x ray as fiberlike deposits, often in the lower por- tions of the lungs. Other Congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases may be indicated on the view of a heart and lung in a chest radiograph. Fractures of the sternum and ribs are usually easily detected as breaks on the chest x ray. In some instances, the radiologist\u2019s view of the diaphragm may indicate an abdominal problem. Tuberculosis can also be indicated by elevation of the diaphragm. Foreign bodies which may have been swallowed or inhaled can usually be located by the radiologist as they will look dif- ferent from any other tissue or structure in the chest. Ser- ial chest x rays may be ordered to track changes over a period of time. Resources ORGANIZATIONS American Lung Association. 1740 Broadway, New York, NY 10019.

Teresa Norris, RN Chickenpox Definition Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and extremely infectious childhood disease that also affects adults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash that typically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa- nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of chickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunity against the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken- pox are easily recognized and in most cases merely unpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost always be carried out at home. Severe complications can develop, however, and professional medical attention is essential in some circumstances. Description Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children born each year in the United States contracted chicken- pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000 cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari- cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family), which is spread through the air or by direct contact with an infected person. Once someone has been infected with the virus, an incubation period of about 10\u201321 days pass- es before symptoms begin. The period during which infected people are able to spread the disease is believed to start one or two days before the rash breaks out and to continue until all the blisters have formed scabs, which usually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 749 Chickenpox",

Chest x rays are used to see foreign bodies that may have been swallowed or inhaled, and to evaluate response to treatment for various diseases. Often the chest x ray is also used to verify correct placement of chest tubes or catheters. KEY TERMS Bronchi\u2014Plural of bronchus. The air passages in the lungs through which inhaled air passes on its way to the lungs. Diaphragm \u2014The large muscle that is located between the abdomen and the chest area. The diaphragm aids in breathing. Gastrointestinal\u2014The digestive organs and struc- tures, including the stomach and intestines. Interstitial lung disease \u2014About 180 diseases fall into this category of breathing disorders. Injury or foreign substances in the lungs, (such as asbestos fibers) as well as infections, cancers, or inherited disorders may cause the diseases. They can lead to breathing or heart failure. Lymphoid\u2014Tissues relating to the lymphatic sys- tem. A thin, yellowish fluid, called lymph fluid, travels throughout the body. The lymphatic system helps control fluids in the body. Portable chest x ray\u2014An x ray procedure taken by equipment that can be brought to the patient. The resulting radiographs may not be as high in quality as stationary x ray radiographs, but allow a tech- nologist to come to the bedridden patient. Pulmonary\u2014Refers to the lungs and the breathing system and function. Serial x rays\u2014A number of x rays performed at set times in the disease progression or treatment inter- vals. The radiographs will be compared to one another to track changes. Sternum\u2014Also referred to as the breast bone, this is the long flat bone in the middle of the chest. Thorax\u2014The chest area, which runs between the abdomen and neck and is encased in the ribs. X ray\u2014A form of electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays can penetrate most structures. Precautions Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or second trimester, should not have chest x rays unless absolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women who are, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a protec- tive lead apron. Because the procedure involves radia- tion, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure, particularly for children. However, the amount of radia- tion from one chest x ray procedure is minimal. Description Routine chest x rays consist of two views, the frontal view (referred to as posterioranterior or PA), and the lat- eral (side) view. It is preferred that the patient stand for this exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid in the lungs. During the actual time of exposure, the technologist will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is very important in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is no motion that could detract from the quality and sharpness of the film image. The procedure will only take a few minutes and the time patients must hold their breaths is a matter of a few seconds. The chest x ray may be performed in a physician\u2019s office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or hospital radiology department. In some cases, particular- ly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may be taken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality than those taken with permanent equipment, but are the best choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden patients may be placed in as upright a position as possi- ble to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid. Preparation There is no advance preparation necessary for chest x rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam area, a hospi- tal gown will replace all clothing on the upper body and all jewelry must be removed. Aftercare No aftercare is required by patients who have chest x rays. Risks The only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal exposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant women and children. Those patients should use protective lead aprons during the procedure.

Following the procedure, films of the images are usually printed for the radiologist and referring physician to review. A radiologist can also interpret CT exams on a special computer screen. The procedure time will vary in length depending on the area being imaged. Average study times are from 30 to 60 minutes.

The CT image While traditional x rays image organs in two dimen- sions, with the possibility that organs in the front of the body are superimposed over those in the back, CT scans allow for a more three-dimensional effect. Some have compared CT images to slices in a loaf of bread. Precise sections of the body can be located and imaged as cross- sectional views. The screen before the technologist shows a computer\u2019s analysis of each section detected by the x-ray beam. Thus, various densities of tissue can be easily distinguished. Contrast agents Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and in other radiology procedures to illuminate certain details of anatomy which may not be easily seen. Some con- trasts are natural, such as air or water. Other times, a water-based contrast agent is administered for specific diagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate is commonly used in gastroenterology procedures. The patient may drink this contrast, or receive it in an enema. Oral and rectal con- trast are usually given when examining the abdomen or cells, and not given when scanning the brain or chest. Iodine is the most widely used intravenous contrast agent and is given through an intravenous needle. If contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these will be administered several minutes before the study begins. Abdominal CT patients may be asked to drink a contrast medium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flush- ing of the face, warmth or slight nausea, or hives from an intravenous contrast injection. Technologists and radiolo- gists have equipment and training to help patients through these minor reactions and to handle more severe reactions. Severe reactions to contrast are rare, but do occur. Spiral CT Spiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer version of CT scanning which is continuous in motion and allows for three-dimensional recreation of images. For example, traditional CT allows the technologist to take slices at very small and precise intervals one after the other. Spiral CT allows for a continuous flow of images, without stopping the scanner to move to the next image slice. A major advantage of spiral CT is the ability to reconstruct images anywhere along the length of the study area. The procedure also speeds up the imaging process, meaning less time for the patient to lie still. The ability to image contrast more rapidly after it is injected, when it is at its highest level, is another advantage of spi- ral CT\u2019s high speed. Some facilities will have both spiral and convention- al CT available. Although spiral is more advantageous for many applications, conventional CT is still a superior and precise method for imaging many tissues and struc- tures. The physician will evaluate which type of CT works best for the specific exam purpose. Preparation If a contrast medium is administered, the patient may be asked to fast from about four to six hours prior to the procedure. Patients will usually be given a gown (like a typical hospital gown) to be worn during the procedure. All metal and jewelry should be removed to avoid arti- facts on the film. Aftercare No aftercare is generally required following a CT scan. Immediately following the exam, the technologist will continue to watch the patient for possible adverse contrast reactions.

Description A concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit by an object, or when the brain is jarred against the skull, with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of function in the higher centers of the brain. The injured person may remain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and is disoriented for some minutes after the blow. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 300,000 people sustain mild to moderate sports-related brain injuries each year, most of them young men between 16 and 25. While concussion usually resolves on its own with- out lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much more serious condition. \u201cSecond impact syndrome\u201d occurs when a person with a concussion, even a very mild one, suffers a second blow before fully recovering from the first. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pres- sure that can result is potentially fatal. More than 20 such cases have been reported since the syndrome was first described in 1984. Causes and symptoms Causes Most concussions are caused by motor vehicle acci- dents and sports injuries . In motor vehicle accidents, concussion can occur without an actual blow to the head. Instead, concussion occurs because the skull suddenly decelerates or stops, which causes the brain to be jarred against the skull.

Toni Rizzo Chest drainage therapy Definition Chest drainage therapy involves the removal of air, blood, pus, or other secretions from the chest cavity. Purpose Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection. Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer- gency or a planned procedure. Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity is also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some- times called thoracostomy tube drainage. Conditions that may need to be treated by chest drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues of the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu- mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions include cancer that causes excessive secretions, empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax (blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage therapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavity after lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung is collapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapy allows the lung to reinflate. Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 743 Chest drainage therapy",

For arterial emboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography are ordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray, lung scan, pulmonary angiography , electrocardiography , arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or venous ultrasound could be ordered. Diagnosing an arterial embolism Ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer then presses it against the patient\u2019s body. The ultrasound\u2019s sound waves arteries are converted into an image that can be displayed on a moni- tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30\u201360 minutes. An arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi- um is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. It can be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or diagnostic center of a hospital. Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism A chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect other respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan shows poor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. The patient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceutical and pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with a gamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical is injected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned. A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonary embolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital or an outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes. Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used often because it is expensive, invasive, and not readily available in most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographic test which involves injection of a radio contrast agent to show the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera records the blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul- monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital\u2019s radiology medicine department and takes 30\u201360 minutes. An electrocardiograph shows the heart\u2019s electrical activity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolism from a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient\u2019s chest, arms, and legs. Impulses of the heart\u2019s activity are traced on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes. Arterial blood gas measurements are sometimes helpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonary embolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of a vein, usually in the wrist. Venography is used to look for the most likely source of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis. It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it is painful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high dose of radiation, and can cause complications.

Women who have a history of these other types of cancer are at an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. \u2022 Low parity or nulliparity. Endometrial cancer is more common in women who have born few (low parity) or no (nulliparity) children. The high levels of proges- terone produced during pregnancy has a protective effect against endometrial cancer. The results of one study suggest that nulliparity is associated with a lower survival rate. \u2022 Infertility. Risk is increased due to nulliparity or the use of fertility drugs. \u2022 Polycystic ovary syndrome. The increased level of estrogen associated with this abnormality raises the risk of cancers of the breast and endometrium. The most common symptom of endometrial cancer is unusual vaginal spotting, bleeding, or discharge. In women who are near menopause (perimenopausal), symptoms of endometrial cancer could include bleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding), heavy bleed- ing that lasts for more than seven days, or short menstru- al cycles (fewer than 21 days). For women who have gone through menopause, any vaginal bleeding or abnor- mal discharge is suspect. Pain in the pelvic region and the presence of a lump (mass) are symptoms that occur late in the disease. Diagnosis If endometrial cancer is suspected, a series of tests will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. The first step will involve taking a complete personal and family medical history. A physical examination , which will include a thorough pelvic examination, will also be done. The doctor may order an endometrial biopsy . This is generally performed in the doctor\u2019s office and does not require anesthesia. A thin, flexible tube is inserted through the cervix and into the uterus. A small piece of endometrial tissue is removed. The patient may experi- ence some discomfort, which can be minimized by tak- ing an anti-inflammatory medication (like Advil or Motrin) an hour before the procedure. If an adequate amount of tissue was not obtained by the endometrial biopsy, or if the biopsy tissue looks abnormal but confirmation is needed, the doctor may per- form a dilatation and curettage(D & C).

          "content": "Endometrial cancer Definition Endometrial cancer develops when the cells that make up the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium) become abnormal and grow uncontrollably. Description Endometrial cancer (also called uterine cancer) is the fourth most common type of cancer among women and the most common gynecologic cancer. Approximate- ly 34,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer each year. In 1998, approximately 6,300 women died from this cancer. Although endometrial cancer generally occurs in women who have gone through menopause and are 45 years of age or older, 30% of the women with endometrial cancer are younger than 40 years of age. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years old. The uterus, or womb, is the hollow female organ that supports the development of the unborn baby during pregnancy. The uterus has a thick muscular wall and an inner lining called the endometrium. The endometrium is very sensitive to hormones and it changes daily during the menstrual cycle. The endometrium is designed to provide an ideal environment for the fertilized egg to implant and begin to grow. If pregnancy does not occur, the endometrium is shed causing the menstrual period. More than 95% of uterine cancers arise in the endometrium. The most common type of uterine cancer is adenocarcinoma. It arises from an abnormal multipli- cation of endometrial cells (atypical adenomatous hyper- plasia) and is made up of mature, specialized cells (well- differentiated). Less commonly, endometrial cancer aris- es without a preceding hyperplasia and is made up of poorly differentiated cells. The more common of these types are the papillary serous and clear cell carcinomas. Poorly differentiated endometrial cancers are often asso- ciated with a less promising prognosis. The highest incidence of endometrial cancer in the United States is in Caucasians, Hawaiians, Japanese, and African Americans. American Indians, Koreans, and Vietnamese have the lowest incidence. African American and Hawaiian women are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and, therefore, have a higher risk of dying from the disease. Causes and symptoms Although the exact cause of endometrial cancer is unknown, it is clear that high levels of estrogen, when not balanced by progesterone, can lead to abnormal growth of the endometrium. Factors that increase a woman\u2019s risk of developing endometrial cancer are: \u2022 Age. The risk is considerably higher in women who are over the age of 50 and have gone through menopause. \u2022 Obesity. Being overweight is a very strong risk factor for this cancer. Fatty tissue can change other normal body chemicals into estrogen, which can promote endometrial cancer. \u2022 Estrogen replacement therapy. Women receiving estro- gen supplements after menopause have a 12 times high- er risk of getting endometrial cancer if progesterone is not taken simultaneously. \u2022 Diabetes. Diabetics have twice the risk of getting this cancer as nondiabetic women. It is not clear if this risk is due to the fact that many diabetics are also obese and hypertensive. One 1998 study found that women who were obese and diabetic were three times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women who were obese but nondiabetic. This study also found that nonobese diabetics were not at risk of developing endometrial cancer. \u2022 Hypertension . High blood pressure (or hypertension) is also considered a risk factor for uterine cancer. \u2022 Irregular menstrual periods. During the menstrual cycle, there is interaction between the hormones estro- gen and progesterone. Women who do not ovulate regu- larly are exposed to high estrogen levels for longer peri- ods of time. If a woman does not ovulate regularly, this delicate balance is upset and may increase her chances of getting uterine cancer. \u2022 Early first menstruation or late menopause. Having the first period at a young age (the mean age of menses is 12.16 years in African American girls and 12.88 years in caucasian girls) or going through menopause at a late age (over age 51) seem to put women at a slightly higher risk for developing endometrial cancer. \u2022 Tamoxifen. This drug, which is used to treat or prevent breast cancer, increases a woman\u2019s chance of develop- ing endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen users tend to have more advanced endometrial cancer with an associated poorer survival rate than those who do not take the drug. In many cases, however, the value of tamoxifen for treating breast cancer and for preventing the cancer from spreading far outweighs the small risk of getting endometrial cancer. \u2022 Family history. Some studies suggest that endometrial cancer runs in certain families. Women with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at a higher risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other gynecologic cancers.

Choriocarcinomas that spread to other organs may reveal their presence by bleeding. In the brain, this bleeding can cause a stroke. Diagnosis Choriocarcinomas are usually referred to an oncologist, a doctor who specializes in cancer treat- ment. To diagnose this tumor, the doctor will do a physical examination and examine the internal organs with x rays or ultrasound studies. Choriocarci- nomas are not always biopsied before being treated, because they tend to bleed heavily. Spreading of the cancer is detected with x rays, ultrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Most choriocarcinomas make human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone normally found only during pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the blood can help diagnose this cancer and monitor the success of treatment. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 797 Choriocarcinoma",

          "content": "Risks The risks of an endometrial biopsy are very small. There is a possibility that prolonged bleeding may occur after the procedure. There is also a slight chance of an infection. Very rarely, there are instances when the uterus is pierced (perforated) or the cervix is torn because of the biopsy. Normal results Most biopsies are done to rule out endometrial cancer or endometrial hyperplasia. A normal result shows no can- cerous or precancerous cells. Normal results also show that the uterine lining is changing at the proper rate. If it is, then the results of the biopsy are said to be \u201cin-phase\u201d because the tissue looks appropriate and has developed normally for the late phase of the menstrual cycle. Abnormal results If the endometrium is not developing at the appro- priate rate, the results are said to be \u201cout-of-phase\u201d or abnormal. The endometrium has not developed appropri- ately and cannot support a pregnancy. This condition is called luteal phase defect and may need to be treated with progesterone. Abnormal appearance of the cells forming the uter- ine tissue could also indicate uterine cancer, or the pres- ence of fibroids or polyps in the uterus.

          "content": "Endometrial biopsy Definition Endometrial biopsy is a procedure in which a sam- ple of the endometrium (tissue lining the inside of the uterus) is removed for microscopic examination. Purpose The test is most often performed to find out the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. Abnormal bleeding includes bleeding between menstrual periods, excessive bleeding during a menstrual period, or bleeding after menopause . Since abnormal uterine bleeding can indi- cate cancer, an endometrial biopsy is done to rule out endometrial cancer or hyperplasia (a potentially pre- cancerous condition). Endometrial biopsies are also done as a screening test for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy . Hormone replacement therapy usually requires a woman to take estrogen and progesterone. An endometrial biopsy is particularly use- ful in cases where postmenopausal women take estrogen, but cannot take progesterone. Estrogen in the system without the balancing effect of progesterone has been linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer. An endometrial biopsy can also be used as part of an infertility exam to rule out problems with the develop- ment of the endometrium. This condition is called luteal phase defect and can cause the endometrium to not sup- port a pregnancy. An endometrial biopsy can also be used to evaluate the problem of repeated early miscarriages. Precautions If the endometrial biopsy is being done to investigate why a woman is unable to get pregnant, the test must be performed at a specific time during the menstrual cycle. Since the test evaluates whether the endometrium is developed adequately to support implantation and growth of a fertilized egg, it is critical to perform the test approxi- mately three days before the expected menstrual period. Description The test is performed by a doctor who specializes in women\u2019s reproductive health (an obstetrician/gynecolo- gist). The test is performed either in the doctor\u2019s office or in a local hospital. The patient may be asked to take pain medication (like Motrin or Aleve) an hour or so before the procedure. A local anesthetic may be injected into the cervix in order to decrease pain and discomfort during the procedure. The woman will be asked to lie on her back with knees apart and feet in stirrups. The doctor will first con- duct a thorough exam of the pelvic region, including the vulva (the external genitals), vagina, and uterus. A specu- lum (an instrument that is used to hold the walls of the vagina open) will be inserted into the vagina. A small, hollow plastic tube is then passed into the uterine cavity. A small piece of the uterine lining is sucked out with a plunger that is attached to the tube. Once the sample is obtained, the instruments are removed. The sample is sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination. The patient may experience some pain when the cervix is grasped. The patient may also feel some cramp- ing, pressure, and discomfort when the instruments are inserted into the uterus and the tissue sample is collected. Preparation For the small number of endometrial biopsies that are done as part of infertility testing, a pregnancy test is also often performed before the procedure. Since the biopsy is performed late in the menstrual cycle, it is pos- sible that the woman may be pregnant. Aftercare The biopsy may cause a small amount of bleeding (spotting). The woman can resume normal activities right away. If cramping becomes severe, heavy bleeding occurs, or the woman develops a high temperature, the doctor should be notified immediately. If the test is being done to determine the cause of infertility, the onset of the menstrual period following the biopsy should be reported to the doctor. This will allow the doctor to correctly predict if the endometrium has been developing at the expected rate.

The tissue that is obtained from the biopsy or the D & C is sent to a laboratory for examination. If cancer is found, then the type of cancer will be determined. The treatment and prognosis depends on the type and stage of the cancer. Trans-vaginal ultrasound may be used to measure the thickness of the endometrium. For this painless procedure, a wand-like ultrasound transducer is inserted into the vagi- na to enable visualization and measurement of the uterus, the thickness of the uterine lining, and other pelvic organs. Other possible diagnostic procedures include sono- hysterography and hysteroscopy. For sonohysteroscopy, a small tube is passed through the cervix and into the uterus. A small amount of a salt water (saline) solution is injected through the tube to open the space within the uterus and allow ultrasound visualization of the endometrium. For hysteroscopy, a wand-like camera is passed through the cervix to allow direct visualization of the endometrium. Both of these procedures cause dis- comfort, which may be reduced by taking an anti-inflam- matory medication prior to the procedure.

Endometrial cancer is categorized into four stages (I, II, III, and IV) that are subdivided (A, B, and possibly C) based on the depth or spread of cancerous tissue. Seventy percent of all uterine cancers are stage I, 10\u201315% are stage II, and the remainder are stages III and IV . The cancer is also graded (G1, G2, and G3) based upon microscopic analysis of the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The FIGO stages for endometrial cancer are: \u2022 Stage I. Cancer is limited to the uterus. \u2022 Stage II. Cancer involves the uterus and cervix. \u2022 Stage III. Cancer has spread out of the uterus but is restricted to the pelvic region. \u2022 Stage IV . Cancer has spread to the bladder, bowel, or other distant locations. The mainstay of treatment for most stages of endometrial cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy , hor- monal therapy, and chemotherapy are additional treat- ments (called adjuvant therapy). The necessity of adju- vant therapy is a controversial topic which should be dis- cussed with the patient\u2019s treatment team.

Lata Cherath Belinda Rowland, Ph.D. Endometriosis Definition Endometriosis is a condition in which bits of the tis- sue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grow in other parts of the body. Like the uterine lining, this tis- sue builds up and sheds in response to monthly hormonal cycles. However, there is no natural outlet for the blood discarded from these implants. Instead, it falls onto sur- rounding organs, causing swelling and inflammation. This repeated irritation leads to the development of scar tissue and adhesions in the area of the endometrial implants. Description Endometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women of childbearing age in the United States. It most commonly strikes between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis can also appear in the teen years, but never before the start of menstruation. It is seldom seen in postmenopausal women. Endometriosis was once called the \u201ccareer woman\u2019s disease\u201d because it was thought to be a product of delayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrow generalization; however, pregnancy may slow the progress of the condition. A more important predictor of a woman\u2019s risk is if her female relatives have endome- triosis. Another influencing factor is the length of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle. Women whose periods last longer than a week with an interval of less than 27 days between them seem to be more prone to the condition. Endometrial implants are most often found on the pelvic organs\u2014the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and in the cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally, this tissue grows in such distant parts of the body as the lungs, arms, and kidneys. Newly formed implants appear as small bumps on the surfaces of the organs and supporting liga- ments and are sometimes said to look like \u201cpowder burns.\u201d Ovarian cysts may form around endometrial tissue (endometriomas) and may range from pea to grapefruit size. Endometriosis is a progressive condition that usually advances slowly, over the course of many years. Doctors rank cases from minimal to severe based on factors such as the number and size of the endometrial implants, their appearance and location, and the extent of the scar tissue and adhesions in the vicinity of the growths. Causes and symptoms Although the exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, a number of theories have been put forward. Some of the more popular ones are: \u2022 Implantation theory. Originally proposed in the 1920s, this theory states that a reversal in the direction of men- strual flow sends discarded endometrial cells into the body cavity where they attach to internal organs and seed endometrial implants. There is considerable evi- dence to support this explanation. Reversed menstrual GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1192 Endometriosis",

The lymph nodes in the pelvic region may also be biopsied or removed to check for metastasis. Hysterectomy is traditionally per- formed through an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy), however, endoscopic surgery (laparoscopy) with vaginal hysterectomy is also being used. Women with stage I dis- ease may require no further treatment. However, those with higher grade disease will receive adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the stage of the disease. Radiation therapy may be used before surgery (preoperatively) and/or after surgery (postoperatively). Radiation given from a machine that is outside the body is called external radiation therapy. Sometimes applicators containing radioactive com- pounds are placed inside the vagina or uterus. This is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy and requires hospitalization. Side effects are common with radiation therapy. The skin in the treated area may become red and dry. Fatigue, upset stomach, diarrhea , and nausea are also common complaints. Radiation therapy in the pelvic area may cause the vagina to become narrow (vaginal steno- sis), making intercourse painful. Premature menopause and some problems with urination may also occur. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is usually reserved for women with stage IV or recurrent disease because this therapy is not a very effective treatment for endometrial cancer. The anticancer drugs are given by mouth or intravenously. Side effects include stomach upset, vomiting, appetite loss, hair loss, mouth or vaginal sores, fatigue, menstrual cycle changes, and premature menopause. There is also an increased chance of infections. Hormonal therapy Hormonal therapy uses drugs like progesterone to slow the growth of endometrial cells. These drugs are usually available as pills. This therapy is usually reserved for women with advanced or recurrent disease. Side effects include fatigue, fluid retention, and appetite and weight changes. Alternative treatment Although alternative and complementary therapies are used by many cancer patients, very few controlled studies on the effectiveness of such therapies exist. Mind-body techniques, such as prayer, biofeedback, visualization, meditation, and yoga, have not shown any effect in reduc- ing cancer, but they can reduce stress and lessen some of the side effects of cancer treatments. Clinical studies of hydrazine sulfate found that it had no effect on cancer and even worsened the health and well-being of the study sub- jects. One clinical study of the drug amygdalin (Laetrile) found that it had no effect on cancer. Laetrile can be toxic and has caused deaths. Shark cartilage, although highly touted as an effective cancer treatment, is an improbable therapy that has not been the subject of clinical study. The American Cancer Society has found that the \u201cmetabolic diets\u201d pose serious risk to the patient. The effectiveness of the macrobiotic, Gerson, and Kelley diets and the Manner metabolic therapy has not been scientifi- cally proven. The FDA was unable to substantiate the anti- cancer claims made about the popular Cancell treatment. There is no evidence for the effectiveness of most over-the-counter herbal cancer remedies. Some herbals have shown an anticancer effect. As shown in clinical studies, Polysaccharide krestin, from the mushroom Coriolus versicolor, has significant effectiveness against cancer. In a small study, the green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa has been shown to have anticancer activity. In a few small studies, evening primrose oil has shown some benefit in the treatment of cancer. Prognosis Because it is possible to detect endometrial cancer early, the chances of curing it are excellent. The five year survival rates for endometrial cancer by stage are: 90%, stage I; 60%, stage II; 40%, stage III; and 5%, stage IV . Endometrial cancer most often spreads to the lungs, liver, bones, brain, vagina, and certain lymph nodes. Prevention Women (especially postmenopausal women) should report any abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge to the doctor. Controlling obesity, blood pressure, and diabetes can help to reduce the risk of this disease. Women on estrogen replacement therapy have a substantially reduced risk of endometrial cancer if progestins are taken simultaneously. Long term use of birth control pills has been shown to reduce the risk of this cancer. Women who have irregular periods may be prescribed birth control pills to help prevent endometrial cancer. Women who are taking tamoxifen and those who carry the hereditary non- polyposis colorectal cancer gene should be screened reg- ularly, receiving annual pelvic examinations.

David Kaminstein, MD Echinococcus granulosus infection see Echinococcosis Echocardiography Definition Echocardiography is a diagnostic test that uses ultra- sound waves to create an image of the heart muscle. Ultrasound waves that rebound or echo off the heart can show the size, shape, and movement of the heart\u2019s valves and chambers as well as the flow of blood through the heart. Echocardiography may show such abnormalities as poorly functioning heart valves or damage to the heart tissue from a past heart attack. Purpose Echocardiography is used to diagnose certain cardio- vascular diseases. In fact, it is one of the most widely used diagnostic tests for heart disease. It can provide a wealth of helpful information, including the size and shape of the heart, its pumping strength, and the location and extent of any damage to its tissues. It is especially useful for assess- ing diseases of the heart valves. It not only allows doctors to evaluate the heart valves, but it can detect abnormalities in the pattern of blood flow, such as the backward flow of blood through partly closed heart valves, known as regur- gitation. By assessing the motion of the heart wall, echocardiography can help detect the presence and assess the severity of coronary artery disease , as well as help determine whether any chest pain is related to heart dis- ease. Echocardiography can also help detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which the walls of the heart thicken in an attempt to compensate for heart muscle weakness. The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is noninvasive (doesn\u2019t involve breaking the skin or entering body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects. Precautions Echocardiography is an extremely safe procedure and no special precautions are required. Description Echocardiography creates an image of the heart using ultra-high-frequency sound waves\u2014sound waves that are too high in frequency to be heard by the human ear. The technique is very similar to ultrasound scanning commonly used to visualize the fetus during pregnancy. An echocardiography examination generally lasts between 15\u201330 minutes. The patient lies bare-chested on an examination table. A special gel is spread over the chest to help the transducer make good contact and slide smoothly over the skin. The transducer, a small hand-held device at the end of a flexible cable, is placed against the chest. Essentially a modified microphone, the transducer directs ultrasound waves into the chest. Some of the waves get echoed (or reflected) back to the transducer. Since different tissues and blood all reflect ultrasound waves differently, these sound waves can be translated into a meaningful image of the heart, which can be dis- played on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. The patient does not feel the sound waves, and the entire pro- cedure is painless. In fact, there are no known side effects. Occasionally, variations of the echocardiography test are used. For example, Doppler echocardiography employs a special microphone that allows technicians to measure and analyze the direction and speed of blood flow through blood vessels and heart valves. This makes it especially useful for detecting and evaluating regurgi- tation through the heart valves. By assessing the speed of blood flow at different locations around an obstruction, it can also help to precisely locate the obstruction. An exercise echocardiogram is an echocardiogram performed during exercise, when the heart muscle must work harder to supply blood to the body. This allows doctors to detect heart problems that might not be evi- dent when the body is at rest and needs less blood.

The word ectopic means \u201cin an abnormal place or position.\u201d The most common site is the fallopian tube, the tube that nor- mally carries eggs from the ovary to the uterus. However, ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the ovary, the abdomen, and the cervical canal (the opening from the uterus to the vaginal canal). The phrases tubal pregnancy, ovarian preg- nancy, cervical pregnancy, and abdominal pregnancy refer to the specific area of an ectopic pregnancy. Description Once a month, an egg is produced in a woman\u2019s ovary and travels down the fallopian tube where it meets the male\u2019s sperm and is fertilized. In a normal pregnancy the fertilized egg, or zygote, continues on its passage down the fallopian tube and enters the uterus in three to five days. The zygote continues to grow, implanting itself securely in the wall of the uterus.

Purpose Doppler ultrasonography can detect the direction, velocity, and turbulence of blood flow. It is frequently used to detect problems with heart valves or to measure blood flow through the arteries. Specifically, it is useful in the work up of stroke patients, in assessing blood flow in the abdomen or legs, and in viewing the heart to moni- tor carotid artery diseases. Precautions The test is widely used because it is noninvasive, uses no x rays, and gives excellent images. It is harmless, painless, and widely available. Description Doppler ultrasonography makes use of two different principles. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high- frequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it will be reflected by its target and the reflected sound can be detected back at its origin. In addition, it is known that certain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce an electrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound. The Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch increases as the source moves toward the listener and decreases as it moves away. Medical science utilizes these two principles in the following way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe) containing piezoelectric crystals sends a series of short sound pulses into the body and pauses between each pulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machine then determines the direction and depth of each returning sound and coverts this into a point of light on a television monitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed and displayed every second to produce an image of the organ being studied. The image allows the doctor to see the organ functioning in real time. The newest addition to this test is the addition of color. Adding color to the image shows the direction and rate of blood flow more clearly. During a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the technician will apply a gel to the skin, then place the transducer against the skin at various angles. The trans- ducer sends the information it receives to a television monitor that shows a moving image of the organ being studied. The technician can save these images either on video tape, paper, or x-ray film for further study. Preparation There is no special preparation needed for this test. The ultrasound technician may apply a clear gel to the skin in order to help the transducer more freely over the body. Aftercare No aftercare is necessary. Normal results A Doppler ultrasonography test showing no restrict- ed blood flow, is a normal finding.

          "content": "are evaluated, in addition to measuring pressures of and collecting blood samples from the right atrium, ventricle, and pulmonary artery. Left-sided heart catheterization is performed by way of a catheter through an artery which tests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function of the mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle. Purpose The primary reason for conducting a cardiac catheterization is to diagnose and manage persons known or suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con- dition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually in the United States. Symptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform- ing this procedure include: \u2022 chest pain, characterized by prolonged heavy pressure or a squeezing pain \u2022 abnormal treadmill stress test \u2022 myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack \u2022 congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi- nated from birth \u2022 a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease \u2022 a need to measure the heart muscle\u2019s ability to pump blood Typically performed along with angiography, a tech- nique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outline the heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the visualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalities in the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi- ologist may assess the patient\u2019s need and readiness for coronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasive approach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either surgically or with the use of a balloon (angioplasty). When looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro- scopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to be assessed: \u2022 enlargement of the left ventricle \u2022 ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood vessel) \u2022 narrowing of the aortic valve \u2022 insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve \u2022 the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the other due to septal defects (also known as shunting) Precautions Cardiac catheterization is categorized as an \u201cinva- sive\u201d procedure which involves the heart, its valves, and coronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm or leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important to evaluate for the following conditions before considering this procedure: \u2022 A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func- tion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi- tions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro- cedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure. \u2022 A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected, antibiotics may be given before the test to prevent inflammation of the membrane which lines the heart (endocarditis). Description To understand how a cardiac catheterization is able to diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work- ings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just as the body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in its everyday functions, so does the heart. The heart is made up of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter- ies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy- gen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality in any of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart\u2019s function. These abnormalities cause the heart\u2019s blood flow to decrease and result in the condition known as coronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency. Catheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and treating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of fluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may resemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the veins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can monitor a body\u2019s various functions at each moment. Generally a test that lasts two to three hours, a patient should expect the following prior to and during the catheterization procedure: \u2022 A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient to relax but remain conscious during the test. \u2022 An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to administer medication. Electrodes will be attached to the chest to enable the painless procedure known as an electrocardiograph. \u2022 Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by injecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is injected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quick stinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced as the catheter travels through the blood vessel. \u2022 After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery system, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is injected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 656 Cardiac catheterization",

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrocardiography Definition Electrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva- sive procedure for recording electrical changes in the heart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate to the electrical impulses which occur during each beat of the heart. The results are printed on paper or displayed on a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P, Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num- ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present. Purpose Electrocardiography is a starting point for detecting many cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physical examinations and for monitoring the patient\u2019s condition during and after surgery, as well as during intensive care. It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Precautions No special precautions are required. Description The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec- trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif- ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the electrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be employed. Muscle movement may interfere with the recording, which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases where rhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, the patient may wear a small Holter monitor in order to record continuously over a 24-hour period; this is known as ambulatory monitoring. Preparation The skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact at the electrode positions. Aftercare To avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to obtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor- oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes. Risks No complications from this procedure have been observed. Normal results When the heart is operating normally, each part con- tracts in a specific order.

If emboli become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, they may cause coughing or shortness of breath . Emboli lodged in the brain may cause symp- toms of a mini-stroke, such as numbness, weakness, or paralysis on one side of the body or sudden vision loss or double vision. Emboli may also damage the kidneys, causing blood to appear in the urine. Sometimes the cap- illaries on the surface of the spleen rupture, causing the spleen to become enlarged and tender to the touch. Any- one experiencing any of these symptoms should seek medical help immediately. Diagnosis Doctors begin the diagnosis by taking a history, ask- ing the patient about the symptoms mentioned above. During a physical examination , the doctor may also uncover signs such as fever, an enlarged spleen, signs of kidney disease, or hemorrhaging. Listening to the patient\u2019s chest with a stethoscope, the doctor may also hear a heart murmur. A heart murmur may indicate abnormal flow of blood through one of the heart cham- bers or valves. Doctors take a sample of the patient\u2019s blood to test it for bacteria and other microorganisms that may be caus- ing the infection. They usually also use a test called echocardiography , which uses ultrasound waves to make images of the heart, to check for abnormalities in the structure of the heart wall or valves. One of the tell- tale signs they look for in echocardiography is vegeta- tion, the abnormal growth of tissue around a valve com- posed of blood platelets, bacteria, and a clotting protein called fibrin. Another tell-tale sign is regurgitation, or the backward flow of blood, through one of the heart valves. A normal echocardiogram does not exclude the possibili- ty of endocarditis, but an abnormal echocardiogram can confirm its presence. If an echocardiogram cannot be done or its results are inconclusive, a modified technique called transesophageal echocardiography is some- times performed. Transesophageal echocardiography involves passing an ultrasound device into the esophagus to get a clearer image of the heart. Treatment When doctors suspect infective endocarditis, they will admit the patient to a hospital and begin treating the infection before they even have the results of the blood culture. Their choice of antibiotics depends on what the most likely infecting microorganism is. Once the results of the blood culture become available, the doctor can adjust the medications, using specific antibiotics known to be effective against the specific microorganism involved. Unfortunately, in recent years, the treatment of endocarditis has become more complicated as a result of antibiotic resistance. Over the past few years, especially as antibiotics have been overprescribed, more and more strains of bacteria have become increasingly resistant to a wider range of antibiotics. For this reason, doctors may need to try a few different types of antibiotics\u2014or even a combination of antibiotics\u2014to successfully treat the infection. Antibiotics are usually given for about one month, but may need to be given for an even longer peri- od of time if the infection is resistant to treatment. Once the fever and the worst of the symptoms have gone away, the patient may be able to continue antibiotic therapy at home. During this time, the patient should make regular visits to the health care team for further testing and physical examination to make sure that the antibiotic therapy is working, that it is not causing adverse side effects, and that there are no complications such as emboli or heart failure. The patient should alert the health-care team to any symptoms that could indicate serious complications: For instance, trouble breathing or swelling in the legs could indicate congestive heart fail- ure. Headache, joint pain, blood in the urine, or stroke symptoms could indicate an embolus, and fever and chills could indicate that the treatment is not working and the infection is worsening. Finally, diarrhea, rash, itch- ing, or joint pain may suggest a bad reaction to the antibiotics. Anyone experiencing any of these symptoms should alert the health care team immediately. In some cases, surgery may be needed.

          "content": "Description Chancroid is an infection of the genitals that is caused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi . Chan- croid is a sexually transmitted disease, which means that it is spread from person to person almost always by sexu- al contact. However, there have been a few cases in which healthcare providers have become infected through contact with infected patients. Common locations for chancroid sores (ulcers) in men are the shaft or head of the penis, foreskin, the groove behind the head of the penis, the opening of the penis, and the scrotum. In women, common locations are the labia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips), perianal area (area around the anal opening), and inner thighs. It is rare for the ulcer(s) to be on the vaginal walls or cervix. In about 50% of the patients with chancroid, the infection spreads to either or both of the lymph nodes in the groin. Chancroid is most commonly found in developing and third world countries. In the United States, the most common cause of genital ulcers is genital herpes , fol- lowed by syphilis, and then chancroid. As of 1997, there were fewer than 1,500 cases of chancroid in the United States per year and it occurred primarily in African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. There are occasional localized outbreaks of chancroid in the United States. In addition, the practice of exchanging sex for drugs has lead to a link between crack cocaine use and chancroid. Even though the incidence of chancroid in the United States decreased in the 1990s, there is an alarming con- nection between chancroid and human immunodeficien- cy virus (HIV) infection. HIV causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and is easily spread from person to person through chancroid ulcers. Uncircum- cised men with chancroid ulcers have a 48% risk of acquiring HIV from sexual contact. Women with chan- croid ulcers are also at a greater risk of being infected with HIV during sexual contact. Genital ulcers seem to act as doorways for HIV to enter and exit. Causes and symptoms Haemophilus ducreyi is spread from person to per- son by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Uncircum- cised men are about three times more likely than circum- cised men to become infected following exposure to Haemophilus ducreyi. Having unprotected sex, exchang- ing sex for drugs, and having unprotected sex with a prostitute are other risk factors. Many cases of chancroid in the United States occur in persons who had traveled to countries where the disease is more common. Chancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi pene- trates the skin through an injury, like a scratch or cut. Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The first sign of chancroid is a small, red papule that occurs within three to seven days following exposure to the bacteria, but may take up to one month. Usually within one day, the papule becomes an ulcer. The chancroid ulcer is painful, bleeds easily, drains a grey or yellowish pus, and has sharply defined, ragged edges. They can vary in size from an eighth of an inch to two inches in diameter. Men usually have only one ulcer, but women often have four or more. Sometimes \u201ckissing\u201d ulcers occur when one ulcer spreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin sur- face. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips of the labia majora. Alternatively, women may not have any external sores but may experience painful urination, intercourse, and/or bowel movements and may have a vaginal discharge or rectal bleeding. Signs that the infection has spread to the lymph node appear about one week after the formation of the genital ulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the lymphatic system that filter waste materials from nearly every organ in the body. This lymph node infection is called \u201clymphadenitis\u201d and the swollen, painful lymph node is called a \u201cbubo.\u201d The bubo, which appears as a red, spher- ical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thick pus and forming another ulcer. Diagnosis Chancroid may be diagnosed and treated by urolo- gists (urinary tract doctors for men), gynecologists (for women), and infectious disease specialists. Part of the diagnosis of chancroid involves ruling out genital herpes and syphilis because genital ulcers are also symptoms of these diseases.

          "content": "can be close enough to be confusing. However, the pres- ence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with a genital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid. For a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus ducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster- ile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus sample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special media and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi takes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In addition, the pus may be examined under the microscope to see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pus may also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. A blood sample will probably be taken from the patient\u2019s arm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria that causes syphilis. Treatment The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given either once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouth for one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin), co-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin (Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone (Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or ofloxacin (Floxin). The ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce the swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to the ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre- vent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskin may require circumcision . Pus would be removed from infected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe. Very large buboes may require surgical drainage. Prognosis Without treatment, chancroid may either go away quickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers for many months. A complete cure is obtained with antibiotic treatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars. Severe scarring of the foreskin may require circumcision. Urethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urine tube to the skin) may occur and requires corrective surgery. KEY TERMS Bubo\u2014A tender, swollen lymph node in the groin that may follow a chancroid ulcer. Groin\u2014The region of the body that lies between the abdomen and the thighs. Prevention The best prevention for chancroid is to use a con- dom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be prevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con- tact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with a disease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid, it is important that all sexual contacts of the patient are identified and treated.

          "content": "Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with swallowing and chest pain. Because the esophagus does not empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs caus- ing cough, bronchitis , and repeated bouts of pneumo- nia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition become a significant factor in affecting survival. Involvement of the large intestine (colon) causes constipation, distention, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis The best way to diagnose acute infection is to identi- fy the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally it is pos- sible to culture the organism from infected tissue, but this process usually requires too much time to be of value. In the chronic phase, antibody levels can be measured. Efforts to develop new, more accurate tests are ongoing. Treatment In most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is possible. Present medications can reduce the duration and severity of an acute infection, but are only 50% effective, at best, in eliminating the organisms. Cardiac effects are managed with pacemakers and medications. Esophageal complications require either endoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophageal emptying, similar to those used to treat the disorder known as achalasia . Constipation is treated by increas- ing fiber and bulk laxatives, or removal of diseased por- tions of the colon. KEY TERMS Achalasia \u2014An esophageal disease of unknown cause, in which the lower sphincter or muscle is unable to relax normally, and leads to the accu- mulation of material within the esophagus. Endoscopy \u2014Exam using an endoscope (a thin flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature cam- era to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract). When the procedure is performed to exam- ine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pan- creas, the organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirectly through the injection of x ray. Parasite\u2014An organism that lives on or in another and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that organism. Regurgitation \u2014Flow of material back up the esophagus and into the throat or lungs. Prognosis Those patients with gastrointestinal complications often respond to some form of treatment. Cardiac prob- lems are more difficult to treat, particularly since trans- plant would rekindle infection. Prevention Visitors traveling to areas of known infection should avoid staying in mud, adobe, or similar huts. Mosquito nets and insect repellents are useful in helping to avoid contact with the bugs. Blood screening is not always effective in many regions where infection is common. It is necessary to carefully screen people who have emi- grated from Central and South America before they make blood donations.

          "content": "reveals hydrops fetalis. If the baby is in danger, and the pregnancy is at least 32\u201334 weeks along, labor is induced. Under 32 weeks, the baby is given blood trans- fusions while still in the mother\u2019s uterus. There are two techniques that are used to deliver a blood transfusion to a baby before birth. In the first, a needle is inserted through the mother\u2019s abdomen and uterus, and into the baby\u2019s abdomen. Red blood cells injected into the baby\u2019s abdominal cavity are absorbed into its bloodstream. In early pregnancy or if the baby\u2019s bilirubin levels are gravely high, cordocentesis is per- formed. This procedure involves sliding a very fine nee- dle through the mother\u2019s abdomen and, guided by ultra- sound, into a vein in the umbilical cord to inject red blood cells directly into the baby\u2019s bloodstream. After birth, the severity of the baby\u2019s symptoms are assessed. One or more transfusions may be necessary to treat anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and bleeding. Hyper- bilirubinemia is also treated with phototherapy, a treat- ment in which the baby is placed under a special light. This light causes changes in how the bilirubin molecule is shaped, which makes it easier to excrete. The baby may also receive oxygen and intravenous fluids contain- ing electrolytes or drugs to treat other symptoms. Prognosis In many cases of blood type incompatibility, the symptoms of erythroblastosis fetalis are prevented with careful monitoring and blood type screening. Treatment of minor symptoms is typically successful and the baby will not suffer long-term problems. Nevertheless, erythroblastosis is a very serious con- dition for approximately 4,000 babies annually. In about 15% of cases, the baby is severely affected and dies before birth. Babies who survive pregnancy may develop kernicterus, which can lead to deafness, speech prob- lems, cerebral palsy, or mental retardation . Extended hydrops fetalis can inhibit lung growth and contribute to heart failure . These serious complications are life threatening, but with good medical treatment, the fatality rate is very low. According to the U.S. Centers for Dis- ease Control and Prevention, there were 21 infant deaths in the United States during 1996 that were attributable to hemolytic disease (erythroblastosis fetalis) and jaundice. Prevention With any pregnancy, whether it results in a live birth, miscarriage , stillbirth , or abortion, blood typing is a universal precaution against blood compatibility disease. Blood types cannot be changed, but adequate forewarn- ing allows precautions and treatments that limit the dan- ger to unborn babies. If an Rh-negative woman gives birth to an Rh-posi- tive baby, she is given an injection of immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody protein, within 72 hours of the birth. The immunoglobulin destroys any fetal blood cells in her bloodstream before her immune system can react to them. In cases where this precaution is not taken, anti- bodies are created and future pregnancies may be com- plicated.

Julia Barrett Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Definition The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or sedi- mentation rate (sed rate), is a measure of the settling of red blood cells in a tube of blood during one hour. The rate is an indication of inflammation and increases in many diseases. Purpose ESR is increased in rheumatoid diseases, most infec- tions, and in cancer. An advanced rate doesn\u2019t diagnose a specific disease, but it does indicate that an underlying disease may be present. A physician can use ESR to monitor a person with an associated disease. When the disease worsens, the ESR increases; when the disease improves, the ESR decreases. The ESR doesn\u2019t always follow the course of cancer. ESR is called an acute-phase reactant test, meaning that it reacts to acute conditions in the body, such as infection or trauma. The rate increase follows a rise in temperature and white blood cells count, peaks after sev- eral days, and usually lasts longer than the elevated tem- perature or white blood cells count.

          "content": "Description According to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a worldwide organization devoted to safe-diving research and promotion, less than 1% of divers fall victim to DCS or the rarer bubble problem called gas embolism , air embolism, or arterial gas embolism (AGE). A study of the United States military community in Okinawa, where tens of thousands of sport and military dives are made each year, identified 84 DCS and 10 AGE cases in 1989\u201395, including nine deaths. This translated into estimates of one case in every 7,400 dives and one death in every 76,900 dives. DCS symptoms can be quite mild, however, and many cases certainly go unnoticed by divers. At times the terminology adopted by writers on DCS can be confusing. Some substitute the term decompression illness (DCI) for DCS. Others treat DCI as a label encompassing both DCS and AGE. An older term for DCS is caisson disease, coined in the nine- teenth century when it was discovered that bridge con- struction crews working at the bottom of lakes and rivers in large pressurized enclosures (caissons) were experiencing joint pain (a typical DCS symptom) on returning to the surface. Causes and symptoms The air we breathe is mostly a mixture of two gases, nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Unlike oxygen, nitro- gen is a biologically inert gas, meaning that it is not metabolized (converted into other substances) by the body. For this reason, most of the nitrogen we inhale is expelled when we exhale, but some is dissolved into the blood and other tissues. During a dive, however, the lungs take in more nitrogen than usual. This happens because the surrounding water pressure is greater than the air pressure at sea level (twice as great at 33 ft [10 m], for instance). As the water pressure increases, so does the pressure of the nitrogen in the compressed air inhaled by the diver. Because increased pressure causes an increase in gas density, the diver takes in more nitrogen with each breath than he or she would at sea level. Instead of being exhaled, however, the extra nitrogen safely dissolves into the tissues, where it remains until the diver begins his or her return to the surface (under some circumstances the extra nitrogen can cause nitrogen narcosis, but that con- dition is distinct from DCS). On the way up, decompres- sion occurs (in other words, the water pressure drops), and with the change in pressure, the extra nitrogen grad- ually diffuses out of the tissues and is delivered by the bloodstream to the lungs, which expel it from the body. If the diver surfaces too quickly, however, potentially dan- gerous nitrogen bubbles can form in the tissues and cause DCS. These bubbles can compress nerves, obstruct arter- ies, veins, and lymphatic vessels, and trigger harmful chemical reactions in the blood. The precise reasons for bubble formation remain unclear. How much extra nitrogen enters the tissues varies with the dive\u2019s depth and duration. Dive tables prepared by the U.S. Navy and other organizations specify how long most divers can safely remain at a particular depth. If the dive table limits are exceeded, the diver must pause on the way up to allow the nitrogen to diffuse into the bloodstream without forming bubbles; these pauses are called decompression stops, and are carefully calibrated. DCS can occur, however, even when a diver obeys safe diving rules. In such cases, the predisposing factors include fatigue , obesity , dehydration , hypothermia , and recent alcohol use. As well, people who fly or travel to high-altitude locations without letting 12\u201324 hours pass after their last dive are at risk for DCS as well because their bodies undergo further decompression. This is true even when flying in commercial aircraft. Many travelers are unaware that to save money on fuel the cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is set much lower than the pressure at sea level. At 30,000 ft (9,144 m), for instance, cabin pressure is usually equivalent to the pressure at 7,000\u20138,000 ft (2,133\u20132,438 m) above sea level, a safe setting for everyone but recent divers. Exact- ly how long a diver should wait before flying or traveling to a high-altitude location depends on how much diving he or she has done and other considerations. If there is uncertainty about the appropriate waiting period, the sen- sible course of action is to let the full 24 hours pass. Because the nitrogen bubbles that cause DCS can affect any of the body\u2019s tissues, including the blood, bones, nerves, and muscles, many kinds of symptoms are possible. Symptoms can appear minutes after a diver sur- faces, and in about 80% of cases do so within eight hours. Pain is often the only symptom; this is sometimes called the bends, although many people incorrectly use that term as a synonym for DCS itself. The pain, which ranges from mild to severe, is usually limited to the joints, but can be felt anywhere. Severe itching (pruritis), skin rashes, and skin mottling (cutis marmorata) are other possible symptoms. All of these are sometimes classified as manifestations of type 1 or \u201cmild\u201d DCS. type 2 or \u201cserious\u201d DCS can lead, among other things, to paralysis, brain damage, heart attacks, and death. Many DCS victims, however, experience both type 1 and type 2 symptoms. Diagnosis Diagnosis requires taking a medical history (ques- tioning the patient about his or her health and recent activities) and conducting a physical examination.

It is essential that the patient lie very still during the procedure to prevent motion blurring. In some studies, such as chest CTs, the patient will be asked to hold his or her breath during image capture. Following the procedure, films of the images are usually printed for the radiologist and referring physician to review. A radiologist can also interpret CT exams on a special computer screen. The procedure time will vary in length depending on the area being imaged. Average study times are from 30 to 60 minutes. Some patients may be concerned about claustrophobia, but the width of the \u201cdoughnut\u201d portion of the scanner is such that many patients can be reassured of openness. The CT image While traditional x rays image organs in two dimen- sions, with the possibility that organs in the front of the body are superimposed over those in the back, CT scans allow for a more three-dimensional effect. Some have compared CT images to slices in a loaf of bread. Precise sections of the body can be located and imaged as cross- sectional views. The screen before the technologist shows a computer\u2019s analysis of each section detected by the x-ray beam. Thus, various densities of tissue can be easily distinguished. Contrast agents Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and in other radiology procedures to illuminate certain details of anatomy which may not be easily seen. Some con- trasts are natural, such as air or water. Other times, a water-based contrast agent is administered for specific diagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate is commonly used in gastroenterology procedures. The patient may drink this contrast, or receive it in an enema. Oral and rectal con- trast are usually given when examining the abdomen or cells, and not given when scanning the brain or chest. Iodine is the most widely used intravenous contrast agent and is given through an intravenous needle. If contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these will be administered several minutes before the study begins. Abdominal CT patients may be asked to drink a contrast medium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flush- ing of the face, warmth or slight nausea, or hives from an intravenous contrast injection. Technologists and radiolo- gists have equipment and training to help patients through these minor reactions and to handle more severe reactions. Severe reactions to contrast are rare, but do occur. Spiral CT Spiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer version of CT scanning which is continuous in motion and allows for three-dimensional recreation of images. For example, traditional CT allows the technologist to take slices at very small and precise intervals one after the other. Spiral CT allows for a continuous flow of images, without stopping the scanner to move to the next image slice. A major advantage of spiral CT is the ability to reconstruct images anywhere along the length of the study area. The procedure also speeds up the imaging process, meaning less time for the patient to lie still. The ability to image contrast more rapidly after it is injected, when it is at its highest level, is another advantage of spi- ral CT\u2019s high speed. Some facilities will have both spiral and convention- al CT available. Although spiral is more advantageous for many applications, conventional CT is still a superior and precise method for imaging many tissues and struc- tures. The physician will evaluate which type of CT works best for the specific exam purpose. Preparation If a contrast medium is administered, the patient may be asked to fast from about four to six hours prior to the procedure. Patients will usually be given a gown (like a typical hospital gown) to be worn during the procedure. All metal and jewelry should be removed to avoid arti- facts on the film. Aftercare No aftercare is generally required following a CT scan. Immediately following the exam, the technologist will continue to watch the patient for possible adverse contrast reactions.

Hives may develop later and usually do not require treatment. Risks Radiation exposure from a CT scan is similar to, though higher than, that of a conventional x ray. Although this is a risk to pregnant women, the exposure to other adults is minimal and should produce no effects. Although severe contrast reactions are rare, they are a risk of many CT procedures. Normal results Normal findings on a CT exam show bone, the most dense tissue, as white areas. Tissues and fat will show as various shades of gray, and fluids will be gray or black. Air will also look black. Intravenous, oral, and rectal con- trast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determine if tissues and organs appear normal by the sensitivity of the gray shadows. In CT, the images that can cut through a section of tissue or organ provide three-dimensional viewing for the radiologist and referring physician. Abnormal results Abnormal results may show different characteristics of tissues within organs. Accumulations of blood or other fluids where they do not belong may be detected. Radiol- ogists can differentiate among types of tumors through- out the body by viewing details of their makeup. Sinus studies The increasing availability and lowered cost of CT scanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies, either as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a follow-up to an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of CT allows for location of areas of sinus infection, particularly chronic infection. CT scans can show the extent and loca- tion of tiny fractures to the sinus and nasal bones. Foreign bodies in the sinus and nasal area are also easily detected by CT. CT imaging of the sinuses is important in evaluat- ing trauma or disease of the sphenoid bone (the wedge shaped bone at the base of the skull). Sinus tumors will show as shades of gray indicating the difference in their density from that of normal tissues in the area. Brain studies The precise differences in density allowed by CT scan can clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the brain area as altered densities. These lighter or darker areas on the image may indicate a tumor or hematoma within the brain and skull area. Different types of tumors can be identified by the presence of edema, by the tissue\u2019s density, or by studying blood vessel location and activity. The speed and convenience of CT often allows for detection of hemorrhage before symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities in children, such as hydrocephalus, may also be confirmed with CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement of the fluid structures called ventricles of the brain. Body scans The body scan can identify abnormal body structures and organs. Throughout the body, a CT may indicate tumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes, abnormal collec- tions of fluids, blood or fat, and metastasis of cancer. Tumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeup than primary tumors, or those that originate in the loca- tion of study. Fractures or damage to soft tissues and liga- ments will be more easily seen on the sensitive images produced by CT scanning, though CT is not usually done for these. Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed or fatty liver, may be observed on the body scan. CT of the aorta CT provides the ability to see and measure the thick- ness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in diagnos- ing aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will help see details within the aorta. In addition, density can identify calcification, and this helps differentiate between acute and chronic problems. An abnormal CT scan may indi- cate signs of aortic clots. Aortic rupture is suggested by signs such as a hematoma around the aorta or the escape of blood from its cavity.

The test is designed to not be influenced by verbal ability, cultural climate, or educa- tional level. Purpose The purpose of a culture-fair test is to eliminate any social or cultural advantages, or disadvantages, that a person may have due to their upbringing. The test can be administered to anyone, from any nation, speaking any language. A culture-fair test may help identify learning or emotional problems. The duration of the test varies for the individual types of tests available, but the time is approximately between 12\u201318 minutes per section (a test usually has two to four sections). A culture-fair test is often administered by employ- ers in order to determine the best location for new employees in a large company. The wide variety of cul- ture-fair tests availiable allows the administrator to select which area is most vital, whether it be general intelligence, knowledge of a specific area, or emotional stability. Precautions There is doubt as to whether any test can truly be culturally unbiased or can ever be made completely fair to all persons independent of culture. There are no other precautions.

          "content": "Laboratory tests After taking the woman\u2019s history, the gynecologist or family practitioner does a pelvic examination and Pap smear. To rule out specific causes of abnormal bleeding, the doctor may also do a pregnancy test and blood tests to check the level of thyroid hormone. Based on the ini- tial test results, the doctor may want to do tests to deter- mine the level of other hormones that play a role in reproduction. A test of blood clotting time and an adrenal function test are also commonly done. Imaging Imaging tests are important diagnostic tools for eval- uating abnormal uterine bleeding. Ultrasound examina- tion of the pelvic and abdominal area is used to help locate uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyoma, a type of tumor. Visual examination through hysterscopy\u2014 where a camera inside a thin tube is inserted directly into the uterus so that the doctor can see the uterine lining\u2014is also used to assess the condition of the uterus. Hystersalpingography can help outline endometrial polyps and fibroids and help detect endometrial cancer. In this procedure an x ray is taken after contrast media has been injected into the cervix. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvic region can also be used to locate fibroids and tumors. Invasive procedures Endometrial biopsy (the removal and examination of endometrial tissue) is the most important testing proce- dure. It allows the doctor to sample small areas of the uter- ine lining, while cervical biopsy allows the cervix to be sampled. Tissues are then examined for any abnormalities. Dilation and curettage (D & C), once common is rarely done today for diagnosis of DUB. It is done while the patient is under either general or regional anesthesia. Women over 30 are more likely to need a D & C, as part of the diagnostic procedure, than younger women. Because DUB is diagnosed by eliminating other possible disorders, diagnosis can take a long time and involve many tests and procedures. Older women are likely to need more extensive tests than adolescents because the likelihood of reproductive cancers is greater in this age group, and therefore must be definitively eliminated before treating bleeding symptoms. Treatment Treatment of DUB depends on the cause of the bleeding and the age of the patient. When the underlying cause of the disorder is known, that disorder is treated. KEY TERMS Dilation and curettage (D & C) \u2014A procedure performed under anesthesia during which the cervix is dilated, and tissue lining the uterus is scraped out with a metal spoon-shaped instrument or a suction tube. The procedure can be either diagnostic, or to remove polyps. Endometrial biopsy \u2014The removal of tissue either by suction or scraping of samples of tissue from the uterus. The cervix is not dilated. The procedure has a lower rate of diagnostic accuracy than a D & C, but can be done as an office procedure under local anesthesia. Endometrial cancer\u2014Cancer of the inner mucous membrane of the uterus. Fibroids, or fibroid tumors \u2014Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus. They occur in 30\u201340% of women over age 40, and do not need to be removed unless they are causing symptoms that interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities. Hypothyroidism\u2014A disorder in which the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone causing a decrease in the rate of metabolism with associat- ed effects on the reproductive system. Lupus erythematosus \u2014A chronic inflammatory disease in which inappropriate immune system reactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels and connective tissue. Progesterone \u2014A hormone naturally secreted by the ovary, or manufactured synthetically, that prepares the uterus for implantation of a fertil- ized egg. Prostaglandins \u2014A group of chemicals that medi- ate, or determine the actions of other chemicals in the cell or body. Otherwise the goal of treatment is to relieve the symp- toms to a degree that uterine bleeding does not interfere with a woman\u2019s normal activities or cause anemia. Generally the first approach to controlling DUB is to use oral contraceptives that provide a balance between the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Oral contracep- tives are often very effective in adolescents and young women in their twenties. NSAIDs ( nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs ), like Naprosyn and Motrin, are also used to treat DUB. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1113 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding",

Normal results A radiologist, or physician specially trained in the technique and interpretation of x rays, will evaluate the results. A normal chest x ray will show normal structures for the age and medical history or the patient. Findings, whether normal or abnormal, will be provided to the referring physician in the form of a written report. Abnormal results Abnormal findings on chest x rays are used in con- junction with a physician\u2019s physical exam findings, patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to reach a final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays are more effective when compared to previous chest studies. The patient is asked to help the radiology facility in locating previous chest radiographs from other facilities. Pulmonary disorders Pneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches and irregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs). If the bronchi, which are usually not visible, can be seen, a diagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may be made. Shifts or shadows in the hila (lung roots) may indicate emphysema or a pulmonary abscess. Widening of the spaces between ribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases may also be detected or suspected through chest x ray. Cancer In nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort of abnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph. Hilar masses (enlargements at that part of the lungs where ves- sels and nerves enter) are one of the more common symptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid buildup on the outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas. Interstitial lung disease, which is a large category of dis- orders, many of which are related to exposure of sub- stances (such as asbestos fibers), may be detected on a chest x ray as fiberlike deposits, often in the lower por- tions of the lungs. Other Congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases may be indicated on the view of a heart and lung in a chest radiograph. Fractures of the sternum and ribs are usually easily detected as breaks on the chest x ray. In some instances, the radiologist\u2019s view of the diaphragm may indicate an abdominal problem. Tuberculosis can also be indicated by elevation of the diaphragm. Foreign bodies which may have been swallowed or inhaled can usually be located by the radiologist as they will look dif- ferent from any other tissue or structure in the chest.

Teresa Norris, RN Chickenpox Definition Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common and extremely infectious childhood disease that also affects adults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash that typically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompa- nied by a fever or other symptoms. A single attack of chickenpox almost always confers lifelong immunity against the disease. Because the symptoms of chicken- pox are easily recognized and in most cases merely unpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost always be carried out at home. Severe complications can develop, however, and professional medical attention is essential in some circumstances. Description Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children born each year in the United States contracted chicken- pox, resulting in hospitalization in five of every 1,000 cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari- cella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family), which is spread through the air or by direct contact with an infected person. Once someone has been infected with the virus, an incubation period of about 10\u201321 days pass- es before symptoms begin. The period during which infected people are able to spread the disease is believed to start one or two days before the rash breaks out and to continue until all the blisters have formed scabs, which usually happens fout to seven days after the rash breaks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 749 Chickenpox",

These scans allow for cross- sectional views of body organs and tissues. Purpose CT scans are used to image a wide variety of body structures and internal organs. Since the 1990s, CT equipment has become more affordable and available. In some diagnoses, CT scans have become the first imaging exam of choice. Because the computerized image is so sharp, focused, and three-dimensional, many tissues can be better differentiated than on standard x rays. Common CT indications include: \u2022 Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of sinusi- tis and bone fractures . Physicians may order a CT of the sinuses to provide an accurate map for surgery. \u2022 Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas, tumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning, especially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need for more invasive procedures such as cerebral angiography. \u2022 Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used to observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kid- neys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, and extremities. \u2022 Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or abdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possible aortic diseases. \u2022 Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in distin- guishing tumors and in detailing accumulation of fluid in chest infections. Precautions Pregnant women or those who could possibly be pregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnostic benefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients should par- ticularly avoid full body or abdominal scans. If the exam is necessary for obstetrics purposes, technologists are instructed not to repeat films if there are errors. Pregnant patients receiving CT or any x-ray exam away from the abdominal area may be protected by a lead apron; most radiation, known as scatter, travels through the body and is not blocked by the apron. Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and the use of these agents should be discussed with the medical professional prior to the procedure. Patients should be asked to sign a consent form concerning the administra- tion of contrast. One of the common contrast agents, iodine, can cause allergic reactions. Patients who are known to be allergic to iodine (or shellfish) should inform the physician prior to the CT scan. Description Computed tomography, also called CT scan, CAT scan, or computerized axial tomography, is a combina- tion of focused x-ray beams and computerized produc- tion of an image. Introduced in the early 1970s, this radi- ologic procedure has advanced rapidly and is now widely used, sometimes in the place of standard x rays. CT equipment A CT scan may be performed in a hospital or outpa- tient imaging center. Although the equipment looks large and intimidating, it is very sophisticated and fairly com- fortable. The patient is asked to lie on a gantry, or narrow table, that slides into the center of the scanner. The scan- ner looks like a doughnut and is round in the middle, which allows the x-ray beam to rotate around the patient. The scanner section may also be tilted slightly to allow for certain cross-sectional angles. CT procedure The patient will feel the gantry move very slightly as the precise adjustments for each sectional image are GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 875 Computed tomography scans",

          "content": "another surgical exploration. Those with recurrence in the same area as the original cancer, or with a single metastat- ic tumor in the liver or lung, have a chance that surgery will eliminate the disease. Patients with more widespread return of the cancer are generally not treatable with surgery. The CEA test will not separate the two groups. Patients who are most likely to benefit from non- standard treatments, such as bone marrow transplants, may be determined on the basis of CEA values, com- bined with other test results. CEA levels may be one of the criteria for determining whether the patient will bene- fit from more expensive studies, such as CT scan or MRI. Precautions The CEA test is not a screening test for cancer. It is not useful for detecting the presence of cancer. Many cancers do not produce an increased CEA level. Some noncancerous diseases, such as hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and obstructive pulmonary disease, may cause an elevated CEA level. Description Determination of the CEA level is a laboratory blood test. Obtaining a specimen of blood for the study takes only a few minutes. CEA testing should be covered by most insurance plans. Preparation No preparation is required. Aftercare None. Risks There are no complications or side effects of this test. However, the results of a CEA study should be inter- preted with caution. A single test result may not yield clinically useful information. Several studies over a peri- od of months may be needed. Another concern is the potential for false positive as well as false negative results. A false positive result means the test shows an abnormal value when cancer is not present. A false negative means the test reveals a nor- mal value when cancer actually is present. Normal results The absolute numbers which are considered normal vary from one laboratory to another. Any results reported should come with information regarding the testing facil- ity\u2019s normal range. Abnormal results A single abnormal CEA value may be significant, but must be regarded cautiously. In general, very high CEA levels indicate more serious cancer, with a poorer chance for cure.

Purpose The left ventricle is the main pump for distributing blood through the body. A cardiac blood pool scan is used to determine how efficiently the left ventricle is working. The scan can detect aneurysms of the left ven- tricle, motion abnormalities caused by damage to the heart wall, cardiac shunts between the left and right ven- tricle, and coronary occlusive artery disease. Precautions Pregnant women are the only patients who should not participate in a cardiac blood pool scan. However, the accuracy of the results may be affected if the patient moves during imaging, has had other recent nuclear scans, or has an irregular heartbeat.

Unfortu- nately, these symptoms can be confused with tension headaches or migraines, and treatment can be delayed until rupture occurs. When an aneurysm ruptures, most victims experi- ence a sudden, extremely severe headache. This headache is typically described as the worst headache of the victim\u2019s life. Nausea and vomiting commonly accompany the headache. The person may experience a short loss of consciousness or prolonged coma. Other common signs of a SAH include a stiff neck,fever, and a sensitivity to light. About 25% of victims experience neurological problems linked to specific areas of the brain, swelling of the brain due to fluid accumulation (hydrocephalus), or seizure. Diagnosis Based on the clinical symptoms, a doctor will run several tests to confirm an aneurysm or an SAH. A com- puted tomography (CT) scan of the head is the initial procedure. A magnetic resonance imaging test (MRI) may be done instead of a CT scan. MRI, however, is not as sensitive as CT for detecting subarachnoid blood. A CT scan can determine whether there has been a hemor- rhage and can assist in pinpointing the location of the aneurysm. The scan is most useful when it is done within KEY TERMS Congenital\u2014Existing at birth.

If the CT scan is negative for a hemorrhage or pro- vides an unclear diagnosis, the doctor will order a cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) analysis , also called a lumbar puncture. In this procedure, a small amount of cere- brospinal fluid is removed from the lower back and examined for traces of blood and blood-breakdown prod- ucts. If this test is positive, cerebral angiography is used to map the brain\u2019s blood vessels and the damaged area. The angiography is done to pinpoint the aneurysm\u2019s location. About 15% of people who experience SAH have more than one aneurysm. For this reason, angiogra- phy should include both the common carotid artery that feeds the front of the brain and the vertebral artery that feeds the base of the brain. Occasionally, the angiogra- phy fails to find the aneurysm and must be repeated. If seizures occur, electroencephalography (EEG) may be used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. Treatment Unruptured aneurysm If an aneurysm has not ruptured and is not causing any symptoms, it may be left untreated. Because there is a 1\u20132% chance of rupture per year, the cumulative risk over a number of years may justify surgical treatment. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 699 Cerebral aneurysm",

Cryosurgery see Cryotherapy Cryotherapy Definition Cryotherapy is a technique that uses an extremely cold liquid or instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal skin cells that require removal. The technique has been in use since the turn of the century, but modern techniques have made it widely available to dermatologists and pri- mary care doctors. The technique is also called cryosurgery. Purpose Cryotherapy can be employed to destroy a variety of benign skin growths, such as warts, pre-cancerous lesions (such as actinic keratoses), and malignant lesions (such as basal cell and squamous cell cancers). The goal of cryotherapy is to freeze and destroy targeted skin growths while preserving the surrounding skin from injury. Precautions Cryotherapy is not recommended for certain areas of the body because of the danger of destruction of tissue or unacceptable scarring. These areas include: skin that overlies nerves, the corners of the eyes, the fold of skin between the nose and lip, the skin surrounding the nos- trils, and the border between the lips and the rest of the face. Lesions that are suspected or known to be malig- nant melanoma should not be treated with cryotherapy, but should instead be removed surgically. Similarly, basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas that have reappeared at the site of a previously treated tumor should also be removed surgically. If it remains unclear whether a growth is benign or malignant, a sample of tissue should be removed for analysis (biopsy) by a pathologist before any attempts to destroy the lesion with cryotherapy. Care should be taken in people with diabetes or certain circula- tion problems when cryotherapy is considered for growths located on their lower legs, ankles, and feet. In these patients, healing can be poor and the risk of infec- tion can be higher than for other patients. Description There are three main techniques to performing cryotherapy.

At a temperature of -320\u00b0F (-196\u00b0C), liquid nitrogen is the coldest cryogen available. The goal is to freeze the skin growth as quickly as possible, and then let it thaw slowly to cause maximum destruction of the skin cells. A second application may be necessary depending on the size of the growth. In another cryotherapy technique, a device is used to direct a small spray of liquid nitrogen or other cryogen directly onto the skin growth. Freezing may last from five to 20 seconds, depending on the size of the lesion. A second freeze-thaw cycle may be required. Sometimes, the physician will insert a small needle connected to a thermometer into the lesion to make certain the lesion is cooled to a low enough temperature to guarantee maximum destruction. In a third option, liquid nitrogen or another cryogen is cir- culated through a probe to cool it to low temperatures. The probe is then brought into direct contact with the skin lesion to freeze it. The freeze time can take two to three times longer than with the spray technique. Preparation Extensive preparation prior to cryotherapy is not required. The area to be treated should be clean and dry, but sterile preparation is not necessary. Patients should know that they will experience some pain at the time of the freezing, but local anesthesia is usually not required. The physician may want to reduce the size of certain growths, such as warts, prior to the cryotherapy proce- dure, and may have patients apply salicylic acid prepara- tions to the growth over several weeks. Sometimes, the physician will pare away some of the tissue using a device called a curette or a scalpel. Aftercare Redness, swelling, and the formation of a blister at the site of cryotherapy are all expected results of the treatment. A gauze dressing is applied and patients should wash the site three or four times daily while fluid continues to ooze from the wound, usually for five to 14 days. A dry crust then forms that falls off by itself. Woundson the head and neck may take four to six weeks to heal, but those on the body, arms, and legs can take longer. Some patients experi- ence pain at the site following the treatment. This can usu- ally be eased with acetaminophen (Tylenol), though in some cases a stronger pain reliever may be required.

It rarely spreads (metasticizes), but is locally invasive. Cryogen\u2014A substance with a very low boiling point, such as liquid nitrogen, used in cryotherapy treatment. Melanoma \u2014The most dangerous form of skin cancer. It should not be treated with cryotherapy, but should be removed surgically instead. Squamous cell cancer\u2014A form of skin cancer that usually originates in sun-damaged areas or pre- existing lesions; at first local and superficial, it may later spread to other areas of the body. dates for other surgical procedures. As with other surgi- cal procedures, there is some risk of scarring, infection, and damage to underlying skin and tissue. These risks are generally minimal in the hands of experienced users of cryotherapy. Normal results Some redness, swelling, blistering and oozing of fluid are all common results of cryotherapy. Healing time can vary by the site treated and the cryotherapy technique used. When cryogen is applied directly to the growth, healing may occur in three weeks. Growths treated on the head and neck with the spray technique may take four to six weeks to heal; growths treated on other areas of the body may take considerably longer. Cryotherapy boasts high success rates in permanently removing skin growths; even for malignant lesions such as squamous cell and basal cell cancers, studies have shown a cure rate of up to 98%. For certain types of growths, such as some forms of warts, repeat treatments over several weeks are necessary to prevent the growth\u2019s return.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Colchicine see Gout drugs COLD see Chronic obstructive lung disease Cold agglutinins test Definition The cold agglutinins test is performed to detect the presence of antibodies in blood that are sensitive to tem- perature changes. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to specific disease agents; autoantibodies are antibodies that the body pro- duces against one of its own substances. Cold agglutinins are autoantibodies that cause red blood cells to clump, but only when the blood is cooled below the normal body temperature of 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). The clumping is most pro- nounced at temperatures below 78\u00b0F (25.6\u00b0C). Purpose The cold agglutinins test is used to confirm the diag- nosis of certain diseases that stimulate the body to pro- duce cold agglutinins. The disease most commonly diag- nosed by this test is mycoplasmal pneumonia ,b u t mononucleosis, mumps, measles , scarlet fever , some parasitic infections, cirrhosis of the liver, and some types of hemolytic anemia can also cause the formation of cold agglutinins. Hemolytic anemias are conditions in which the blood is low in oxygen because the red blood cells are breaking down at a faster rate than their normal life expectancy of 120 days. In addition to these illness- es, some people have a benign condition called chronic cold agglutinin disease, in which exposure to cold causes temporary clumping of red blood cells and consequent numbness in ears, fingers, and toes. Description Since cold agglutinins cause red blood cells to clump only at temperatures lower than 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), the test consists of chilling a sample of the patient\u2019s blood. There is a bedside version of the test in which the doctor collects four or five drops of blood in a small tube, KEY TERMS Agglutinin \u2014An antibody that causes red blood cells to stick or clump together. Antibody \u2014A protein molecule produced by the immune system that is specific to a disease agent, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae . The antibody combines with the organism and disables it. Autoantibody \u2014An antibody produced by the body in reaction to any of its own cells or cell products. Cold agglutinins\u2014Antibodies that cause clumping of red blood cells when the blood temperature falls below normal body temperature (98.6\u00b0F/37\u00b0C). Hemolytic anemia \u2014Oxygen deficiency in the blood, caused by shortened survival of red blood cells. Mycoplasma\u2014A type of free-living microorganism that has no cell wall. Mycoplasmas cause some varieties of pneumonia and urinary tract infections that stimulate the body to produce cold agglutinins. Titer\u2014The concentration of a substance in a given sample of blood or other tissue fluid. cools the tube in ice water for 30\u201360 seconds, and looks for clumping of red blood cells. If the cells clump after chilling and unclump as they rewarm, a cold agglutinin titer (concentration) greater than 1:64 is present. Bedside test results, however, should be confirmed by a laborato- ry. The laboratory test measures the clumping of red blood cells in different dilutions of the patient\u2019s blood serum at 39.2\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). Normal results The results of the cold agglutinins test require a doc- tor\u2019s interpretation. In general, however, a normal value is lower than 1:32. Abnormal results Any value higher than 1:32 suggests a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia or one of the other viral infec- tions or disease conditions indicated by this test.

The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that pre- vents food and fluid from entering the trachea. The infection causes it to become swollen, potentially blocking the airway.

Purpose Cryoglobulin clumps in cold temperatures. This physical characteristic causes people with cryoglobulin to have symptoms during cold weather: blanching, numbness, and pain in their fingers or toes (Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon); bleeding into the skin (purpura); and pain in joints (arthralgia). People with these symptoms or any other symptoms that appear in cold weather should be tested for cryoglobulin. Diseases that cause the body to make extra or abnor- mal proteins are often associated with cryoglobulin. These diseases include cancers involving white blood cells, infections, autoimmune disorders , and rheuma- toid diseases. This test provides information about the cause of symptoms in a person who already has a disease process. It doesn\u2019t diagnose a specific disease or monitor the course of a disease. Precautions This test is not a screening test for disease in a per- son without symptoms. Description Laboratory testing for cryoglobulin is based on the fact that cryoglobulin clumps when cooled and dissolves when warmed. The test is done on a person\u2019s serum (the yellow liquid part of blood that separates from the cells after the blood clots). The serum is kept warm from the time drawn until the cells and the serum are separated in the laboratory. The serum is placed at 33.8\u00b0F (1\u00b0C) for one to seven days. If there is clumping, cryoglobulins are present. The amount of cryoglobulins is determined by measuring the amount of clumping. Negative tests are checked through seven days. Additional testing is done to find out what kind of cryoglobulin protein is present. There are three kinds of cryoglobulin, each associated with different diseases. The test, also called the cold sensitivity antibodies test, is covered by insurance when medically necessary. Results are usually available the following day.

Frey Cold sensitivity antibodies test see Cryoglobulin test Cold sore Definition A cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually appears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus infection. Description A cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is usually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold sore are fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi- alis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur on the lips which distinguishes them from the common canker sore, which is usually inside the mouth. Cold sores do not usually occur inside the mouth except dur- ing the initial episode. Canker sores usually form either on the tongue or inside the cheeks. Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are eight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only two of these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause cold sores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virus type 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virus type 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely true. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her- pes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent cold sores are almost always type 1. Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of Americans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% of those infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most of these persons became infected before age 10. Anyone can become infected by herpes virus and, once infected, the virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses are spread from person to person by direct skin-to-skin con- tact. The highest risk for spreading the virus is the time period beginning with the appearance of blisters and end- ing with scab formation. However, infected persons need not have visible blisters to spread the infection to others since the virus may be present in the saliva without obvi- ous oral lesions. Viruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria are independent and can reproduce on their own, viruses enter human cells and force them to make more virus. The infected human cell is usually killed and releases thou- sands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tissue damage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, the her- pes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cell produce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits. The herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This is called \u201clatency.\u201d A latent virus can wait inside the nervous system for days, months, or even years. At some future time, the virus \u201cawakens\u201d and causes the cell to produce thousands of new viruses that cause an active infection. This process of latency and active infection is best understood by considering the cold sore cycle. An active infection is obvious because cold sores are present. The first infection is called the \u201cprimary\u201d infection. This active infection is then controlled by the body\u2019s immune system and the sores heal. In between active infections, the virus is latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses become activated and once again cause sores. These are called \u201crecurrent\u201d infections. Although it is unknown what trig- gers latent virus to activate, several conditions seem to bring on infections. These include stress, illness, tired- ness, exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet. Causes and symptoms While anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not everyone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of herpes occur within two-20 days after contact with an infected person. Symptoms of the primary infection are usually more severe than those of recurrent infections. The primary infection can cause symptoms like other viral infections including tiredness, headache, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Typically, 50-80% of persons with oral herpes expe- rience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of pain, burning, itching, or tingling at the site where blis- ters will form. This prodrome stage may last anywhere from a few hours to one to two days. The herpes infec- tion prodrome occurs in both the primary infection and recurrent infections. In 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters occur at the outer edge of the lips which is called the \u201cvermilion border.\u201d Less often, blisters form on the nose, chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the disease process is rapid. First, small red bumps appear that quickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters may either burst and form a scab or dry up and form a scab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all the blis- ters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely and without scarring within six to ten days. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 844 Cold sore",

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

Maureen Haggerty Delavirdine see Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Delayed hypersensitivity skin test Definition A delayed hypersensitivity test (DHT) is an immune function test measuring the presence of activated T cells that recognize a certain substance. Purpose The immune system protects against infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. After initial expo- sure to a foreign substance, or antigen, the immune sys- tem creates both antibodies and sensitized T cells. Both these immune agents respond when the body is reex- posed to the antigen. Antibodies, which are circulating proteins, respond within minutes, to give what is termed an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. T cells\u2019 respons- es occur over several days, and are thus called delayed hypersensitivity reactions. The cascade of events initiat- ed by the T cells leads to hardening (induration) and red- ness (erythema) at the injection site. A DHT is performed for one of three reasons: \u2022 To test for exposure to specific diseases, such as tuber- culosis (TB). Tuberculosis testing is done by injecting into the skin a small volume of TB antigen, which con- tains no organisms (live or dead) but can still provoke an immune response. \u2022 To test for allergic sensitivity to potential skin irritants, such as poison ivy. Skin allergy testing is usually done by placing a series of adhesive patches on the skin con- taining potential allergens, or allergy-causing sub- stances. \u2022 To assess the vitality of the T cell response as part of the evaluation of immune system health in infection, cancer, immune disorders, pre-transplantation screen- ing, aging , and malnutrition . DHT can help predict survival in immunocompromised patients, and evalu- ate the success of restorative therapy. Antigens used for these tests must be ones the patient has been exposed to before, and, therefore, include inactivated antigens from common infectious agents to which the patient might have been exposed, such as mumps , Candida albicans , tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton (a skin fungus). Precautions No special precautions are necessary for most patients. Those with known hypersensitivity to certain skin irritants should alert the clinician performing the test. Some commercial preparations of fungal antigens contain mercury, a source of irritation to some patients. Description The most accurate TB test is the Mantoux test, in which a small amount of TB antigen is injected into the skin. The area is examined 48\u201372 hours after the injection. In the patch test, 20\u201330 adhesive patches are usually placed on the upper back. The patches are kept in place and the area is kept dry for 48 hours. The patches are then removed, and the skin is examined 24 hours after- ward, and possibly again a day or more following that. Patch testing is usually performed following a patient complaint of skin irritation from an unknown substance. Testing may suggest several candidates; identifying the right one requires careful review of the patient\u2019s possi- ble exposure. The test of overall T cell responsiveness is per- formed with several injections. Each area injected is cir- cled and marked. Results are read 48 hours after the injection. Preparation No special preparation is necessary. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1019 Delayed hypersensitivity skin test",

When a stressful or traumatic experience triggers the reemergence of these dissociated parts, the patient may act differently, answer to a different name, or appear confused by his or her surroundings. Diagnosis When a doctor is evaluating a patient with dissocia- tive symptoms, he or she will first rule out physical con- ditions that sometimes produce amnesia, depersonaliza- tion, or derealization. These physical conditions include epilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med- ications, substance abuse, intoxication, AIDS, dementia complex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress and sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give the patient an electroencephalogram (EEG) to exclude epilepsy or other seizure disorders. If the patient appears to be physically normal, the doctor will rule out psychotic disturbances, including schizophrenia . In addition, doctors can use some psy- chological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen- er, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). If the patient has a high score on this test, he or she can be eval- uated further with the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). It is also pos- sible for doctors to measure a patient\u2019s hypnotizability as part of a diagnostic evaluation. Treatment Treatment of the dissociative disorders often com- bines several methods. Psychotherapy Patients with dissociative disorders often require treatment by a therapist with some specialized under- standing of dissociation. This background is particularly important if the patient\u2019s symptoms include identity problems. Many patients with dissociative disorders are helped by group as well as individual treatment. Medications Some doctors will prescribe tranquilizers or antide- pressants for the anxiety and/or depression that often accompany dissociative disorders. Patients with dissocia- tive disorders are, however, at risk for abusing or becom- ing dependent on medications. As of 2001, there is no drug that can reliably counteract dissociation itself. Hypnosis Hypnosis is frequently recommended as a method of treatment for dissociative disorders, partly because hyp- KEY TERMS Amnesia \u2014A general medical term for loss of memory that is not due to ordinary forgetfulness. Amnesia can be caused by head injuries, brain disease, or epilepsy, as well as by dissociation. Depersonalization \u2014A dissociative symptom in which the patient feels that his or her body is unre- al, is changing, or is dissolving. Derealization \u2014A dissociative symptom in which the external environment is perceived as unreal. Dissociation \u2014A psychological mechanism that allows the mind to split off traumatic memories or disturbing ideas from conscious awareness. Fugue\u2014A dissociative experience during which a person travels away from home, has amnesia for their past, and may be confused about their identi- ty but otherwise appear normal. Hypnosis\u2014The means by which a state of extreme relaxation and suggestibility is induced: used to treat amnesia and identity disturbances that occur in dissociative disorders.

Trauma\u2014A disastrous or life-threatening event that can cause severe emotional distress, includ- ing dissociative symptoms and disorders. nosis is related to the process of dissociation. Hypnosis may help patients recover repressed ideas and memories. Therapists treating patients with DID sometimes use hypnosis in the process of \u201cfusing\u201d the patient\u2019s alternate personalities. Prognosis Prognoses for dissociative disorders vary. Recovery from dissociative fugue is usually rapid. Dissociative amnesia may resolve quickly, but can become a chronic disorder in some patients. Depersonalization disorder, DDNOS, and DID are usually chronic conditions. DID usually requires five or more years of treatment for recovery.

The most important part of diagnosis is determining the cause of the delirium. Tests may include blood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec- trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum- bar puncture (\u201cspinal tap\u201d) to test for central nervous system infection; x ray, computed tomography scans (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali- ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec- trocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated by the likely cause. Treatment Treatment of delirium begins with recognizing and treating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managed by reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothing ones; use of simple, clear language in communication; and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi- cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger to himself or others, or if he insists on removing necessary medical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors. Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions. Prognosis Persons with delirium usually have a worse prog- nosis for the underlying disease than the person with- out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill- ness usually recover from delirium. They may not, however, regain all their original cognitive abilities, and may be left with some permanent impairments, including fatigue , irritability, difficulty concentrating, or mood changes. Prevention Prevention of delirium is focused on treating or avoiding its underlying causes. The most preventable forms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducing delirium include following prescriptions, consulting the prescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur, and consulting the physician before discontinuing the drug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica- tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professional assistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive drug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri- tion, which promotes general health and can minimize the likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication and withdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti- cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home or workplace.

These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning, and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre- sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompanied by hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia , which act to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusions are distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefs that may be seen as untrue by outsiders. Description Delusions are a common symptom of several mood and personality-related mental illnesses, including schizoaffective disorder , schizophrenia , shared psy- chotic disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder . They are also the major feature of delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder suffer from long-term, complex delusions that fall into one of six categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero- tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusional disorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or physical causes. Persecutory Individuals with persecutory delusional disorder are plagued by feelings of paranoia and an irrational yet unshakable belief that someone is plotting against them, or out to harm them.

Description Electrolytes are ionized molecules found throughout the blood, tissues, and cells of the body. These mole- cules, which are either positive (cations) or negative (anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance pH and acid-base levels in the body. Electrolytes also facilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells through a process known as osmosis and play a part in regulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine, and excretory systems. The serum electrolytes include: \u2022 Sodium (Na). A positively charged electrolyte that helps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates neuromuscular functioning. \u2022 Potassium (K). A main component of cellular fluid, this positive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular function and osmotic pressure. \u2022 Calcium (Ca). A cation, or positive electrolyte, that affects neuromuscular performance and contributes to skeletal growth and blood coagulation. \u2022 Magnesium (Mg). Influences muscle contractions and intracellular activity. A cation. \u2022 Chloride (CI). An anion, or negative electrolyte, that regulates blood pressure. \u2022 Phosphate (HPO4). Negative electrolyte that impacts metabolism and regulates acid-base balance and calci- um levels. \u2022 Bicarbonate (HCO3). A negatively charged electrolyte that assists in the regulation of blood pH levels. Bicar- bonate insufficiencies and elevations cause acid-base disorders (i.e., acidosis, alkalosis). Medications, chronic diseases, and trauma (i.e., burns, fractures, etc. ) may cause the concentration of certain electrolytes in the body to become too high (hyper-) or too low (hypo-). When this happens, an elec- trolyte imbalance, or disorder, results. Causes and symptoms Sodium HYPERNATREMIA. Sodium helps the kidneys to regu- late the amount of water the body retains or excretes. Consequently, individuals with elevated serum sodium levels also suffer from a loss of fluids, or dehydration . Hypernatremia can be caused by inadequate water intake, excessive fluid loss (i.e., diabetes insipidus, kid- ney disease, severe burns, and prolonged vomiting or diarrhea), or sodium retention (caused by excessive sodi- um intake or aldosteronism).

Diagnosis Diagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological exam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. A thorough family history should be taken at this time to deter- mine if other people in the family are affected. Testing may also be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy. A nerve conduction velocity test should be per- formed to measure how fast impulses travel through the nerves. This test may show characteristic features of CMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conduction testing may be combined with electromyography (EMG), an electrical test of the muscles. A nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the nerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris- tic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic of CMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet- ic testing, usually performed by drawing a small amount of blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detect mutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However, research is progressing rapidly and new testing is often made available every few months. All affected members of a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once a mutation is found in one affected member, it is possible to test other members who may have symptoms or are at risk of developing CMT. Prenatal diagnosis Testing during pregnancy to determine whether an unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a family has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation. This can be done after 10\u201312 weeks of pregnancy using a procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam- ining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente- sis after 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing the cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a small risk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are interested in learning more should check with their doctor or genetic counselor. Couples interested in these options should obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all of the benefits and limitations of these procedures. Treatment There is no cure for CMT. However, physical and occupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat- ment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motion and minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, or contracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control of the lower extremities that can help tremendously with balance. After wearing braces, people often find that they have more energy because they are using less energy to focus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used to provide devices and techniques that can assist tasks such as dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities of daily life. V oice-activated software can also help people who have problems with fine motor control. It is very important that people with CMT avoid injury that causes them to be immobile for long periods of time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to return to their original strength after injury. There is a long list of medications that should be avoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such as hydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B6, and D, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com- plete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo- ple considering taking any of these medications should weigh the risks and benefits with their physician. Prognosis The symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly over many years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy. The majority of people with CMT do not need to use a wheelchair during their lifetime. Most people with CMT are able to lead full and productive lives despite their physical challenges.

          "content": "order or illness the EEG is evaluating, patients should check with their individual insurance plan. Preparation Full instructions should be given to EEG patients when they schedule their test. Typically, individuals on medications that affect the central nervous system, such as anticonvulsants, stimulants, or antidepressants, are told to discontinue their prescription for a short time prior to the test (usually one to two days). Patients may be asked to avoid food and beverages that contain caf- feine, a central nervous system stimulant. However, any such request should be cleared by the treating physician. Patients may also be asked to arrive for the test with clean hair free of spray or other styling products. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG may be asked to remain awake the night before their test. They may be given a sedative prior to the test to induce sleep. Aftercare If the patient has suspended regular medication for the test, the EEG nurse or technician should advise him when he can begin taking it again. Risks Being off medication for one to two days may trigger seizures. Certain procedures used during EEG may trig- ger seizures in patients with epilepsy. Those procedures include flashing lights and deep breathing. If the EEG is being used as a diagnostic for epilepsy (i.e., to determine the type of seizures an individual is suffering from), this may be a desired effect, although the patient needs to be monitored closely so that the seizure can be aborted if necessary. This type of test is known as an ictal EEG. Normal results In reading and interpreting brainwave patterns, a neurologist or other physician will evaluate the type of brainwaves and the symmetry, location, and consistency of brainwave patterns. He will also look at the brain- wave response to certain stimuli presented during the EEG test (such as flashing lights or noise). There are four basic types of brainwaves: alpha, beta, theta, and delta. \u201cNormal\u201d brainwave patterns vary widely, depending on factors of age and activity. For example, awake and relaxed individuals typically register an alpha wave pattern of eight to 13 cycles per second.

Proponents claim it also treats coronary artery disease and other illnesses that may be linked to damage from free radicals (reactive molecules). Purpose The benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment of lead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels are undisputed. The claims of benefits for those suffering from atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and other degenerative diseases are more difficult to prove. Report- ed uses for chelation therapy include treatment of angi- na, gangrene, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, psoriasis , and Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Improve- ment is also claimed for people experiencing diminished sight, hearing, smell, coordination, and sexual potency. Description Origins The term chelation is from the Greek root word \u201cchele,\u201d meaning \u201cclaw.\u201d Chelating agents, most com- monly diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were originally designed for industrial applications in the early 1900s. It was not until the World War II era that the potential for medical therapy was realized. The initial intent was to develop antidotes to poison gas and radioactive contami- nants. The need for widespread therapy of this nature did not materialize, but more practical uses were found for chelation. During the following decade, EDTA chelation therapy became standard treatment for people suffering from lead poisoning . Patients who had received this treatment claimed to have other health improvements that could not be attributed to the lead removal only. Especially notable were comments from those who had previously suffered from intermittent claudication and angina. They reported suffering less pain and fatigue , with improved endurance, after chelation therapy. These reports stimulated further interest in the potential bene- fits of chelation therapy for people suffering from athero- sclerosis and coronary artery disease. If the preparatory examination suggests that there is a condition that could be improved by chelation therapy, and there is no health reason why it shouldn\u2019t be used, then the treatment can begin. The patient is generally taken to a comfortable treatment area, sometimes in a group loca- tion, and an intravenous line is started. A solution of EDTA together with vitamins and minerals tailored for the individual patient is given. Most treatments take three to four hours, as the infusion must be given slowly in order to be safe. The number of recommended treatments is usu- ally between 20 and 40. They are given one to three times a week. Maintenance treatments can then be given at the rate of once or twice a month. Maximum benefits are reportedly attained after approximately three months after a treatment series. The cost of therapy is considerable, but it is a fraction of the cost of an expensive medical proce- dure like cardiac bypass surgery. Intravenous vitamin C and mercury chelation therapies are also offered. Preparations A candidate for chelation therapy should initially have a thorough history and physical to define the type and extent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will be done to determine whether there are any conditions present that would prevent the use of chelation. Patients who have pre- existing hypocalcemia, poor liver or kidney function, con- gestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, tuberculosis, clot- ting problems, or potentially allergic conditions are at higher risk for complications from chelation therapy. A Doppler ultrasound may be performed to determine the adequacy of blood flow in different regions of the body. Precautions It is important for people who receive chelation ther- apy to work with medical personnel who are experienced in the use of this treatment. Treatment should not be undertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evaluation, history, and any laboratory tests necessary are per- formed. The staff must be forthcoming about test results and should answer any questions the patient may have. Evaluation and treatment should be individualized and involve assessment of kidney function before each treat- ment with chelation, since the metals bound by the EDTA are excreted through the kidneys. Although EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like mercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essential nutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium, zinc, and magnesium. Large amounts of zinc are lost during chelation. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired immune function and other harmful effects. Supplements of zinc are generally given to patients undergoing chelation, but it is not known whether this is adequate to prevent defi- ciency. Also, chelation therapy does not replace proper nutrition , exercise , and appropriate medications or surgery for specific diseases or conditions.

Grant Electroconvulsive therapy Definition Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat- ment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefully controlled amount of electricity is introduced into the brain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction with anesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces a mild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in the treatment of severe depression, and provides the most rapid relief currently available for this illness. Purpose The purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses such as severe depression, mania, and schizophrenia. ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement because they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat or drink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, or present some other danger to themselves. Antidepressant medications, while effective in many cases, may take two to six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychotic medications used to treat mania and schizophrenia have many uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side effects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel- op allergiesand therefore are unable to take their medicine. Precautions The most common risks associated with ECT are disturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bones occur very rarely. Description The treatment of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy was introduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerletti and Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con- vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since, according to their obervations, this disease rarely occurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. They concluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi- cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illness could be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari- ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their patients died or suffered severe injuries because the strength of the convulsions could not be well controlled. Electroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro- versial of all procedures used to treat mental illness. When it was first introduced, many people were fright- ened simply because it was called \u201cshock treatment.\u201d Many assumed the procedure would be painful, others thought it was a form of electrocution, and still others believed it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately, unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and movies added to these fears. Indeed, in those early years, patients and families were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this or other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result, patients had violent seizures, and even though they did not remember them, the procedure itself was frightening. The way these treatments are given today is very dif- ferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently, ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen, suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to deal with the rare emergency. The treatment is carried out as follows: approxi- mately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time, the patient may receive an injection of a medication (such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas- ing too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient is placed on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat- ically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon- itor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol- lowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes all of the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, and the risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated. When the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air- way is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec- trodes are placed on the sides of the head in the temple areas.

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test.

Barstow, RN Electrocution see Electric shock injuries Electroencephalography Definition Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a neurological test that uses an electronic monitoring device to measure and record electrical activity in the brain. Purpose The EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage- ment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also used to assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g., stroke, tumors, encephalitis), mental retardation, sleep disorders, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s dis- ease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and certain mental disor- ders (e.g.,alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism). An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity during surgery and to determine brain death. Precautions Electroencephalography should be administered and interpreted by a trained medical professional only. Data from an EEG is only one element of a complete medical and/or psychological patient assessment, and should never be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis. Description Before the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach- es approximately 16\u201320 electrodes to the patient\u2019s scalp with a conductive, washable paste. Depending on the purpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodes are occasionally used. Implantable electrodes include sphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires inserted under the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec- trodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain. The EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea- sure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain. For the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table, or comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain still during the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes no more than one hour. During the test procedure, the patient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visual stimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board may be used to stimulate certain types of brain activity. Throughout the procedure, the electroencephalograph machine makes a continuous graphic record of the patient\u2019s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip of recording paper or on a computer screen. This graphic record is called an electroencephalogram. The sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce- dures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG are encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than just relax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet room conducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours. In an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a portable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor- mal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for a period of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patient and patient\u2019s family record any symptoms or abnormal behaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG to see if they represent seizures. Many insurance plans provide reimbursement for EEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to more than $500, depending on the purpose and type of test (i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec- trodes).

People who are trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion (CPR) should, if appropriate, begin first aid while waiting for emergency medical help to arrive. Burn victims usually require treatment at a burn cen- ter. Fluid replacement therapy is necessary to restore lost fluids and electrolytes. Severely injured tissue is repaired surgically, which can involve skin grafting or amputa- tion. Antibiotics and antibacterial creams are used to prevent infection. Victims may also require treatment for kidney failure. Following surgery, physical therapy to facilitate recovery, and psychological counseling to cope with disfigurement, may be necessary. Prognosis Electric shocks cause death in 3\u201315% of cases. Many survivors require amputation or are disfigured by their burns. Injuries from household appliances and other low- voltage sources are less likely to produce extreme damage. KEY TERMS Antibiotics\u2014Substances used against microorgan- isms that cause infection.

Prevention Parents and other adults need to be alert to possible electric dangers in the home. Damaged electric appliances, wiring, cords, and plugs should be repaired or replaced. Electrical repairs should be attempted only by people with the proper training. Hair dryers, radios, and other electric appliances should never be used in the bathroom or any- where else they might accidentally come in contact with water. Young children need to be kept away from electric appliances and should be taught about the dangers of elec- tricity as soon as they are old enough. Electric outlets require safety covers in homes with young children. During thunderstorms, people should go indoors immediately, even if no rain is falling, and boaters should return to shore as rapidly as possible. People who cannot reach indoor shelter should move away from metallic objects such as golf clubs and fishing rods and lie down in low-ground areas. Standing or lying under or next to tall or metallic structures is unsafe. An automobile is appropriate cover, as long as the radio is off. Telephones, computers, hair dryers, and other appliances that can act as conduits for lightning should not be used during thunderstorms.

          "content": "route. Treatment begins by rewarming the affected part for 15\u201330 minutes in water at a temperature of 104\u2013108\u00b0F (40\u201342.2\u00b0C). This rapid rewarming halts ice crystal formation and dilates narrowed blood vessels. Aloe vera (which acts against inflammatory mediators) is applied to the affected part, which is then splinted, ele- vated, and wrapped in a dressing. Depending on the extent of injury, blisters may be debrided (cleaned by removing foreign material) or simply covered with aloe vera. A tetanus shot and, possibly, penicillin, are used to prevent infection, and the patient is given ibuprofen to combat inflammation. Narcotics are needed in most cases to reduce the excruciating pain that occurs as sen- sation returns during rewarming. Except when injury is minimal, treatment generally requires a hospital stay of several days, during which hydrotherapy and physical therapy are used to restore the affected part to health. Experts recommend a cautious approach to tissue removal, and advise that 22\u201345 days must pass before a decision on amputation can safely be made. Frostnip Frostnipped fingers are helped by blowing warm air on them or holding them under one\u2019s armpits. Other frostnipped areas can be covered with warm hands. The injured areas should never be rubbed. Alternative treatment Alternative practitioners suggest several kinds of treatment to speed recovery from frostbite after leaving the hospital. Bathing the affected part in warm water or using contrast hydrotherapy can help enhance circulation. Con- trast hydrotherapy involves a series of hot and cold water applications. A hot compress (as hot as the patient can stand) is applied to the affected area for three minutes fol- lowed by an ice cold compress for 30 seconds. These applications are repeated three times each, ending with the cold compress. Nutritional therapy to promote tissue growth in damaged areas may also be helpful. Homeo- pathic and botanical therapies may also assist recovery from frostbite. Homeopathic Hypericum (Hypericum per- foratum) is recommended when nerve ending are affected (especially in the fingers and toes) and Arnica (Arnica montana) is prescribed for shock. Cayenne pepper (Cap- sicum frutescens) can enhance circulation and relieve pain. Drinking hot ginger (Zingiber officinale) tea also aids cir- culation. Other possible approaches include acupuncture to avoid permanent nerve damage and oxygen therapy. Prognosis The rapid rewarming approach to frostbite treatment, pioneered in the 1980s, has proved to be much more effective than older methods in preventing tissue loss and amputation. A study of 56 first-, second-, and third-degree frostbite patients treated with rapid rewarming in 1982\u201385 found that 68% recovered without tissue loss, 25% experienced some tissue loss, and 7% needed ampu- tation. In a comparison group of 98 patients, treatment using older methods resulted in a tissue loss rate of nearly 35% and an amputation rate of nearly 33%. Although the comparison group included a higher proportion of sec- ond- and third-degree cases, the difference in treatment results was determined to be statistically significant. The extreme throbbing pain that many frostbite suf- ferers endure for days or weeks after rewarming is not the only prolonged symptom of frostbite. During the first weeks or months, people often experience tingling, a burning sensation, or a sensation resembling shocks from an electric current. Other possible consequences of frost- bite include skin\u2014color changes, nail deformation or loss, joint stiffness and pain, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and heightened sensitivity to cold. For every- one, a degree of sensory loss lasting at least four years\u2014 and sometimes a lifetime\u2014is inevitable. Prevention With the appropriate knowledge and precautions, frostbite can be prevented even in the coldest and most challenging environments. Appropriate clothing and footwear are essential. To prevent heat loss and keep the blood circulating properly, clothing should be worn loosely and in layers. Covering the hands, feet, and head is also crucial for preventing heat loss. Outer garments need to be wind and water resistant, and wet clothing and footwear must be replaced as quickly as possible. Alco- hol and drugs should be avoided because of their harmful effects on judgment and reasoning. Experts also warn against alcohol use and smoking in the cold because of the circulatory changes they produce. Paying close atten- tion to the weather report before venturing outdoors and avoiding unnecessary risks such as driving in isolated areas during a blizzard are also important.

          "content": "in order to heal. It is useful to be able to distinguish them by appearance as described above. A baby with a rash that does not clear up within two to three days or a rash with blisters or bleeding should be seen by a healthcare professional for further evaluation. Treatment Antibiotics are generally prescribed for rashes caused by bacteria, particularly impetigo. This may be a topical or oral formulation, depending on the size of the area involved and the severity of the infection. Over-the-counter antifungal creams, such as Lotrim- in, are often recommended to treat a rash resulting from yeast. If topical treatment is not effective, an oral antifun- gal may be prescribed. Mild steroid creams, such as 0.5\u20131% hydrocorti- sone, can be used for seborrheic dermatitis and some- times intertrigo. Prescription strength creams may be needed for short-term treatment of more stubborn cases. Alternative treatment Good diaper hygiene will prevent or clear up many simple cases of diaper rash. Diapers should be checked very frequently and changed as soon as they are wet or soiled. Good air circulation is also important for healthy skin. Babies should have some time without wearing a diaper, and a waterproof pad can be used to protect the bed or other surface. Rubber pants, or other occlusive fab- rics, should not be used over the diaper area. Some cloth- like disposable diapers promote better air circulation than plastic-type diapers. It may be necessary for mothers to experiment with diaper types to see if the baby\u2019s skin reacts better to cloth or disposable ones. If disposable dia- pers are used, the baby\u2019s skin may react differently to var- ious brands. If the baby is wearing cloth diapers, they should be washed in a mild detergent and double rinsed. The diaper area should be cleaned with something mild, even plain water. Some wipes contain alcohol or chemicals that can be irritating for some babies. Plain water may be the best cleansing substance when there is a rash. Using warm water in a spray bottle (or giving a quick bath) and then lightly patting the skin dry can pro- duce less skin trauma than using wipes. In the event of suspected yeast, a tablespoon of cider vinegar can be added to a cup of warm water and used as a cleansing solution. This is dilute enough that it should not burn, but acidifies the skin pH enough to hamper the yeast growth. Barrier ointments can be valuable to treat rashes. Those that contain zinc oxide are especially effective. These creams and ointments protect already irritated skin from the additional insult of urine and stool, particularly if the baby has diarrhea . Cornstarch powder may be used on rashes that are moist, such as impetigo. Nutrition What the baby eats can make a difference in stool fre- quency and acidity. Typically, breast-fed babies will have fewer problems with rashes. When adding a new food to the diet, the baby should be observed closely to see whether rashes are produced around the baby\u2019s mouth or anus. If this occurs, the new food should be discontinued. Babies who are taking antibiotics are more likely to get rashes due to yeast. To help bring the good bacterial counts back to normal, Lactobacillus bifidus can be added to the diet. It is available in powder form from most health food stores. Herbal treatment Some herbal preparations can be useful for diaper rash. Calendula reduces inflammation, tightens tissues, and disinfects. It has been recommended for seborrheic dermatitis as well as for general inflammation of the skin. The ointment should be applied at each diaper change. Chickweed ointment can also be soothing for irritated skin and may be applied once or twice daily. Prognosis Treated appropriately, diaper rash will resolve fairly quickly if there is no underlying health problem or skin disease. Prevention Frequent diaper changes are important to keep the skin dry and healthy.

          "content": "Plantar fasciitis is caused by long periods on the feet, being overweight, and wearing shoes that do not support the foot well. Teachers, mail carriers, runners, and others who make heavy use of their feet are especial- ly likely to suffer from plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis results in moderate to disabling heel pain. If nine to twelve months of conservative treatment (reducing time on feet, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, arch supports) under the supervision of a doctor does not result in pain relief, a fasciotomy may be done. Fasciotomy removes a small portion of the fascia to relieve tension and pain. Connective tissue grows back into the cut space left by the cut, effectively lengthening the fascia. When a fasciotomy is performed on other parts of the body, it is usually done to relieve pressure from a compression injury to a limb. This type of injury often occurs during contact sports. The blood vessels of the limb are damaged. They swell and leak, causing inflammation. Fluid builds up in the area contained by the fascia. A fasciotomy is done to relieve this pres- sure and prevent tissue death. Similar injury occurs in high voltage electrical burns where deep tissue dam- age occurs. Precautions In the case of injury, fasciotomy is done on an emer- gency basis, and the outcome of the surgery depends largely on the general health of the patient. Plantar fas- ciotomies are appropriate for most people whose foot problems cannot be resolved in any other way. Description Fasciotomy in the limbs is usually done by a surgeon under general or regional anesthesia. An incision is made in the skin, and a small area of fascia is removed where it will best relieve pressure. Then the incision is closed. Plantar fasciotomy is an endoscopic (performed with the use of an endoscope) procedure. It is done by a foot specialist in a doctor\u2019s office or outpatient surgical clinic under local anesthesia and takes 20 minutes to one hour. The doctor makes two small incisions on either side of the heel. An endoscope is inserted in one to guide the doctor in where to cut. A tiny knife is inserted in the other. A portion of the fascia is cut from near the heel; then the incisions are closed. Preparation Little preparation is done before a fasciotomy. When the fasciotomy is related to burn injuries, the fluid and electrolyte status of the patient are constantly monitored. KEY TERMS Endoscope\u2014A tube that contains a tiny camera and light, that is inserted in the body to allow a doctor to see inside without making a large incision. Aftercare Aftercare depends on the reason for the fasciotomy. People who have endoscopic plantar fasciotomy can walk without pain almost immediately, return to wearing their regular shoes within three to five days, and return to normal activities within three weeks. Most will need to wear arch supports in their shoes. Risks In endoscopic plantar fasciotomy, the greatest risk is that the arch will drop slightly as a result of this surgery, causing other foot problems. Risks involved with other types of fasciotomy are those associated with the admin- istration of anesthesia and the development of blood clots. Normal results Fasciotomy in the limbs reduces pressure, thus reducing tissue death. Endoscopic plantar fasciotomy has a success rate of 90\u201395%.

          "content": "dose symptoms can include slowed breathing, very low blood pressure, stupor, coma,shock, and death. Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

          "content": "sophageal reflux) can cause coughing, especially when a person is lying down. A cough can also be a side-effect of medications that are administered via an inhaler. It can also be a side-effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are drugs used for treating high blood pressure. Diagnosis To determine the cause of a cough, a physician should take an exact medical history and perform an exam. Information regarding the duration of the cough, what other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi- ronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his or her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also help determine what type of infection, if any, may be involved. The doctor may even observe the sputum microscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and extent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculo- sis. If these actions are not enough to determine the cause of the cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be ordered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to inspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx. Treatment Treatment of a cough generally involves addressing the condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu- monia may require antibiotics , an asthma-induced cough may be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an antihistamine may be administered in the case of an allergy. Physicians prefer not to suppress a productive cough, since it aids the body in clearing respiratory sys- tem of infective agents and irritants. However, cough KEY TERMS Antitussives\u2014Drugs used to suppress coughing. Expectorant\u2014Drug used to thin mucus. Gastroesophageal reflux \u2014Condition in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Glottis\u2014The opening between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx. Larynx\u2014A part of the respiratory tract between the pharynx and the trachea, having walls of cartilage and muscle and containing the vocal cords. Sputum\u2014The mixture of mucus, irritants, and other substances expelled from the lungs by coughing. medicines may be given if the patient cannot rest because of the cough or if the cough is not productive, as is the case with most coughs associated with colds or flu. The two types of drugs used to treat coughs are antitussives and expectorants. Antitussives Antitussives are drugs that suppress a cough. Nar- cotics\u2014primarily codeine\u2014are used as antitussives and work by depressing the cough center in the brain. How- ever, they can cause such side effects as drowsiness, nau- sea, and constipation . Dextromethorphan, the primary ingredient in many over-the-counter cough remedies, also depresses the brain\u2019s cough center, but without the side effects associated with narcotics. Demulcents relieve coughing by coating irritated passageways. Expectorants Expectorants are drugs that make mucus easier to cough up by thinning it. Guaifenesin and terpin hydrate are the primary ingredients in most over-the-counter expectorants. However, some studies have shown that in acute infections, simply increasing fluid intake has the same thinning effect as taking expectorants. Alternative treatment Coughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections may be effectively treated with botanical and homeopathic therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be specific to the type of cough the patient has. Some combination over-the-counter herbal and homeopathic cough formulas can be very effective for cough relief. Lingering coughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a trained practitioner. Many health practitioners advise increasing fluids and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of loosen- ing chest congestion. Others recommend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home remedy for coughs caused by colds or flu. Various vitamins, such as vitamin C, may be helpful in preventing or treating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to coughs. Avoiding of mucous-producing foods can be effective in healing a cough condition. These mucous-producing foods can vary, based on individual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mucous-producing food for most people. Prognosis Because the majority of coughs are related to the common cold or influenza, most will end in seven to 21 days. The outcome of coughs due to a more serious under- lying disease depends on the pathology of that disease. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 942 Cough",

Streptococcus \u2014A bacteria that causes erysipelas and strep throat, as well as other infections. bacteria is responsible for such infections as strep throat, and infections of both surgical and other kinds of wounds in the skin. The infection occurs most often in young infants and the elderly. Causes and symptoms Erysipelas usually occurs rather abruptly. When the preceding infection was strep throat, the rash begins on the face. Occasionally, when the preceding infection was of a wound from an injury or operation, the rash will appear on an arm or leg. Classically, the usual presentation is a bright-red, butterfly-shaped rash appearing across the bridge of the nose and the cheeks. It is hot to the touch, painful, shiny, and swollen, with clearly defined margins. The edges of the rash are a raised ridge, hard to the touch. There may be fluid-filled bumps scattered along the area. The rash spreads rapidly. Some patients have swelling of the eye- lids, sometimes so severe that their eyes swell shut. The patient may have fever, chills, loss of energy, nausea and vomiting , and swollen, tender lymph nodes. In severe cases, walled-off areas of pus (abscesses) may develop beneath the skin. If left untreated, the strepto- coccal bacteria may begin circulating in the bloodstream (a condition called bacteremia ). A patient may then develop an overwhelming, systemic infection called sep- sis, with a high risk of death. Diagnosis The rash of erysipelas is very characteristic, raising the practitioner\u2019s suspicion towards that diagnosis, espe- cially when coupled with a history of recent strep infec- tion. Attempts to culture (grow) the bacteria from a sam- ple of the rash usually fail. When the bacteria are present in the blood, they may be grown in a laboratory, and identified under a microscope. Other laboratory tests involve reacting fluorescently-tagged antibodies with a sample of the patient\u2019s infected tissue. This type of test may be successful in positively identifying the strepto- coccal bacteria. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1225 Erysipelas",

In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last- ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn- drome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic- ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer appears to be the case. Precautions As in any blood test, standard precautions should be performed to prevent infection at the site where the blood is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally, the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the blood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and syringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres- sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped. Description These tests are more often performed in a consulting laboratory than at a physician\u2019s office or in a hospital laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the whole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can be detected against several components of the Epstein- Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif- ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages) of the virus\u2019 growth. At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus, antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six months only. This antibody, however, persists substan- tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti- body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV occurred in the past. Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA can be found. Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable amounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which might be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship very unlikely. Preparation The skin area from which the blood sample will be obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or iodine. Aftercare The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test. Usually, pressure is applied to the area for several moments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult to interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after waiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts of antibody detected between the two tests can be particu- larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis. Risks There are no risks over and above those of having blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are more expensive than many other blood tests but are usually covered by medical insurance. Normal results The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to determine whether the person has not had infection with EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current- ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or has had first time infection with EBV sometime in the past (more than six months ago). If one defines \u201cnormal\u201d results as either not having EBV in the past, and call that category one; or having had it in the past, and call that category two. Most young children below the age of five will fall into category one, while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into category two. The results for susceptibility are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative \u2022 antibody to EBNA = Negative The results for past infection are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative (90% of time) \u2022 antibody to VCA IgM = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA IgG = positive \u2022 antibody to EBNA = positive It is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus, like all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leave the body after the patient recovers from illness.

Purpose The test is primarily used to detect whether first time infection (called primary infection) with the Epstein-Barr virus is currently occurring, or has occurred within a short period of time. The pattern of the antibodies detect- ed can, however, tell if the person has never been infect- ed with the Epstein-Barr virus, or if the infection occurred in the more distant past. These tests are mostly utilized in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis when the more common diag- nostic test, the heterophile antibody, is negative, or in sit- uations where the infection is manifesting unusual symp- toms.

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS.

In the female, this canal lies between the vagina and clitoris; in the male, the urethra travels through the penis, opening at the tip. Purpose Consequences of a CMV infection can be devastating in a pregnant woman, a transplant patient, or a person with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Antibody screening helps control the infection risk for these groups. In a healthy, nonpregnant person, CMV infection is almost never serious. Symptoms, if present, are mild, often resembling infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus. Antibody screening distinguishes between these two infections. Description When first exposed to CMV , a person\u2019s immune sys- tem is triggered and quickly makes antibodies to fight the virus. Antibodies are special proteins designed to attack and destroy foreign material, in this case, the cytomega- lovirus. The test combines a person\u2019s serum with a substance to which CMV antibodies attach. This antibody-antigen complex is measured and the amount of original anti- body determined. If positive for antibodies, the serum is diluted, or titered, and the test repeated until the serum is so dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last dilu- tion that gives a positive result is the titer reported. A test positive for CMV antibodies means the per- son has been infected with the virus, either currently or in the past; it doesn\u2019t mean the person has lifetime immu- nity. After an infection, this virus, like all members of the herpes virus group, can stay hidden inside a person and cause infection if the person\u2019s immune system later weakens and antibody protection decreases. In fact, reac- tivation of such hidden (or latent) infection is not at all uncommon and usually occurs without symptoms. Transplant patients and people with weakened immune systems, including those with HIV , are vulnera- ble to infection from several routes, including from another person, from a donated organ or transfused blood, or from reactivation of a past infection. Before transplant, both the recipient and donor are usually tested for antibodies. A recipient who has never had CMV (neg- ative for antibodies), should not receive an organ from a donor who has had CMV (positive for antibodies). CVM infection can be associated with organ rejection, or can cause illness such as pneumonia , hepatitis, or death. Similarly, blood is usually screened for CMV antibodies before being transfused into a person with a weakened immune system. CMV infection is the most common congenital infection (existing at birth). The infection, passed from mother to baby, can cause permanent mental or physical damage, or death.

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrocardiography Definition Electrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva- sive procedure for recording electrical changes in the heart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate to the electrical impulses which occur during each beat of the heart. The results are printed on paper or displayed on a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P, Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num- ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present. Purpose Electrocardiography is a starting point for detecting many cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physical examinations and for monitoring the patient\u2019s condition during and after surgery, as well as during intensive care. It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Precautions No special precautions are required. Description The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec- trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif- ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the electrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be employed. Muscle movement may interfere with the recording, which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases where rhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, the patient may wear a small Holter monitor in order to record continuously over a 24-hour period; this is known as ambulatory monitoring. Preparation The skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact at the electrode positions. Aftercare To avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to obtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor- oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes.

          "content": "triggered by an electrical impulse. These electrical impulses travel through specialized cells that form a con- duction system. Following this pathway ensures that con- tractions will occur in a coordinated manner. When the presence of all waves is observed in the electrocardiogram and these waves follow the order defined alphabetically, the heart is said to show a normal sinus rhythm, and impulses may be assumed to be fol- lowing the regular conduction pathway. The heart is described as showing arrhythmia or dys- rhythmia when time intervals between waves, the order, or the number of waves do not fit this pattern. Other fea- tures that may be altered include the direction of wave deflection and wave widths. In the normal heart, electrical impulses\u2014at a rate of 60\u2013100 times per minute\u2014originate in the sinus node. The sinus node is located in the first chamber, known as the right atrium, where blood re-enters the heart. After traveling down to the junction between the upper and lower chambers, the signal stimulates the atrioventricular node. From here, after a delay, it passes by specialized routes through the lower chambers or ventricles. In many disease states, the passage of the electrical impulse can be interrupted in a variety of ways, causing the heart to perform less efficiently. Abnormal results Special training is required for interpretation of the electrocardiogram. To summarize the features used in inter- pretations in the simplest manner, the P wave of the electro- cardiogram is associated with the contraction of the atria. The QRS series of waves, or QRS complex, is associated with ventricular contraction, with the T wave coming after the contraction. Finally, the P-Q or P-R interval gives a value for the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricle (normally less than 0.2 sec). The cause of dysrhythmia is ectopic beats. Ectopic beats are premature heart beats that arise from a site other than the sinus node\u2014commonly from the atria, atrioventricular node, or the ventricle. When these dys- rhythmias are only occasional, they may produce no symptoms, or a feeling of the heart turning over or \u201cflip- flopping\u201d may be experienced. These occasional dys- rhythmias are common in healthy people, but they also can be an indication of heart disease. The varied sources of dysrhythmias provide a wide range of alterations in the form of the electrocardiogram. Ectopic beats that start in the ventricle display an abnor- mal QRS complex. This can indicate disease associated with insufficient blood supply to the muscle (myocardial ischemia). Multiple ectopic sites lead to rapid and unco- ordinated contractions of the atria or ventricles. This con- dition is known as fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, P waves are absent, and the QRS complex appears at errat- ic intervals, or \u201cirregularly irregular.\u201d When the atrial impulse fails to reach the ventricle, a condition known as heart block results. If this is partial, the P-R interval (the time for the impulse to reach the ven- tricle) is prolonged. If complete, the ventricles beat inde- pendently of the atria at about 40 beats per minute, and the QRS complex is mostly dissociated from the P wave. Resources BOOKS Atwood, Sandra, et al.

          "content": "cy or shortly after a woman gives birth. This type of con- gestive cardiomyopathy is called peripartum cardiomy- opathy. The cause of congestive cardiomyopathy in preg- nancy is not known. Congestive cardiomyopathy usually is a chronic condition, developing gradually over time. Patients with early congestive cardiomyopathy may not have symp- toms. The most common symptoms are fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion. Unfortunately, sudden cardiac death is not uncommon with this condition. It stems from irregular heart rhythms in the ventricles (ven- tricular arrhythmias). Patients with more advanced congestive cardiomy- opathy may also have chest or abdominal pains, extreme tiredness, dizziness, and swelling of the legs and ankles. Diagnosis Diagnosis of congestive cardiomyopathy is based on: \u2022 symptoms \u2022 medical history \u2022 physical examination \u2022 chest x ray \u2022 electrocardiogram (ECG; also called EKG) \u2022 echocardiogram \u2022 cardiac catheterization The diagnosis is based on the patient\u2019s symptoms, a complete physical examination, and tests that detect abnormalities of the heart chambers. The physician lis- tens to the heart with a stethoscope to detect abnormal heart rhythms and heart sounds. A heart murmur might mean that the heart valves are not closing properly due to the ventricles being enlarged. A chest x ray can show if the heart is enlarged and if there is fluid in the lungs. Abnormalities of heart valves and other structures may also be seen on a chest x ray. An electrocardiogram provides a record of electrical changes in the heart muscle during the heartbeat. It gives information on the heart rhythm and can show if the heart chamber is enlarged. An ECG can detect damage to the heart muscle and the amount of damage. Echocardiography uses sound waves to make images of the heart. These images can show if the heart wall or chambers are enlarged and if there are any abnor- malities of the heart valves. Echocardiography can also evaluate the pumping efficiency of the ventricles. Cardiac catheterization usually is only used if a diagnosis cannot be made with other methods. In cardiac catheterization, a small tube (called a catheter) is inserted into an artery and passed into the heart. It is used to mea- sure pressure in the heart and the amount of blood pumped by the heart. A small tissue sample of the heart muscle can be removed through the catheter for examina- tion under a microscope (biopsy). This biopsy can show the type and amount of damage to the heart muscle. Treatment When a patient is diagnosed with congestive car- diomyopathy, physicians try to find out the cause. If coronary artery disease is not the culprit, in most other cases a cause is not identified. When a condition respon- sible for the congestive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying condi- tion. Congestive cardiomyopathy caused by drinking excess alcohol or by drugs or toxins can be treated by eliminating the alcohol or toxin completely. In some cases, the heart may recover after the toxic substance is removed from the body. Bacterial myocarditis is treated with an antibiotic to eliminate the bacteria. There is no cure for idiopathic congestive cardiomy- opathy. Medicines are given to reduce the workload of the heart and to relieve the symptoms. One or more of the following types of medicines may be prescribed for congestive cardiomyopathy: \u2022 digitalis \u2022 diuretics \u2022 vasodilators \u2022 beta blockers \u2022 angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhib- itors) \u2022 angiotensin receptor blockers Digitalis helps the heart muscle to have stronger pumping action. Diuretics help eliminate excess salt and water from the kidneys by making patients urinate more often. This helps reduce the swelling caused by fluid buildup in the tissues. Vasodilators, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and expand the blood vessels so blood can move more easily through them. This action makes it easier for the heart to pump blood through the vessels. Patients may also be given anticoagulant medica- tions to prevent clots from forming due to pooling of blood in the heart chambers. Medicines to prevent abnor- mal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) may be given, but some of these drugs can also reduce the force of heart contrac- tions. Automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICDs) can treat life-threatening arrhythmias, which are relatively common in severe cardiomyopathy.

The word ectopic means \u201cin an abnormal place or position.\u201d The most common site is the fallopian tube, the tube that nor- mally carries eggs from the ovary to the uterus. However, ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the ovary, the abdomen, and the cervical canal (the opening from the uterus to the vaginal canal). The phrases tubal pregnancy, ovarian preg- nancy, cervical pregnancy, and abdominal pregnancy refer to the specific area of an ectopic pregnancy. Description Once a month, an egg is produced in a woman\u2019s ovary and travels down the fallopian tube where it meets the male\u2019s sperm and is fertilized. In a normal pregnancy the fertilized egg, or zygote, continues on its passage down the fallopian tube and enters the uterus in three to five days. The zygote continues to grow, implanting itself securely in the wall of the uterus.

Purpose Irregular heartbeats can occur in healthy people without causing any dangerous symptoms or requiring medical attention. Slight changes in the normal patterns of heartbeats often reset themselves without notice. But when the heartbeat is greatly disrupted\u2014either because of traumatic injury, disease, hypertension , surgery, or reduced blood flow to the heart caused by blockages in the blood vessels that nourish the heart\u2014 the condition must be recognized and treated immediate- ly. Otherwise, it can be fatal. Various drugs can be used to control and help reset these abnormal heart rhythms ( arrhythmias). The tech- nique of catheter ablation (meaning tube-guided removal) is used to interrupt the abnormal contractions in the heart, allowing normal heart beating to resume. Atrial fibrilla- tion and flutter and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are two of the most common disorders treated with catheter ablation. Precautions The improper correction of abnormal heartbeats can cause additional arrhythmias and can be fatal. Abnormali- ties in different areas of the heart cause different types of irregular heartbeats; the type of arrhythmia must be clear- ly defined before this procedure can be properly done.

Located in the neck just below the angle of the jaw, the carotid sinus sits above the point where the carotid artery divides into its two main branch- es. Rubbing the carotid sinus stimulates an area in the artery wall that contains nerve endings. These nerves respond to changes in blood pressure and are capable of slowing the heart rate.

A number of other illnesses have been attributed to enteroviruses, including pneumonia and other respirato- ry infections, myositis or muscle inflammation, arthritis, and acute inflammation of the kidneys. It is clear then that these viruses produce a number of various illnesses, most often in younger age groups. Diagnosis In the majority of cases, diagnosis is based on the characteristic symptoms that the virus produces (such as the chest pain in pleurodynia). Rarely is it necessary to identify a specific strain of virus causing the illness. It is more important to be certain that the infection is due to a virus which does not require treatment with antibiotics. Culture, or growing the organism outside of the body, is helpful only when obtained from areas that tend to indi- cate recent infection, such as from swollen joints, cere- brospinal fluid, or blood. Cultures from other areas, such as the throat, can be misleading. This is because the virus may remain for long periods of time in places with a large amount of lymphatic tissue. As a rule, cultures done early in the illness are more likely to identify the virus. New techniques that involve identification of viral genetic material (PCR) are useful in certain cases, but are not indicated for routine testing. Treatment As noted above, enterovirus is capable of attacking many different organs and producing a variety of symp- toms. Most infections are mild and improve without complications, and require no specific therapy. When the virus attacks critical organs however, such as the heart, respiratory muscles, nervous system, etc., then special- ized care is often needed. As of 2001, no effective antiviral medication for enterovirus has undergone investigation in patients, though some drugs appear promising for the future. In some patients who are unable to produce antibodies (hypogammaglobunemia), administrating antibodies themselves is helpful. Prognosis The overall outlook for enterovirus infection depends on the organs involved, and the immune condi- tion of the individual patient. Unless vital organs are involved or immunity is abnormal, infection causes few problems.

Prevention In the hospital setting, the best means of avoiding transmission of infection is the use of good hand-wash- ing practices and other appropriate precautions (gowns and gloves for hospital staff). The virus is found in feces for up to one week after infection; therefore precautions that isolate waste material (enteric precautions) will help decrease the chance of spreading the illness.

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries.

Dorothy Elinor Stonely Carpal tunnel syndrome Definition Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disorder caused by compression at the wrist of the median nerve supplying the hand, causing numbness and tingling. Description The carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the bones and ligaments create a small passageway for the median nerve. The median nerve is responsible for both sensation and movement in the hand, in particular the thumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve is compressed, an individual\u2019s hand will feel as if it has \u201cgone to sleep.\u201d Women between the ages of 30 and 60 have the highest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research has demonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very sig- nificant cause of missed work days due to pain. In 1995, about $270 million was spent on sick days taken for pain from repetitive motion injuries. Causes and symptoms Compression of the median nerve in the wrist can occur during a number of different conditions, particular- ly those conditions which lead to changes in fluid accu- mulation throughout the body. Because the area of the wrist through which the median nerve passes is very nar- row, any swelling in the area will lead to pressure on the median nerve. This pressure will ultimately interfere with the nerve\u2019s ability to function normally. Pregnancy, obesity , arthritis, certain thyroid conditions, diabetes, and certain pituitary abnormalities all predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome.

A folding IOL is used when phacoemulsification is performed to accom- modate the small incision. Antibiotic drops to prevent infection and steroids to reduce inflammation are prescribed after surgery. An eye shield or glasses during the day will protect the eye from injury while it heals. During the night, an eye shield is worn. The patient returns to the doctor the day after surgery for assessment, with several follow-up visits over the next two months to monitor the healing process. Prognosis The success rate of cataract extraction is very high, with a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40 or better may be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract extraction was performed, a secondary cataract may develop in the remaining back portion of the capsule. This can occur one to two years after surgery. Y AG capsulotomy is most often used for this type of cataract. Y AG stands for yttrium alu- minum garnet, the name of the laser used for this proce- dure. This is a painless outpatient procedure and requires no incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in the remaining back part of the capsule, allowing light through. In a very small percentage (3\u20135%) of surgical cataract extractions, complications occur. Infections, swelling of the cornea (edema), bleeding, retinal detachment , and the onset of glaucoma have been reported. Some problems may occur one to two days, or even several weeks, after surgery. Any haziness, redness, decrease in vision, nausea, or pain should be reported to the surgeon immediately. Prevention Preventive measures emphasize protecting the eyes from UV radiation by wearing glasses with a special coating to protect against UV rays. Dark lenses alone are not suffi- cient. The lenses must protect against UV light (specifically, UV-A and UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some pro- tection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens pro- teins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants, includ- ing citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green leafy vegeta- bles, and/or vitamin supplements may be helpful. When tak- ing certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent eye exams may be necessary. Patients should speak to their doc- tors to see if medications may affect their eyes.

          "content": "There are several common symptoms of cataracts: \u2022 gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy vision \u2022 poor central vision \u2022 frequent changes in eyeglass prescription \u2022 changes in color vision \u2022 increased glare from lights, especially oncoming head- lights when driving at night \u2022 \u201csecond sight\u201d improvement in near vision (no longer needing reading glasses), but a decrease in distance vision \u2022 poor vision in sunlight \u2022 presence of a milky whiteness in the pupil as the cataract progresses. Diagnosis Both ophthalmologists and optometrists may detect and monitor cataract growth and prescribe prescription lenses for visual deficits. However, only an ophthalmolo- gist can perform cataract extraction. Cataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of symptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart, and by examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight into the pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of the lens even before visual symptoms have developed. An instrument called a slit lamp is basically a large micro- scope. This lets the doctor examine the front of the eye and the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor determine the location of the cataract. Some other diagnostic tests may be used to deter- mine if cataracts are present or how well the patient may potentially see after surgery. These include a glare test, potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test. Treatment For cataracts that cause no symptoms or only minor visual changes, no treatment may be necessary. Continued monitoring and assessment of the cataract is needed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist at scheduled office visits. Increased strength in prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses may be helpful. This may be all that is required if the cataract does not reduce the patient\u2019s quality of life. Cataract surgery\u2014the only option for patients whose cataracts interfere with vision to the extent of affecting their daily lives\u2014is the most frequently performed surgery in the United States. It generally improves vision in over 90% of patients. Some people have heard that a cataract should be \u201cripe\u201d before being removed. A \u201cripe\u201d or mature cataract is when the lens is completely opaque. Most cataracts are removed before they reach that stage. Some- times cataracts need to be removed so that the doctor can examine the back of the eye more carefully. This is impor- tant in patients with diseases that may affect the eye. If cataracts are present in both eyes, only one eye at a time should be operated on. Healing occurs in the first eye before the second cataract is removed, sometimes as early as the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is usu- ally given about four to six weeks after surgery. Patients will still need reading glasses. The overall health of the patient needs to be considered in making the decision to operate. However, age alone need not preclude effective surgical treatment of cataracts. People in their 90s can have successful return of vision after cataract surgery. Surgery to remove cataracts is generally an outpa- tient procedure. A local anesthetic is used and the proce- dure lasts about an hour. Removal of the cloudy lens can be done by several different procedures. The three types of cataract surgery available are: \u2022 Extracapsular cataract extraction. This type of cataract extraction is the most common. The lens and the front portion of the capsule are removed. The back part of the capsule remains, providing strength to the eye. \u2022 Intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens and the entire capsule are removed. This method carries an increased risk for detachment of the retina and swelling after surgery. It is rarely used. \u2022 Phacoemulsification. This type of extracapsular extrac- tion needs a very small incision, resulting in faster heal- ing. Ultrasonic vibration is applied to the lens to break it up into very small pieces which are then aspirated out of the eye with suction by the ophthalmologist. A replacement lens is usually inserted at the time of the surgery. A plastic artificial lens called an intraocular lens (IOL) is placed in the remaining posterior lens cap- sule of the eye.

Lorraine Lica, PhD Cataracts Definition A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally transparent crystalline lens of the eye. This cloudiness can cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventual blindness. Description The human eye has several parts. The outer layer of the eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped cornea and an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and sclera help protect the eye. The next layer includes the iris, pupil, and ciliary body. The iris is the colored part of the eye and the pupil is the small dark round hole in the middle of the iris. The pupil and iris allow light into the eye. The ciliary body contains muscles that help in the eye\u2019s focusing ability. The lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by a cellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent, elliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticity allows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. The lens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of Zinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules, which then change the shape of the lens. This process is called accommodation\u2014the lens focuses images to help make vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens and changes shape less easily. As a result, the accommodation process becomes more difficult, making it harder to see things up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40 and continues until about age 65. The condition is called presbyopia. It is a normal condition of aging, generally resulting in the need for reading glasses. The lens is made up of approximately 35% protein and 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes in the lens\u2019 proteins occur. Changes in the proteins, water content, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of the reasons for the formation of a cataract. The major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor- tex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of the lens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule is the outer layer. Opacities can occur in any area of the lens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to loca- tion (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular cataracts). The density and location of the cataract determines the amount of vision affected. If the cataract forms in the area of the lens directly behind the pupil, vision may be signif- icantly impaired. A cataract that occurs on the outer edges or side of the lens will create less of a visual problem. Cataracts in the elderly are so common that they are thought to be a normal part of the aging process. Between the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance of having a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 and older are affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senile or age-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes, with each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initial- ly, cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remains small or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changes may be minor. Cataracts that occur in people other than the elderly are much less common. Congenital cataracts occur very rarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection or disease in the mother during pregnancy are among the causes of congenital cataracts. Traumatic cataracts may develop after a foreign body or trauma injures the lens or eye. Systemic illnesses, such as diabetes, may result in cataracts. Cataracts can also occur secondary to other eye diseases\u2014for example, an inflammation of the inner layer of the eye (uveitis) or glaucoma. Such cataracts are called complicated cataracts. Toxic cataracts result from chemical toxicity, such as steroid use. Cataracts can also result from exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) rays. Causes and symptoms Recent studies have been conducted to try to deter- mine whether diet or the use of vitamins might have an effect on the formation of cataracts in older people. The results have been mixed, with some studies finding that there is a connection and other studies finding none. Much interest has been focused on the use of antioxidant supplements as a protection against cataracts. Antioxidant vitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and beta-carotene help the body clean-up oxygen-free radicals. Some vitamins are marketed specifically for the eyes. Patients should speak to their doctors about the use of such vitamins. Smoking and alcohol intake have been implicated in cataract formation. Some studies have determined that a diet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataract formation, while an increase in foods rich in antioxidants will reduce the incidence. More research is needed to determine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vita- mins have any connection to the formation of cataracts. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 673 Cataracts",

The optic nerve enters the back of the eye and can be checked for swelling or other problems. The blood vessels can be viewed as can the retina. The macula is a 3\u20135 mm area in the back of the eye and is responsible for central vision. The fovea is a small area located within the macula and is responsible for sharp vision.

A normal visual field extends about 60\u00b0 upward, about 75\u00b0 downward, about 65\u00b0 toward the nose, and about 100\u00b0 toward the ear and has one blind spot close to the center. Defects in the visual field signify damage to the retina, optic nerve, or the neurological visual pathway. Seeing clearly does not necessarily mean the eyes are healthy or that the eyes are working together as a team. Regular checkups can detect abnormalities, hope- fully before a problem arises. The eye doctor can suggest ways to help protect the eyes and vision (e.g., safety gog- gles, ultraviolet (UV) coatings on lenses). A person should also have an eye exam if they notice a change in vision, eyestrain, blur, flashes of light, a sudden onset of floaters (little dots), distortion of objects, double vision, redness, pain or discharge.

Lorraine Lica, PhD Eye exercises see Vision training Eye glasses and contact lenses Definition Eyeglasses and contact lenses are devices that cor- rect refractive errors in vision. Eyeglass lenses are mounted in frames worn on the face, sitting mostly on the ears and nose, so that the lenses are positioned in front of the eyes. Contact lenses appear to be worn in direct contact with the cornea, but they actually float on a layer of tears that separates them from the cornea. Purpose The purpose of eyeglasses and contact lenses is to correct or improve the vision of people with nearsighted- ness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), presbyopia, and astigmatism. Precautions People allergic to certain plastics should not wear contact lenses or eyeglass frames or lenses manufactured from that type of plastic. People allergic to nickel should not wear Flexon frames. People at risk of being in acci- dents that might shatter glass lenses should wear plastic lenses, preferably polycarbonate. (Lenses made from polycarbonate, the same type of plastic used for the space shuttle windshield, are about 50 times stronger than other lens materials.) Also, people at risk of receiv- ing electric shock should avoid metal frames. People employed in certain occupations may be pro- hibited from wearing contact lenses, or may be required to wear safety eyewear over the contact lenses. Some occupations, such as construction or auto repair, may require safety lenses and safety frames. Physicians and employers should be consulted for recommendations.

          "content": "glasses. The glasses are generally made by an optician. A separate contact lens-fitting exam is necessary if the patient wants contact lenses, because an eyeglass pre- scription is not the same as a contact lens prescription. Eyeglasses Over 140 million people in the United States wear eyeglasses. People whose eyes have refractive errors do not see clearly without glasses, because the light emitted from the objects they are observing does not come into focus on their retinas. For people who are farsighted, images come into focus behind the retina; for people who are nearsight- ed, images come into focus in front of the retina. LENSES. Lenses work by changing the direction of light so that images come into focus on the retina. The greater the index of refraction of the lens material and the greater the difference in the curvature between the two surfaces of the lens, the greater the change in direction of light that passes through it, and the greater the correction. Lenses can be unifocal, with one correction for all distances, or they can be correct for more than one dis- tance (multifocal). One type of multifocal, the bifocal, has an area of the lens (usually at the bottom) that cor- rects for nearby objects (about 14 in from the eyes); the remainder of the lens corrects for distant objects (about 20 ft from the eyes). Another type of multifocal, a trifo- cal, has an area in-between that corrects for intermedi- ate distances (usually about 28 in). Conventional bifo- cals and trifocals have visible lines between the areas of different correction; however, lenses where the correc- tion gradually changes from one area to the other, with- out visible lines, have been available since the 1970s. Such lenses are sometimes called progressives or no- line bifocals. To be suitable for eyeglass lenses, a material must be transparent, without bubbles, and have a high index of refraction. The greater the index of refraction, the thinner the lens can be. Lenses are made from either glass or plastic (hard resin). The advantage of plastic is that it is lightweight and more impact resistant than glass. The advantage of glass is that it is scratch resistant and pro- vides the clearest possible vision. Glass was the first material to be used for eyeglass lenses, and was used for several hundred years before plastic was introduced. The crown glass used for eye- glass lenses has an index of refraction of 1.52. Optical-quality acrylic was introduced for eyeglass use in the early 1940s, but because it was easily scratched, brittle, and discolored rapidly, it did not sup- plant glass as the material of choice. Furthermore, it had a relatively low index of refraction, so it wasn\u2019t suitable for people with large refractive errors. A plastic called CR-39, introduced in the 1960s, was more suitable. Today, eyeglass wearers can also choose between poly- carbonate, which is the most impact-resistant material available for eyewear, and polyurethane, which has exceptional optical qualities and an index of refraction of up to 1.66, much higher than the conventional plastics used for lenses, and even higher than glass. Patients with high prescriptions should ask about high index material options for their lenses. Aspheric lenses are also useful for high prescriptions. They are flatter and lighter than conventional lenses. There are many lenses and lens-coating options for individual needs, including coatings that block the ultra- violet (UV) light or UV and blue light which have been found to be harmful to the eyes. Such coatings are not needed on polycarbonate lenses, which already have UV protection. UV coatings are particularly important on sunglasses and ski goggles. Sunglasses, when nonpre- scription, should be labeled with an indication that they block out 99\u2013100% of both UV-A and UV-B rays. There are anti-scratch coatings that increase the surface hardness of lenses (an important feature when using plastic lenses) and anti-reflective (AR) coatings that eliminate almost all glare and allow other people to see the eyes of the wearer. AR coatings may be particu- larly helpful to people who use computers or who drive at night. Mirror coatings that prevent other people from seeing the wearer\u2019s eyes are also available. There is a whole spectrum of tints, from light tints to darker tints, used in sunglasses. Tint, however, does not block-out UV rays, so a UV coating is needed. Polaroid lenses that block out much of the reflected light also allow bet- ter vision in sunny weather and are helpful for people who enjoy boating. Photosensitive (photochromatic) lenses that darken in the presence of bright light are handy for people who don\u2019t want to carry an extra set of glasses. Photochromatic lenses are available in glass and plastic. FRAMES. Frames can be made from metal or plastic, and they can be rimless. There is an almost unlimited variety of shapes, colors, and sizes. The type and degree of refractive correction in the lens determine to some extent the type of frame most suitable. Some lenses are too thick to fit in metal rims, and some large-correction prescriptions are best suited to frames with small-area lenses. Rimless frames are the least noticeable type, and they are lightweight because the nosepiece and temples are attached directly to the lenses, eliminating the weight of the rims. They tend to not be as sturdy as frames with rims, so they are not a good choice for people who frequently GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1266 Eye glasses and contact lenses",

Howard Baker Cat-scratch fever see Cat-scratch disease Cataract surgery Definition Cataract surgery is a procedure performed to remove a cloudy lens from the eye; usually an intraocular lens is implanted at the same time. Purpose The purpose of cataract surgery is to restore clear vision. It is indicated when cloudy vision due to cataracts has progressed to such an extent that it inter- feres with normal daily activities. Precautions Cataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at once. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in the event of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye is allowed to heal before the cataract is removed from the second eye. The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye problems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctors nor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since such conditions will continue to impair sight after cataract removal if they are not identified and treated, the eventu- al outcome of cataract surgery will depend on the out- come of other problems. In 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery can contribute to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is the degeneration of the central part of the retina. According- ly, ARMD patients with cataracts must weigh the risks of the loss of central vision, within four or five years, against short-term improvement. When an ARMD patient chooses cataract surgery, the surgeon should shield the retina against bright light to protect it from possible light-induced damage during surgery and install an intraocular lens capable of absorbing ultraviolet and blue light, which seem to do the most damage. KEY TERMS Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) \u2014 Degeneration of the macula (the central part of the retina where the rods and cones are most dense) that leads to loss of central vision in people over 60. Cataract \u2014Progressive opacity or clouding of an eye lens, which obstructs the passage of light to the retina. Cornea\u2014Clear outer covering of the front of the eye. Intraocular lens\u2014Lens made of silicone or plastic placed within the eye; can be corrective. Retina\u2014Innermost layer at the back of the eye, which contains light receptors, the rods and cones. Description There are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular and extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the removal of both the lens and the thin capsule that surround them. This type of surgery was common before 1980, but has since been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removal of the capsule requires a large incision and doesn\u2019t allow comfortable intraocular lens implantation. Thus, people who undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have long recovery periods and have to wear very thick glasses. Extracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of the lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year in the United States, over a million cataracts are removed this way. There are two methods for extracapsular cataract surgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification. A tiny incision (about 0.12 in or 3 mm long) is made next to the cornea (the eye\u2019s outer covering), and an ultrasonic probe is used to break the cataract into minute pieces, which are then removed by suction. When the lens is too hard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will use a different extracapsular technique requiring a larger incision. An incision about 0.37 in (9 mm) long is made, and the whole lens (without its capsule) is removed through the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extrac- tion leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone or plastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in about the same location as the original lens. The surgery takes about 30\u201360 minutes per eye.

The patient will also have a pre-operative physical exam- ination. In addition, patients start a course of antibiotic eye drops or ointment the day before surgery. Aftercare Proper post-operative care is especially important after cataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive them home after the surgery and should not bend over or do any- thing strenuous for about two weeks. They should refrain from rubbing the eye, should wear glasses to protect their eye, and should wear a shield while sleeping so the eye won\u2019t be rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient will usually continue their antibiotic for two to three weeks and will also take anti-inflammatory medication for about the same length of time. If the patient experiences inflamma- tion, redness, or pain, they should seek immediate medical treatment to avoid serious complications. Risks Cataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the time, there are no complications. Possible complications include intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central retinal inflammation (macular edema), post-operative glaucoma, retinal detachment, bleeding under the reti- na (choroidal hemorrhage), and tiny lens fragments in the back (vitreous) cavity of the eye, all of which can lead to loss of sight. Normal results Ordinarily, patients experience improved visual acu- ity and improved perception of the vividness of colors, leading to increased abilities in many activities, including reading, needlework, driving, golf, and tennis, for exam- ple.

          "content": "Treatment Bowel obstruction requires a surgeon, sometimes immediately. Newer surgical techniques constantly improve the outcome, but obstruction is a mechanical problem that needs a mechanical solution. Most adults who come to surgery for obstruction have suffered for years from peptic ulcer disease. They will usually benefit from ulcer surgery at the same time their obstruction is relieved. The surgeon will therefore select a procedure that combines relief of obstruction with remedy for ulcer disease. There are many choices. In fact, even without obstruction, functional considerations require ulcer surgery to include enhancement of stomach emptying. To treat an infant with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, some surgeons have had success with forceful balloon dilation of the pylorus done through a gastroscope, but the standard procedure is to cut across the overdeveloped circular muscle that is constricting the stomach outlet. There are reports of infant hypertrophic pyloric stenosis remitting without surgery following a very careful feed- ing schedule, but mortality is unacceptably high. Prognosis A functioning and unrestricted intestine is a prereq- uisite for living independent of the most advanced and continuous medical care available. Achieving this desir- able goal is the rule with surgery for duodenal obstruc- tions of all types. The bowel is so malleable that there is a rearrangement to suit every occasion. The variety of possible configurations is limited only by the surgeon\u2019s imagination. Prevention Prompt and effective treatment of peptic ulcers will prevent chronic scarring and narrowing.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD Esophageal ulcers see Ulcers (digestive) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Definition An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterolo- gy (the medical study of the stomach and intestines) is a thin, flexible tube that uses a lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is limited to the examination of the inside of the gastrointestinal tract\u2019s upper portion, it is called upper endoscopy or esphagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). With the endoscope, the esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of the small intes- tine) can be easily examined, and abnormalities frequent- ly treated. Patients are usually sedated during the exam. Purpose EGD is performed to evaluate or treat symptoms relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as: \u2022 upper abdominal or chest pain \u2022 nausea or vomiting \u2022 difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) \u2022 bleeding from the upper intestinal tract \u2022 anemia (low blood count ). EGD can be used to treat certain conditions, such as an area of narrowing or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract Upper endoscopy is more accurate than x rays for detecting inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It is used to diagnose early cancer and can frequently determine whether a growth is benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Biopsies (small tissue samples) of inflamed or \u201csus- picious\u201d areas can be obtained and examined by a pathol- ogist. Cell scrapings can also be taken by the introduc- tion of a small brush; this helps in the diagnosis of cancer or infections. When treating conditions in the upper gastrointesti- nal tract, small instruments are passed through the endo- scope that can stretch narrowed areas (strictures), or remove swallowed objects (such as coins or pins). In addition, bleeding from ulcers or vessels can be treated by a number of endoscopic techniques. Recent studies have shown the usefulness of endo- scopic removal of early tumors of the esophagus or stom- ach. This is done either with injection of certain materi- als (like alcohol), or with the use of instruments (like lasers) that burn the tumor. Other techniques combining medications and lasers also show promise. Precautions Patients should inquire as to the doctor\u2019s expertise with these procedures, especially when therapy is the main goal. The doctor should be informed of any aller- gies, medication use, and medical problems. Description First, a \u201ctopical\u201d (local) medication to numb the gag reflex is given either by spray or is gargled. Patients are usually sedated for the procedure (though not always) by injection of medications into a vein. The endoscopist then has the patient swallow the scope, which is passed through the upper gastrointestinal tract. The lens or cam- era at the end of the instrument allows the endoscopist to examine each portion of the upper gastrointestinal tract; photos can be taken for reference. Air is pumped in through the instrument to allow proper observation. Biopsies and other procedures can be performed without any significant discomfort.

          "content": "Treatment Infants with esophageal atresia are unlikely to survive without surgery to reconnect the esophagus. The procedure is done as soon as possible; however, prematurity, the presence of other birth defects, or complications of apira- tion pneumonia may delay surgery. Once diagnosed, the baby will be fed intraveneously until he or she has recov- ered sufficiently from the operation. Mucus and saliva will also be continuously removed via a catheter until recovery has occured. When surgery is performed, the esophagus is reconnected and, if neccessary, separated from the trachea. If the two ends of the esophagus are too far apart to be reat- tached, tissue from the large intestine is used to join them. Prognosis Surgery to correct esophageal atresia is usually suc- cessful. Post-operative complications may include diffi- culty swallowing, since the esophagus may not contract efficiently, and gastrointestinal reflux, in which the acidic contents of stomach back up into the lower part of the esophagus, possibly causing ulcers.

Fistula\u2014Unnatural connection between two hol- low organs or one organ and the outside. along which food and liquid travel from the throat to the stomach. Description Esophageal cancer usually originates in the inner layers of the lining of the esophagus and grows outward. In time, the tumor can obstruct the passage of food and liquid, making swallowing painful and difficult. Since most patients are not diagnosed until the late stages of the disease, esophageal cancer is associated with poor quality of life and low survival rates. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of esophageal cancer, accounting for 95% of all esophageal cancers worldwide. The esophagus is nor- mally lined with thin, flat squamous cells that resemble tiny roof shingles. Squamous cell carcinoma can develop at any point along the esophagus but is most common in the middle portion. Adenocarcinoma has surpassed squamous cell carci- noma as the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United States. Adenocarcinoma originates in glandu- lar tissue not normally present in the lining of the esoph- agus. Before adenocarcinoma can develop, glandular cells must replace a section of squamous cells. This occurs in Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a precancerous condition in which chronic acid reflux from the stomach stimulates a transformation in cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus. A very small fraction of esophageal cancers are melanomas, sarcomas, or lymphomas. There is great variability in the incidence of esophageal cancer with regard to geography, ethnicity, and gender. The overall incidence is increasing. About 13,000 new cases of esophageal cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year. During the same 12-month period, 12,000 people die of this disease. It strikes between five and ten North Americans per 100,000. In some areas of China the cancer is endemic. Squamous cell carcinoma usually occurs in the sixth or seventh decade of life, with a greater incidence in African-Americans than in others. Adenocarcinoma develops earlier and is much more common in white patients. In general, esophageal cancer occurs more fre- quently in men than in women. Causes and symptoms The exact cause of esophageal cancer is unknown, although many investigators believe that chronic irrita- tion of the esophagus is a major culprit. Most of the iden- tified risk factors represent a form of chronic irritation. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1239 Esophageal cancer",

Ipecac syrup should not be given to patients who overdosed with tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, or any drug that causes a significant change in mental status. If a patient vomits while unconscious, there is a serious risk of choking. \u2022 Gastric lavage, or washing out the stomach, may be attempted. For this procedure a tube flexible tube is inserted through the nose, down the throat, and into the stomach. The contents of the stomach are then suc- tioned out through the tube. A solution of saline (salt water) is injected into the tube to rinse out the stomach. This solution is then suctioned out. This is the process used when someone has his/her stomach pumped. \u2022 Activated charcoal is sometimes given to absorb the drug. \u2022 Medication to stimulate urination or defecation may be given to try to flush the excess drug out of the body faster. \u2022 Intravenous (IV) fluids may be given. An intravenous line, a needle inserted into a vein, may be put into the arm or back of the hand. Fluids, either sterile saline (salt water solution) or dextrose (sugar water solution), can be administered through this line. Increasing fluids can help to flush the drug out of the system and to reestablish balance of fluids and minerals in the body. The pH (acid/base balance) of the body may need to be corrected by administering electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate through this IV line. If drugs need to be administered quickly, they can also be injected directly into the IV line. \u2022 Hemodialysis is a procedure where blood is circulated out of the body, pumped through a dialysis machine, then reintroduced back into the body.

An antidote is another drug that counteracts or blocks the overdose drug. For example, acetaminophen overdose can be treated with an oral medication, N-acetylcys- teine (Mucomyst), if the level of acetaminophen found in the blood is extremely high. Naloxone is an anti-nar- cotic drug that is given to counteract narcotic poison- ing. Nalmefen or methadone may also be used. \u2022 Psychiatric evaluation may be recommended if the drug overdose was taken deliberately. Prognosis While many victims of drug overdose recover with- out long term effects, there can be serious consequences. Some drug overdoses cause the failure of major organs like the kidneys or liver, or failure of whole systems like the respiratory or circulatory systems. Patients who sur- vive drug overdose may need kidney dialysis, kidney or liver transplant, or ongoing care as a result of heart fail- ure, stroke, or coma. Death can occur in almost any drug overdose situation, particularly if treatment is not started immediately. Prevention To protect children from accidental drug overdose, all medications should be stored in containers with child resistant caps. All drugs should be out of sight and out of reach of children, preferably in a locked cabinet. Pre- scription medications should be used according to direc- tions and only by the person whose name is on the label. Threats of suicide need to be taken seriously and appro- priate help sought for people with depression or other mental illness that may lead to suicide.

A loop colostomy is most often performed for creation of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured. Preparation As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be required to sign a consent form after the procedure is explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along with various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG), may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi- ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist, who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen for the stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy management. In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least the day before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid- night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations (GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte- ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec- tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery to remove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom- iting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, giving more space in the surgical field and decreasing chances of accidental injury. Aftercare Post-operative care for the patient with a new colos- tomy, as with those who have had any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia and the patient\u2019s reluctance to breathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the abdominal incision.

          "content": "Description The nasal septum is composed of two parts. Toward the back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, but further forward the bone becomes cartilage. With one finger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bent back and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis- placed to one side, it will impede the flow of air and mucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat- ed septum, can cause symptoms and disease. Causes and symptoms A deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor- mal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow- ing of the nasal passageway that it causes will threaten the drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which must pass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicine that when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus from the sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results. People with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater risk of obstruction because their nasal passageways are already narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them. The result is sinusitis, which can be acute and severe or chronic and lingering. Diagnosis It is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more difficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. It is common for a patient to complain that he/she can breathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis is easy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring, sleep apnea, and other breathing disorders. Treatment The definitive treatment is surgical repositioning of the septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixing it in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink the membranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista- mines, nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat- ments may also be temporarily beneficial. Alternative treatment As a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help- ful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent- ing drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hot peppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears and discharge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even more effective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often done using a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is poured into one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril. Then, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies are all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correct the problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflated balloon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a large enough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be an alternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in the nasospecific procedure is necessary. Prognosis Surgical repair is curative and carries little risk. Chronic infection can be painful and lead to complica- tions until it is resolved. If there is continued obstruction, the infection will very likely return. Prevention Avoidance of virus colds, airborne dusts, air pollu- tion, and known allergens will minimize the irritation and swelling of the membranes lining the nasal passages.

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

An endoscope is a thin flexible tube that uses a lens or mirror to look at various parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic retro- grade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can accu- rately determine the cause and site of blockage. It also has the advantage of being able to treat the cause of obstruction, by removing stones and dilating (stretching) strictures. ERCP involves the injection of x-ray dye into the bile ducts through an endoscope. Endoscopic ultra- sound is another endoscopic alternative, but is not as available as ERCP and is not therapeutic. Treatment The first aim is to control the bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually used. If the KEY TERMS Antibiotic\u2014A medication that is designed to kill or weaken bacteria. Bilirubin \u2014A pigment produced by the liver that is excreted in bile which causes a yellow discol- oration of the skin and eyes when it accumulates in those organs. Bilirubin levels can be measured by blood tests, and are most often elevated in patients with liver disease or a blockage to bile flow. Computed tomography scan (CT scan)\u2014A special- ized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections of the area in question can be examined in detail. In eval- uating the bile ducts, iodine-based dye is often injected intravenously. The procedure is of greatest value in diagnosing the complications of gallstones (such as abscesses, pancreatitis) rather than docu- menting the presence of a stone. Endoscope \u2014An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterology is a thin flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is performed to examine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pancreas, the organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirectly through the injection of x-ray dye into the bile duct. Endoscopy\u2014The performance of an exam using an endoscope is referred by the general term endoscopy. Diagnosis through biopsies or other means and therapeutic procedures can be done with these instruments. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)\u2014This is a technique that uses high-pressure waves similar to sound waves that can be \u201cfocused\u201d on a very small area, thereby fracturing small solid objects such as gallstones, kidney stones, etc. The small fragments can pass more easily and harmlessly into the intes- tine or can be dissolved with medications. Primary sclerosing cholangitis \u2014A chronic disease in which it is believed that the immune system fails to recognize the cells that compose the bile ducts as part of the same body, and attempts to destroy them. It is not clear what exactly causes the disease, but it is frequently associated with another inflam- matory disease of the digestive tract, ulcerative coli- tis. The inflammation of the ducts eventually pro- duces formation of scar tissue, causing multiple areas of narrowing (strictures) that block bile flow and lead to bacterial infection. Liver transplant gives the best chance for long-term survival. Ultrasound\u2014A non-invasive procedure based on changes in sound waves of a frequency that cannot be heard, but respond to changes in tissue composi- tion. It requires no preparation and no radiation occurs. It has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for diag- nosis of stones in the gallbladder, but is less accurate in diagnosing stones in the bile ducts. Gallstones as small as 2 mm can be identified. The procedure can now also be done through an endoscope, greatly improving investigation of the bile ducts. infection does not come under control promptly, as noted by decrease in fever and pain, then other methods to relieve the obstruction and infection will be needed. Either way, definitive treatment of the cause of bile duct infection is the next step, and this has undergone revolu- tionary changes in the past decade. Endoscopic, radi- ographic and other techniques have made it possible to successfully remove stones and dilate strictures that pre- viously required surgical intervention, often with high morbidity and mortality.

It is the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal- lons of water through it with the use of special equipment. It is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not just the lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact- ed fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites that often build up over the passage of time. It is a procedure that should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner. Purpose Anyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping pains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list of bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable bowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic- ular, cancer patients are often advised to undertake a course of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part of their treatment. When a biological cancer therapy begins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerous mass, it is essential that speedy and effective elimination of the resulting toxins is achieved. Colon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and alternative practitioners insist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce- dures. Providing that care is taken to replace the natural organisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefits can be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter- native practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowel is the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it clean will be an effective protection against this. Removing large amounts of toxic matter relieves the patient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms such as arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis, and a host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga- tion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug- gish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapy treatments over time. In addition, removing the layer of fecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu- als allows improved assimilation of the nutrients from foods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and other nutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition- ers consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel to be essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Description Origins Cleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy is not a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have been used successfully for decades to relieve chronic toxicity and even acute cases of toxemia. Over time, many people develop a thick layer of fecal matter that coats their colon. It hardens and becomes impacted, reducing the efficiency of the bowel, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 854 Colonic irrigation",

Patients with a history of bleeding disorder should con- sult with their treating physician before the test. If a mus- cle biopsy is planned as part of the diagnostic work-up, EMG should not be performed at the same site, as it may effect the microscopic appearance of the muscle. Description During an EMG test, a fine needle is inserted into the muscle to be tested. This may cause some discomfort, similar to that of an injection. Recordings are made while the muscle is at rest, and then during the contraction. The person performing the test may move the limb being test- ed, and direct the patient to move it with various levels of force. The needle may be repositioned in the same mus- cle for further recording. Other muscles may be tested as well. A typical session lasts from 30\u201360 minutes. A slightly different test, the nerve conduction veloci- ty test, is often performed at the same time with the same equipment. In this test, stimulating and recording elec- trodes are used, and small electrical shocks are applied to measure the ability of the nerve to conduct electrical sig- nals. This test may cause mild tingling and discomfort KEY TERMS Motor neurons\u2014Nerve cells that transmit signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscles. Motor unit action potentials \u2014Spikes of electrical activity recorded during an EMG that reflect the number of motor units (motor neurons and the muscle fibers they transmit signals to) activated when the patient voluntarily contracts a muscle. similar to a mild shock from static electricity. Evoked potentials may also be performed for additional diagnos- tic information. Nerve conduction velocity and evoked potential testing are especially helpful when pain or sen- sory complaints are more prominent than weakness. Preparation No special preparation is needed. The doctor super- vising and interpreting the test should be given informa- tion about the symptoms, medical conditions, suspected diagnosis, neuroimaging studies, and other test results. Aftercare Minor pain and bleeding may continue for several hours after the test. The muscle may be tender for a day or two. Risks There are no significant risks to this test, other than those associated with any needle insertion (pain, bleed- ing, bruising, or infection). Normal results There should be some brief EMG activity during needle insertion. This activity may be increased in dis- eases of the nerve and decreased in long-standing muscle disorders where muscle tissue is replaced by fibrous tis- sue or fat. Muscle tissue normally shows no EMG activi- ty when at rest or when moved passively by the examin- er. When the patient actively contracts the muscle, spikes (motor unit action potentials) should appear on the recording screen, reflecting the electrical activity within. As the muscle is contracted more forcefully, more groups of muscle fibers are recruited or activated, causing more EMG activity. Abnormal results The interpretation of EMG results is not a simple matter, requiring analysis of the onset, duration, ampli- tude, and other characteristics of the spike patterns. Electrical activity at rest is abnormal; the particular pattern of firing may indicate denervation (for example, a nerve lesion, radiculopathy, or lower motor neuron degeneration), myotonia, or inflammatory myopathy. Decreases in the amplitude and duration of spikes are associated with muscle diseases, which also show faster recruitment of other muscle fibers to compensate for weakness. Recruitment is reduced in nerve disorders. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1160 Electromyography",

          "content": "External sphincter electromyography Definition External sphincter electromyography helps physi- cians determine how well the external urinary sphincter muscle is working by measuring the electrical activity in it during contraction and relaxation. Purpose The external sphincter muscle is the ring-like muscle that controls urine release from the bladder. When a patient cannot voluntarily control urination (inconti- nence), a physician may order this test to determine if the problem is caused by the failure of this muscle. The vol- untary contraction or release of a muscle such as the external sphincter involves a complex process in which the nerves controlling the muscle signal it to move through the release and uptake of chemicals called neu- rotransmitters and the generation of electrical impulses. This test records the electrical impulses given off when the muscle contracts or relaxes and allows the physician to determine if the muscle is working properly, if it has been damaged by disease, or some other condition. Precautions Patients who are taking muscle relaxants or drugs that act like or have an effect on the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (cholinergic or anti-cholinergic drugs) should tell the doctor since they will change the test results. The results will also be altered if the patient moves during the test or if the electrodes are improperly placed. Description The patient puts on a surgical gown and lies down on the examining table. The procedure, which takes between 30\u201360 minutes, may be conducted one of three ways: \u2022 Skin electrodes. This is the most commonly used method of recording information. The skin where the electrodes will be placed is cleaned and shaved and an electrically conductive paste is applied. The electrodes are then taped in place. For female patients, the electrodes are taped around the urethra, while for male patients they are placed between the scrotum and the anus. \u2022 Needle electrodes. This is considered the most accurate method, since the electrodes are inserted directly into the muscle, using needles to guide placement. For male patients, a gloved finger is inserted in the rectum, then needles with wires attached are inserted through the skin between the anus and the scrotum. For female KEY TERMS Anti-cholinergic drug \u2014A medication that blocks or subdues the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

The discomfort of placing the needles is about the same as that of an injection. The needles are withdrawn, and the wires are taped to the thigh. \u2022 Anal plug electrodes. The tip of an anal plug is lubricat- ed and inserted into the rectum as the patient relaxes the anal sphincter. Electrodes are attached to the anal plug. Once the electrodes are in place and attached to the recording device, the patient is asked to alternately con- tract and relax the external sphincter muscle. The electri- cal activity generated during these contractions and relax- ations is recorded on a graph called an electromyogram. Preparation Before the test, the patient should discuss with the doctor whether it is necessary to temporarily discontinue any medications, and follow the doctor\u2019s orders. No changes in diet or activity are necessary. Aftercare Women may see some blood in their urine the first time they urinate after the test. Blood in the urine of men or blood in the urine of women after the first urination should be reported the doctor. The patient should take a warm bath and drink plenty of fluids to ease any discomfort after the test. Risks Complications of external sphincter electromyogra- phy are rare. Occasionally patients report blood in their urine after being tested with needle electrodes. Also, the urethra may become mildly irritated causing a change in the normal frequency of urination.

          "content": "inability to feel if something is hot or cold. Most people with CMT remain able to walk throughout their lives. Diagnosis Diagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological exam to determine the extent and distribution of weakness. A thorough family history should be taken at this time to deter- mine if other people in the family are affected. Testing may also be performed to rule out other causes of neuropathy. A nerve conduction velocity test should be per- formed to measure how fast impulses travel through the nerves. This test may show characteristic features of CMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conduction testing may be combined with electromyography (EMG), an electrical test of the muscles. A nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the nerve) may be performed to look for changes characteris- tic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic of CMT and is usually not necessary for making a diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genet- ic testing, usually performed by drawing a small amount of blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to detect mutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2. However, research is progressing rapidly and new testing is often made available every few months. All affected members of a family have the same type of CMT. Therefore once a mutation is found in one affected member, it is possible to test other members who may have symptoms or are at risk of developing CMT. Prenatal diagnosis Testing during pregnancy to determine whether an unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing in a family has identified a specific CMT-causing mutation. This can be done after 10\u201312 weeks of pregnancy using a procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS involves removing a tiny piece of the placenta and exam- ining the cells. Testing can also be done by amniocente- sis after 16 weeks gestation by removing a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing the cells in the fluid. Each of these procedures has a small risk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are interested in learning more should check with their doctor or genetic counselor. Couples interested in these options should obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore all of the benefits and limitations of these procedures. Treatment There is no cure for CMT. However, physical and occupational therapy are an important part of CMT treat- ment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range of motion and minimize deformity caused by muscle shortening, or contracture. Braces are sometimes used to improve control of the lower extremities that can help tremendously with balance. After wearing braces, people often find that they have more energy because they are using less energy to focus on their walking. Occupational therapy is used to provide devices and techniques that can assist tasks such as dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities of daily life. V oice-activated software can also help people who have problems with fine motor control. It is very important that people with CMT avoid injury that causes them to be immobile for long periods of time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to return to their original strength after injury. There is a long list of medications that should be avoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT such as hydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B6, and D, Taxol, and large intravenous doses of penicillin. Com- plete lists are available from the CMT support groups. Peo- ple considering taking any of these medications should weigh the risks and benefits with their physician. Prognosis The symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly over many years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy. The majority of people with CMT do not need to use a wheelchair during their lifetime. Most people with CMT are able to lead full and productive lives despite their physical challenges.

          "content": "Electrolyte tests Definition Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged molecules, called ions, that are found within cells, between cells, in the bloodstream, and in other fluids throughout the body. Electrolytes with a positive charge include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; the negative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. The concentrations of these ions in the bloodstream remain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthy person. Changes in the concentration of one or more of these ions can occur during various acute and chronic disease states and can lead to serious consequences. Purpose Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes are useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues for the diagnosis of specific diseases. Electrolyte tests are used for diagnosing dietary deficiencies, excess loss of nutrients due to urination, vomiting, and diarrhea ,o r abnormal shifts in the location of an electrolyte within the body. When an abnormal electrolyte value is detect- ed, the physician may either act to immediately correct the imbalance directly (in the case of an emergency) or run further tests to determine the underlying cause of the abnormal electrolyte value. Electrolyte disturbances can occur with malfunctioning of the kidney (renal failure), infections that produce severe and continual diarrhea or vomiting, drugs that cause loss of electrolytes in the urine (diuretics), poisoning due to accidental consump- tion of electrolytes, or diseases involving hormones that regulate electrolyte concentrations. Precautions Electrolyte tests are performed from routine blood tests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairly uniform throughout the United States. During the prepa- ration of blood plasma or serum, health workers must take care not to break the red blood cells, especially when testing for serum potassium. Because the concen- tration of potassium within red blood cells is much high- er than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cells would cause falsely elevated potassium levels. Description Electrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood plasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytes can be classified in at least five different ways. One way is that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells, or are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells, or are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne- sium occur at much greater levels inside the cell than outside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greater levels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish- es those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans- mission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium, potassium, and calcium are the important electrolytes involved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting them are most closely associated with neurological disorders. A third classification focuses on electrolytes that are able to form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal- cium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to form complexes with each other. Disorders that cause an increase in either plasma calcium or phosphate can result in the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the soft tissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns those electrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of the bloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood- stream is normally in the range of 7.35\u20137.45. A decrease below this range is called acidosis, while a pH above this range is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closely associated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon- ate, chloride, and phosphate. Preparation All electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or serum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam- ple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical that prevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum is prepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in a test tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneously clots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from a vein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with a centrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot. Normal results Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea- sured in serum or plasma. Values can be expressed in terms of weight per unit volume (mg/deciliter; mg/dL) or in the number of molecules in a volume, or molarity (moles or millimoles/liter; M or mM). The range of nor- mal values sometimes varies slightly between different age groups, for males and females, and between different analytical laboratories. The normal level of serum sodium is in the range of 136\u2013145 mM. The normal levels of serum potassium are 3.5\u20135.0 mM. Note that sodium occurs at a much higher concentration than potassium. The normal concentration of total serum calcium (bound calcium plus free calcium) is in the range of 8.8\u201310.4 mg/dL. About 40% of the total calcium in the plasma is loosely bound to proteins; this GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1157 Electrolyte tests",

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrocardiography Definition Electrocardiography is a commonly used, non-inva- sive procedure for recording electrical changes in the heart. The record, which is called an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), shows the series of waves that relate to the electrical impulses which occur during each beat of the heart. The results are printed on paper or displayed on a monitor. The waves in a normal record are named P, Q, R, S, and T and follow in alphabetical order. The num- ber of waves may vary, and other waves may be present. Purpose Electrocardiography is a starting point for detecting many cardiac problems. It is used routinely in physical examinations and for monitoring the patient\u2019s condition during and after surgery, as well as during intensive care. It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Precautions No special precautions are required. Description The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec- trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif- ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the electrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be employed. Muscle movement may interfere with the recording, which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases where rhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, the patient may wear a small Holter monitor in order to record continuously over a 24-hour period; this is known as ambulatory monitoring. Preparation The skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact at the electrode positions. Aftercare To avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to obtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor- oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes.

Barstow, RN Electrocution see Electric shock injuries Electroencephalography Definition Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a neurological test that uses an electronic monitoring device to measure and record electrical activity in the brain. Purpose The EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage- ment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also used to assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g., stroke, tumors, encephalitis), mental retardation, sleep disorders, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s dis- ease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and certain mental disor- ders (e.g.,alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism). An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity during surgery and to determine brain death. Precautions Electroencephalography should be administered and interpreted by a trained medical professional only. Data from an EEG is only one element of a complete medical and/or psychological patient assessment, and should never be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis. Description Before the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach- es approximately 16\u201320 electrodes to the patient\u2019s scalp with a conductive, washable paste. Depending on the purpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodes are occasionally used. Implantable electrodes include sphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires inserted under the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec- trodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain. The EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea- sure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain. For the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table, or comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain still during the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes no more than one hour. During the test procedure, the patient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visual stimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board may be used to stimulate certain types of brain activity. Throughout the procedure, the electroencephalograph machine makes a continuous graphic record of the patient\u2019s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip of recording paper or on a computer screen. This graphic record is called an electroencephalogram. The sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce- dures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG are encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than just relax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet room conducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours. In an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a portable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor- mal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for a period of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patient and patient\u2019s family record any symptoms or abnormal behaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG to see if they represent seizures. Many insurance plans provide reimbursement for EEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to more than $500, depending on the purpose and type of test (i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec- trodes).

Purpose Nerves convey information to the body by sending electrical signals down the length of the nerve. These sig- nals can be recorded by wires placed over the nerves on the surface of the skin, in a procedure called an evoked potential (EP) study. The person conducting the test evokes the patient\u2019s neural activity by visual or auditory stimulation or using a mild electrical shock. This causes changes in the electrical potential in the nerves. Analysis of the signals can provide information about the condi- tion of nerve pathways, especially those in the brain and spinal cord. They can indicate the presence of disease or degeneration, and can help determine the location of nerve lesions. There are three major types of EP studies used regu- larly: \u2022 Visual evoked potentials are used to diagnose visual losses due to optic nerve damage, especially from mul- tiple sclerosis . They are also useful to diagnose \u201chys- terical blindness,\u201d in which loss of vision is not due to any nerve damage. \u2022 Auditory evoked potentials are used to diagnose hearing losses. They can distinguish damage to the acoustic nerve (which carries signals from the ear to the brain stem) from damage to the auditory pathways within the brain- stem. Most auditory EPs record activity from the brain- stem, and are therefore called \u201cbrainstem auditory evoked potentials.\u201d Disorders diagnosed with auditory EPs include acoustic neuroma (tumors of the inner ear) and multiple sclerosis (chronic disease in which nerves lose patches of their outer covering). They may also be used to assess high frequency hearing ability, to determine brain death, and to monitor brainstem function during surgery \u2022 Somatosensory evoked potentials record transmission of nerve impulses from the limbs to the brain, and can be used to diagnose nerve damage or degeneration within the spinal cord or nerve roots from multiple sclerosis, trauma, or other degenerative disease. Somatosensory EPs can be used to distinguish central versus peripheral nerve disease, when combined with results from a nerve conduction velocity test, which measures nerve function in the extremities. Precautions Evoked potential studies are painless, noninvasive, and without any significant risk. Somatosensory EP tests involve very mild electric shocks, usually felt as a tingling. Description The person performing the test locates and marks specific spots on the patient\u2019s head for placement of elec- trodes. These spots are cleaned, and an adhesive conduct- ing paste is applied. Cup electrodes are attached. For somatosensory EP, spots on the arm or leg are also marked and cleaned; electrodes may be taped in place. The patient sits or reclines in a chair throughout the tests. For a visual EP, the patient focuses on a TV screen which displays a checkerboard pattern. The eye not being tested is covered with a patch. For children or others whose attention may wander, goggles are used which show the pattern to one eye at a time. Each eye is usually tested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate- ly 30\u201345 minutes. For auditory EP, headphones are used to deliver a series of clicks to one ear at a time. A masking or static sound is played into the other ear. Each ear is usually tested twice, and the entire procedure takes approximate- ly 30\u201345 minutes. For somatosensory EP, mild electrical shocks are delivered to the arm or leg. This may cause some twitch- ing and tingling. The stimulus lasts for about two min- utes at a time, and the entire procedure takes approxi- mately 30 minutes. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1248 Evoked potential studies",

Paula Anne Ford-Martin Electrolyte disorders Definition An electrolyte disorder is an imbalance of certain ionized salts (i.e., bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, magne- sium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium) in the blood. Description Electrolytes are ionized molecules found throughout the blood, tissues, and cells of the body. These mole- cules, which are either positive (cations) or negative (anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance pH and acid-base levels in the body. Electrolytes also facilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells through a process known as osmosis and play a part in regulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine, and excretory systems. The serum electrolytes include: \u2022 Sodium (Na). A positively charged electrolyte that helps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates neuromuscular functioning. \u2022 Potassium (K). A main component of cellular fluid, this positive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular function and osmotic pressure. \u2022 Calcium (Ca). A cation, or positive electrolyte, that affects neuromuscular performance and contributes to skeletal growth and blood coagulation. \u2022 Magnesium (Mg). Influences muscle contractions and intracellular activity. A cation. \u2022 Chloride (CI). An anion, or negative electrolyte, that regulates blood pressure. \u2022 Phosphate (HPO4). Negative electrolyte that impacts metabolism and regulates acid-base balance and calci- um levels. \u2022 Bicarbonate (HCO3). A negatively charged electrolyte that assists in the regulation of blood pH levels. Bicar- bonate insufficiencies and elevations cause acid-base disorders (i.e., acidosis, alkalosis). Medications, chronic diseases, and trauma (i.e., burns, fractures, etc. ) may cause the concentration of certain electrolytes in the body to become too high (hyper-) or too low (hypo-). When this happens, an elec- trolyte imbalance, or disorder, results. Causes and symptoms Sodium HYPERNATREMIA. Sodium helps the kidneys to regu- late the amount of water the body retains or excretes. Consequently, individuals with elevated serum sodium levels also suffer from a loss of fluids, or dehydration . Hypernatremia can be caused by inadequate water intake, excessive fluid loss (i.e., diabetes insipidus, kid- ney disease, severe burns, and prolonged vomiting or diarrhea), or sodium retention (caused by excessive sodi- um intake or aldosteronism).

DI is easily confused with an entirely unrelated dis- order, psychogenic polydipsia. Polydipsia refers to drinking large amounts of water. Psychogenic polydipsia is a psychiatric problem that makes a person drink huge quantities of water uncontrollably. Symptoms of DI include extreme thirst and the pro- duction of tremendous quantities of urine. Patients with DI typically drink huge amounts of water, and usually report a specific craving for cold water. When the amount of water passed in the urine exceeds the patient\u2019s ability to drink ample replacement water, the patient may begin to suffer from symptoms of dehydration . These symp- toms include weakness, fatigue, fever, low blood pres- sure, increased heart rate, dizziness , and confusion. If left untreated, the patient could lapse into unconscious- ness and die. Diagnosis Diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with sudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami- nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made up mostly of water with no solute. Examination of the blood will reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute and low in fluid volume. A water deprivation test may be performed. This test requires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient is weighed just before the test begins, and urine is collected and examined hourly. The test is stopped when: \u2022 the patient has lost more than 5% of his or her original body weight \u2022 the patient has reached certain limits of low blood pres- sure and increased heart rate \u2022 the urine is no longer changing significantly from one sample to the next in terms of solute concentration The next step of the test involves injecting a synthet- ic form of ADH, with one last urine sample examined 60 minutes later. Comparing plasma and urine osmolality allows the doctor to diagnose either central DI, nephro- genic DI, partial DI, or psychogenic polydipsia. Treatment A number of medications can be given to decrease the quantity of fluid passed out into the urine. These include vasopressin (Pitressin) injected and desmo- pressin acetate (DDA VP) inhaled through the nose. Other medications that may be given include some antidiuretic drugs (chlorpropamide, clofibrate, carbamazepine).

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurally mediated hypotension , causes a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person has been standing, exercising or exposed to heat for a while.

Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries. Normal results ECT often produces dramatic improvement in the signs and symptoms of major depression, especially in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1150 Electroconvulsive therapy",

Treatment Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is best treated by attacking the underlying cause whenever possible. For example, when cystinosis is treated with the drug cysteamine to lower cystine levels in the body or Wilson disease is treated with penicillamine to lower the levels of copper, accom- panying symptoms of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome will subside. If the patient has acquired the disease from a heavy metal or another toxic agent, all contact with the toxic agent should stop; the condition will then likely disappear. Nevertheless, additional treatment will be necessary either when it\u2019s not possible to treat the underlying cause or while waiting for the kidneys to resume normal func- tion. This is done by restricting sodium chloride (table salt), giving antacids to counteract the excessive acidity of the blood, and supplying potassium supplements. Kidney transplant is the treatment of last resort, used for patients whose kidneys have failed. Prognosis Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be reversible. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome caused by kidney transplantation usually reverses itself within the first year after transplant surgery. When caused by a toxin in the environment, Fanconi\u2019s syndrome generally can be reversed by remov- ing the causative agent from the patient\u2019s environment. If it is caused by a genetic disease, it can usually be reversed by treating the disease. However, if Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is not treated or if treatment is unsuccessful, the kidneys can fail. Prevention Fanconi\u2019s syndrome caused secondarily by the genetic diseases galactosemia, glycogen storage disease, hereditary fructose intolerance, and tyrosinemia is pre- vented by appropriate dietary restrictions to treat the genetic disease, starting in infancy. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome caused by heavy metals and other toxins can be prevented by avoiding these substances.

It varies in thickness, density, elasticity, and composition, and is different from ligaments and tendons. The fascia can be injured either through constant strain or through trauma. Fasciitis is an inflammation of the fascia. The most common condition for which fas- ciotomy is performed is plantar fasciitis, an inflamma- tion of the fascia on the bottom of the foot that is some- times called a heel spur or stone bruise.

In this procedure, a tissue sample is removed from the liver and is examined under a micro- scope in order to learn more about the organ. Treatment The goal of treatment is to cure or reduce the condi- tion causing cirrhosis, prevent or delay disease progres- sion, and prevent or treat complications. Salt and fluid intake are often limited, and activity is encouraged. A diet high in calories and moderately high in protein can benefit some patients. Tube feedings or vita- min supplements may be prescribed if the liver continues to deteriorate. Patients are asked not to consume alcohol. Medication Iron supplements, diuretics, and antibiotics may be used for anemia, fluid retention, and ammonia accumula- tion associated with cirrhosis. Vasoconstrictors are some- times needed to stop internal bleeding and antiemetics may be prescribed to control nausea. Laxatives help the body absorb toxins and acceler- ate their removal from the digestive tract. Beta blockers may be prescribed to control cirrhosis-induced portal hypertension. Because the diseased liver can no longer efficiently neutralize harmful substances, medications must be given with caution. Interferon medicines may be used by patients with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C to prevent post-hepatic cirrhosis. Surgery Medication that causes scarring can be injected directly into veins to control bleeding from varices in the stomach or esophagus. Varices may require a special sur- gical procedure called balloon tamponade ligation to stop the bleeding. Surgery may be required to repair disease- related throat damage. It is sometimes necessary to remove diseased portions of the spleen and other organs. Liver transplants can benefit patients with advanced cirrhosis. However, the new liver will eventually become diseased unless the underlying cause of cirrhosis is removed. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must demon- strate a willingness to stop drinking before being consid- ered suitable transplant candidates. Supportive measures A balanced diet promotes regeneration of healthy liver cells. Eating five or six small meals throughout the day should prevent the sick or bloated feeling patients with cirrhosis often have after eating. Alcohol and caf- feine, which destroy liver cells, should be avoided. So should any foods that upset the stomach. Patients with brain disease associated with cirrhosis should avoid excessive amounts of protein in the diet. A patient can keep a food diary that describes what was eaten, when it was eaten, and how the patient felt afterwards. This diary can be useful in identifying foods that are hard to digest and in scheduling meals to coin- cide with the times the patient is most hungry. Patients who have cirrhosis should weigh them- selves every day and notify their doctor of a sudden gain of five pounds or more. A doctor should also be notified if symptoms of cirrhosis appear in anyone who has not been diagnosed with the disease. A doctor should also be notified if a patient diagnosed with cirrhosis: \u2022 vomits blood \u2022 passes black stools \u2022 seems confused or unresponsive \u2022 shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness, pain) Alternative treatment Alternative treatments for cirrhosis are aimed at pro- moting the function of healthy liver cells and relieving the symptoms associated with the disease. Several herbal remedies may be helpful to cirrhosis patients. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale ) and rock-poppy ( Chelidonium majus) may help improve the efficiency of liver cells. Milk thistle extract ( Silybum marianum ) may slow dis- ease progression and significantly improve survival rates in alcoholics and other cirrhosis patients. Practitioners of homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine can also prescribe treatments that support healthy liver function. Prognosis Cirrhosis-related liver damage cannot be reversed, but further damage can be prevented by patients who: \u2022 eat properly \u2022 get enough rest \u2022 do not consume alcohol \u2022 remain free of infection If the underlying cause of cirrhosis cannot be cor- rected or removed, scarring will continue. The liver will fail, and the patient will probably die within five years. Patients who stop drinking after being diagnosed with cirrhosis can increase their likelihood of living more than a few years from 40% to 60\u201370%. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 817 Cirrhosis",

A cleft lip, sometimes referred to as a harelip, is an opening in the upper lip that can extend into the base of the nostril. A cleft palate is an opening in the roof of the mouth. Description Babies born with cleft lips will have an opening involv- ing the upper lip. The length of the opening ranges from a small notch, to a cleft that extends into the base of the nos- tril. Cleft lips may involve one or both sides of the lip. Babies born with cleft palates have openings in the palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and posi- tion of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in the hard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the mouth, opening into the floor of the nose. It may be only in the soft palate, the soft portion of the roof of the mouth. The cleft palate may involve both the hard and soft palate and may occur on both sides of the center of the palate. Babies may have cleft lips with or without cleft palates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips. The incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated with a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native Ameri- cans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns. The inci- dence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in 1,000. The inci- dence among whites is one in 1,000 newborns. African Americans have an incidence of 0.3 in 1,000 newborns. Causes and symptoms Cleft lips and palates not associated with a syn- drome are caused by a combination of genetic and envi- ronmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a combi- nation is called multifactorial. The embryo inherits genes that increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate. When an embryo with such genes is exposed to certain environ- mental factors the embryo develops a cleft. The risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or palate increases with the number of affected relatives and increases with relatives that have more severe clefts. Environmental factors that increase the risk of cleft lip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use during GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2818 Cleft lip and palate",

Liver injury, reactions to prescription medications, exposure to toxic substances, and repeated episodes of heart failure with liver congestion can cause cirrhosis. The disorder can also be a result of diseases that run in families (inherited diseases) like: \u2022 a lack of a specific liver enzyme (alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency) \u2022 the absence of a milk-digesting enzyme (galactosemia) \u2022 an inability to convert sugars to energy (glycogen stor- age disease) \u2022 an absorption deficit in which excess iron is deposited in the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs (hemochro- matosis) \u2022 a disorder characterized by accumulations of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas (Wilson\u2019s disease) Poor nutrition increases a person\u2019s risk of develop- ing cirrhosis. In about 10 out of every 100 patients, the cause of cirrhosis cannot be determined. Many people who have cirrhosis do not have any symptoms (often called compensated cirrhosis). Their disease is detected during a routine physical or when tests for an unrelated medical problem are performed. This type of cirrhosis can also be detected when complications occur (decom- pensated cirrhosis). Symptoms of cirrhosis are usually caused by the loss of functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to scarring. The liver enlarges during the early stages of illness. The palms of the hands turn red and patients may experience: \u2022 constipation \u2022 diarrhea \u2022 dull abdominal pain \u2022 fatigue \u2022 indigestion \u2022 loss of appetite \u2022 nausea \u2022 vomiting \u2022 weakness \u2022 weight loss As the disease progresses, the spleen enlarges and fluid collects in the abdomen (ascites) and legs (edema). Spider-like blood vessels appear on the chest and shoul- ders, and bruising becomes common. Men sometimes lose chest hair. Their breasts may grow and their testicles may shrink. Women may have menstrual irregularities. Cirrhosis can cause extremely dry skin and intense itching . The whites of the eyes and the skin may turn yellow ( jaundice ), and urine may be dark yellow or brown. Stools may be black or bloody. Sometimes the patient develops persistent high blood pressure due to the scarring (portal hypertension ). This type of hyperten- sion can be life threatening. It can cause veins to enlarge in the stomach and in the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach (esophagus). These enlarged veins are called varices, and they can rupture and bleed massively. Other symptoms of cirrhosis include: \u2022 anemia \u2022 bleeding gums \u2022 decreased interest in sex \u2022f e v e r \u2022 fluid in the lungs \u2022 hallucinations \u2022 lethargy \u2022 lightheadedness \u2022 muscle weakness \u2022 musty breath \u2022 painful nerve inflammation (neuritis) \u2022 slurred speech \u2022 tremors If the liver loses its ability to remove toxins from the brain, the patient may have additional symptoms. The patient may become forgetful and unresponsive, neglect personal care, have trouble concentrating, and acquire new sleeping habits. These symptoms are related to ammonia intoxication and the failure of the liver to con- vert ammonia to urea. High protein intake in these patients can also lead to these symptoms. Diagnosis A patient\u2019s medical history can reveal illnesses or lifestyles likely to lead to cirrhosis. Liver changes can be seen during a physical examination . A doctor who sus- pects cirrhosis may order blood and urine tests to measure liver function. Because only a small number of healthy cells are needed to carry out essential liver functions, test results may be normal even when cirrhosis is present. Computed tomography scans (CT), ultrasound, and other imaging techniques can be used during diagno- sis. They can help determine the size of the liver, indicate healthy and scarred areas of the organ, and detect gall- stones. Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed during surgery or by examining the liver with a laparoscope. This view- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 816 Cirrhosis",

Spirulina is a sea algae that is fre- quently given to assist in eliminating heavy metals. Lipotropic agents are certain vitamins and nutrients that promote the flow of bile and fat from the liver. Many herbal supplements are used in detoxification therapies as well. Milk thistle extract, called silymarin, is one of the more potent herbs for detoxifying the liver. Naturopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, and traditional Chi- nese medicine (TCM) recommend numerous herbal for- mulas for detoxification and immune strengthening. If infections or parasites have been found, these are treated with herbal formulas and, in difficult cases, antibiotics. For toxic bowel syndrome and digestive tract disor- ders, herbal laxatives and high fiber foods such as psylli- um seeds may be given to cleanse the digestive tract and promote elimination. Colonics are used to cleanse the lower intestines. Digestive enzymes are prescribed to improve digestion, and acidophilus and other friendly bacteria are reintroduced into the system with nutritional supplements. Fasting is another major therapy in detoxification. Fasting is one of the quickest ways to promote the elimina- tion of stored toxins in the body and to prompt the healing process. People with severe toxic conditions are supervised closely during fasting because the number of toxins in the body temporarily increases as they are being released. Chelation therapy is used by detoxification special- ists to rid the body of heavy metals. Chelates are particu- lar substances that bind to heavy metals and speed their elimination. Homeopathic remedies have also been shown to be effective for removing heavy metals. Sweating therapies can also detoxify the body because the skin is a major organ of elimination. Sweating helps release those toxins that are stored in the subcuta- neous (under the skin) fat cells. Saunas, therapeutic baths, and exercise are some of these treatments. Body therapies may also be prescribed, including massage therapy, acu- pressure, shiatsu, manual lymph drainage, and polarity therapy. These body therapies seek to improve circulatory and structural problems, reduce stress, and promote heal- ing responses in the body. Mind/body therapies such as psychotherapy, counseling, and stress management tech- niques may be used to heal the psychological components of illness and to help patients overcome their negative pat- terns contributing to illness. Practitioners and treatment costs The costs of detoxification therapies can vary wide- ly, depending on the number of tests and treatments required. Detoxification treatments can be lengthy and involved since illnesses associated with toxic conditions usually develop over many years and may not clear up quickly. Detoxification treatments may be lengthy because they often strive for the holistic healing of the body, mind, and emotions. Practitioners may be conventionally trained medical doctors with specialties in environmental medicine or interests in alternative treatment. The majority of detoxi- fication therapists are alternative practitioners, such as naturopaths, homeopaths, ayurvedic doctors, or tradition- al Chinese doctors.

          "content": "\u2022 death Cirrhosis is the seventh leading cause of disease- related death in the United States. It is twice as common in men as in women. The disease occurs in more than half of all malnourished chronic alcoholics and kills about 25,000 people a year. It is the third most common cause of death in adults between the ages of 45 and 65. Types of cirrhosis Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is the form of the dis- ease most common in the United States. About 30\u201350% of all cases of cirrhosis are this type. Nine out of every 10 people who have nutritional cirrhosis have a history of alcoholism . Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is also called La\u00ebnnec\u2019s cirrhosis. Biliary cirrhosis is caused by intrahepatic bile-duct diseases that impede bile flow. Bile is formed in the liver and is carried by ducts to the intestines. Bile then helps digest fats in the intestines. Biliary cirrhosis can scar or block these ducts. It represents 15\u201320% of all cirrhosis. Various types of chronic hepatitis, especially hepati- tis B and hepatitis C , can cause postnecrotic cirrhosis. This form of the disease affects up to 40% of all patients who have cirrhosis. Disorders like the inability to metabolize iron and similar disorders may cause pigment cirrhosis ( hemo- chromatosis), which accounts for 5\u201310% of all instances of the disease. Causes and symptoms Long-term alcoholism is the primary cause of cir- rhosis in the United States. Men and women respond dif- ferently to alcohol. Although most men can safely con- sume two to five drinks a day, one or two drinks a day can cause liver damage in women. Individual tolerance to alcohol varies, but people who drink more and drink more often have a higher risk of developing cirrhosis. In some people, one drink a day can cause liver scarring. Chronic liver infections like hepatitis B and particu- larly hepatitis C are commonly linked to cirrhosis. Peo- ple at high risk of contracting hepatitis B include those exposed to the virus through contact with blood and body fluids. This includes healthcare workers and intraveneous GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 815 Cirrhosis A micrograph of a human liver showing tissue damaged by cirrhosis.(Photograph by Professor P .

Preparation Despite a long-standing belief that infants do not experience serious pain from circumcision, most author- ities now believe that some form of local anesthesia is necessary. The physician injects local anesthesia at the base of the penis or under the skin around the penis (sub- cutaneous ring block). Both anesthetics block key nerves. EMLA cream, a topical formula of several anes- thetics can also be used. Aftercare After circumcision, the wound should be washed daily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may be applied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound dress- ing will be present and should be changed each time the diaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is used instead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off in five to eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10 days. Infants who undergo circumcision may be fussy for some hours afterward, so parents should be prepared for crying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generally these go away within a day. In older boys, the penis may be painful, but this will go away gradually. A topical anesthet- ic ointment or spray may be used to relieve this temporary discomfort. There may also be a \u201cbruise\u201d on the penis, which typically goes away with no particular attention. Risks Complications following newborn circumcision appear in one out of every 500 procedures. Most compli- cations are minor. Bleeding occurs in half of the compli- cations and is usually easy to control. Infections are rare and present with fever and signs of inflammation. There may be injuries to the penis itself, and these may be difficult to repair. In 2000, there were reports that the surgical clamps used in circumcision were at fault in over 100 injuries reported between July 1996 and January 2000. In nearly all cases, the clamps were assumed to be in working order but had been repaired with replacement parts that were not of the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Physicians were urged to inspect the clamps before use and ensure that their dimensions fit their infant patients. Resources BOOKS Gollaher, David L.

Description Cirrhosis changes the structure of the liver and the blood vessels that nourish it. The disease reduces the liver\u2019s ability to manufacture proteins and process hor- mones, nutrients, medications, and poisons. Cirrhosis gets worse over time and can become potentially life threatening.

Lata Cherath, PhD Enterohemorrhagic E. coli see Escherichia coli Enterostomy Definition An enterostomy is an operation in which the surgeon makes a passage into the patient\u2019s small intestine through the abdomen with an opening to allow for drainage or to insert a tube for feeding. The opening is called a stoma, from the Greek word for mouth. Enterostomies may be either temporary or permanent. They are classified accord- ing to the part of the intestine that is used to create the stoma. If the ileum, which is the lowest of the three sec- tions of the small intestine, is used to make the stoma, the operation is called an ileostomy. If the jejunum, which is the middle section of the small intestine, is used, the oper- ation is called a jejunostomy. Some people use the word ostomy as a word that covers all types of enterostomies. Purpose Enterostomies are performed in order to create a new opening for the passage of fecal matter when normal intestinal functioning is interrupted or when diseases of the intestines cannot be treated by medications or less radical surgery. Some situations that may require entero- stomies include: \u2022 Healing of inflamed bowel segments. Enterostomies performed for this reason are usually temporary. \u2022 Emergency treatment of gunshot or other penetrating wounds of the abdomen. An enterostomy is needed to prevent the contents of the intestine from causing a seri- ous inflammation of the inside of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis ). These enterostomies are also often tem- porary. \u2022 Placement of a tube for enteral feeding. Enteral feeding is a method for conveying nutritional solutions directly into the stomach or jejunum through a tube. Tube enterostomies may be long-term but are not permanent. \u2022 Removal of diseased sections of the intestines. Ileostomies performed for this reason are permanent. The most common disorders requiring permanent ileostomy are Crohn\u2019s disease, familial polyposis, and ulcerative colitis . Familial polyposis and ulcerative colitis are serious health risks because they can develop into cancer. \u2022 Treatment of advanced cancer or other causes of intesti- nal obstruction. Precautions Enterostomies are usually performed only as emer- gency treatments for traumatic injuries in the abdomen or as final measures for serious disorders of the intestines. Most patients do not refuse to have the operation per- formed when the need for it is explained to them. A small minority, however, refuse enterostomies because of strong psychological reactions to personal disfigurement and the need to relearn bowel habits. Description Ileostomy Ileostomies represent about 25% of enterostomies. They are performed after the surgeon removes a diseased colon and sometimes the rectum as well. The most com- mon ileostomy is called a Brooke ileostomy after the English surgeon who developed it. In a Brooke ileosto- my, the surgeon makes the stoma in the lower right sec- tion of the abdomen. The ileum is pulled through an opening (incision) in the muscle layer. The surgeon then turns the cut end of the intestine inside out and sews it to the edges of the hole. He or she then positions an appli- ance for collecting the fecal material. The appliance con- sists of a plastic bag that fits over the stoma and lies flat against the abdomen. The patient is taught to drain the bag from time to time during the day. Ileostomies need to be emptied frequently because the digested food contains large amounts of water. Shortly after the operation, the ileostomy produces 1\u20132 qt (0.9\u20131.91) of fluid per day; after a month or two of adjustment, the volume decreases to 1\u20132 pt (0.5\u20130.9)per day. KOCK POUCH (CONTINENT ILEOSTOMY). The Kock pouch is a variation of the basic ileostomy and is named for its Swedish inventor. In the Kock technique, the sur- geon forms a pouch inside the abdominal cavity behind the stoma that collects the fecal material. The stoma is shaped into a valve to prevent fluid from leaking onto the patient\u2019s abdomen. The patient then empties the pouch several times daily by inserting a tube (catheter) through the valve. The Kock technique is sometimes called a con- tinent ileostomy because the fluid is contained inside the abdomen. It is successful in 70\u201390% of patients who have it done.

Surgery is used as primary therapy for stages I through III colon cancer unless there are signs that local invasion will not permit complete removal of the tumor, as may occur in advanced stage III tumors. However, this circumstance is very rare, and occurs in less than 2% of all colon cancer cases. After the resection is completed, the ends of the remaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is called an anastomosis. Once healing has occurred, there may be a slight increase in the frequency of bowel movements. This effect usually lasts only for several weeks. Most patients go on to develop completely normal bowel function. Occasionally, the anastomosis would be risky and cannot be performed. (Most commonly, this occurs when the bowel could not be adequately evacuated in an emer- gency circumstance due to bowel obstruction.) When the anastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is per- formed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing the end of the colon through the abdominal wall and sewing it to the skin. The patient will have to wear an appliance (a bag) to manage the stool. The colostomy may be tempo- rary and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later, safer date, or the colostomy may be permanent. In most cases, emergent colostomies are not reversed and are permanent. Radiation Radiation therapy is used as an adjunct to surgery if there is concern about potential for local recurrence post-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate the radiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle of the abdominal wall but was not completely removed, this area would be considered for radiation. Radiation has significant dose limits when residual bowel is exposed to it because the small and large intestine do not tolerate radiation well. Radiation is also used in the treatment of patients who present with or progress to having metastatic dis- ease. It is particularly useful in shrinking metastatic colon cancer to the brain. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is useful for patients who have had all identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recur- rence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may also be used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond the scope of regional therapy, but this use is rare. Adjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease with deep penetration or in stage III patients. Standard therapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil, (5FU) combined with leucovorin for a period of six to 12 months. 5FU is an antimetabolite and leukovorin improves the response rate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancer in response to the chemotherapy.) Another agent, lev- amisole, (which seems to stimulate the immune system), may be substituted for leucovorin. These protocols reduce rate of recurrence by about 15% and reduce mor- tality by about 10%. The regimens do have some toxicity, but usually are tolerated fairly well. Similar chemotherapy may be administered for stage IV disease or if a patient progresses and develops metas- tases. Results show response rates of about 20%. Unfortu- nately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease, and this chemotherapy may not prolong survival or improve quality of life in Stage IV patients. Clinical trials have now shown that the results can be improved with the addition of another agent to this regimen. Irinotecan does not seem to increase toxicity but it improved response rates to 39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival, and prolonged overall survival by a little over two months. Alternative treatment Alternative therapies have not been studied in a large-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins , fiber, and green tea are among therapies tried. Avoiding cigarettes and alcohol may be helpful. Before initiating any alternative therapies, the patient is wise to consult his/her physician to be sure that these therapies do not complicate or interfere with the established therapy. Prognosis Prognosis is the long-term outlook or survival after therapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated for colon cancer survive the disease. As expected, the survival rates are dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis, making early detection a very worthwhile endeavor. About 15% of patients present with stage I disease and 85\u201390% survive. Stage II represents 20\u201330% of cases and 65\u201375% survive. Thirt to forty percent com- prise the stage III presentation of which 55% survive. The remaining 20\u201325% present with stage IV disease and are very rarely cured. Prevention There is not an absolute way of preventing colon cancer. Still, there are steps an individual can take to dra- matically lessen the risk or to identify the precursors of colon cancer so that it does not manifest itself.

Jejunostomies are per- formed less frequently than ileostomies. They are almost always temporary procedures. Tube enterostomies Tube enterostomies are operations in which the sur- geon makes a stoma into the stomach itself or the jejunum in order to insert a tube for liquid nutrients. Tube enterostomies are performed in patients who need tube feeding for longer than six weeks, or who have had recent mouth or nose surgery. As long as the patient\u2019s intestinal tract can function, tube feedings are consid- ered preferable to intravenous feeding. Enteral nutrition is safer than intravenous fluids and helps to keep the patient\u2019s digestive tract functioning. Preparation Preoperative preparation includes both patient edu- cation and physical preparation. KEY TERMS Crohn\u2019s disease \u2014A disease of the intestines that causes inflammation leading to scarring, thickening of the walls of the intestine, and eventual obstruc- tion. Duodenum \u2014The first of the three segments of the small intestine. The duodenum connects the stom- ach and the jejunum. Enteral nutrition\u2014A technique for feeding patients with liquid formulas conveyed directly into the stomach or jejunum through tubes. Enterostomal therapist (ET) \u2014A specialized coun- selor, usually a registered nurse, who provides osto- my patients with education and counseling before the operation. After surgery, the ET helps the patient learn to take care of the stoma and appliance, and offers long-term emotional support. Familial polyposis \u2014A disease that runs in families in which lumps of tissue (polyps) form inside the colon. Familial polyposis may develop into cancer. Ileum\u2014The third segment of the small intestine, connecting the jejunum and the large intestine. Jejunum\u2014The second of the three segments of the small intestine, connecting the duodenum and the ileum. Kock pouch\u2014A type of ileostomy in which the sur- geon forms an artificial rectum from a section of the ileum. A Kock pouch is sometimes called a conti- nent ileostomy because it is drained with a tube. Ostomy\u2014A common term for all types of enteros- tomies. Stoma\u2014The surgically constructed mouth or pas- sage between the intestine and the outside of the patient\u2019s body. Tube enterostomy \u2014An enterostomy performed to allow the insertion of a feeding tube into the jejunum or stomach. Ulcerative colitis \u2014A disease of the colon charac- terized by inflammation of the mucous lining, ulcerated areas of tissue, and bloody diarrhea. Patient education If the patient is going to have a permanent ileosto- my, the doctor will explain what will happen during the operation and why it is necessary. Most patients are will- ing to accept an ostomy as an alternative to the chronic pain and diarrhea of ulcerative colitis or the risk of can- cer from other intestinal disorders. The patient can also meet with an enterostomal therapist (ET) or a member of the United Ostomy Association, which is a support group for people with ostomies. Medical preparation The patient is prepared for surgery with an evalua- tion of his or her nutritional status, possible need for blood transfusions, and antibiotics if necessary. If the patient does not have an intestinal obstruction or severe inflammation, he or she may be given a large quantity of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution to cleanse the intestines before surgery.

A loop colostomy is most often performed for creation of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured. Preparation As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be required to sign a consent form after the procedure is explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along with various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG), may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If possi- ble, the patient should visit an enterostomal therapist, who will mark an appropriate place on the abdomen for the stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy management. In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient may be placed on a low residue diet for several days prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at least the day before surgery, with nothing by mouth after mid- night. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations (GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to decrease bacte- ria in the intestine and help prevent post-operative infec- tion. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the stomach on the day of surgery or during surgery to remove gastric secretions and prevent nausea and vom- iting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic tube) may also be inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery, giving more space in the surgical field and decreasing chances of accidental injury. Aftercare Post-operative care for the patient with a new colos- tomy, as with those who have had any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia and the patient\u2019s reluctance to breathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the abdominal incision.

          "content": "Medical aftercare If the enterostomy is temporary, aftercare consists of the usual monitoring of surgical wounds for infection or bleeding. If the patient has had a permanent ileostomy, aftercare includes learning to use the appliance or empty the Kock pouch; learning to keep the stoma clean; and readjusting bathroom habits. Recovery takes a long time because major surgery is a shock to the system and the intestines take several days to resume normal function- ing. The patient\u2019s fluid intake and output will be checked frequently to minimize the risk of dehydration. Patient education Ileostomy patients must learn to watch their fluid and salt intake. They are at greater risk of becoming dehydrat- ed in hot weather, from exercise, or from diarrhea. In some cases they may need extra bananas or orange juice in the diet to keep up the level of potassium in the blood. Patient education includes social concerns as well as physical self-care. Many ileostomy patients are worried about the effects of the operation on their close relationships and employment. If the patient has not seen an ET before the operation, the aftercare period is a good time to find out about self-help and support groups. The ET can also evalu- ate the patient\u2019s emotional reactions to the ostomy. Risks Enterostomies are not considered high-risk opera- tions by themselves. About 40% of ileostomy patients have complications afterward, however; about 15% require minor surgical corrections. Possible complica- tions include: \u2022 skin irritation caused by leakage of digestive fluids onto the skin around the stoma, irritation is the most com- mon complication of ileostomies \u2022 diarrhea \u2022 the development of abscesses \u2022 gallstones or stones in the urinary tract \u2022 inflammation of the ileum \u2022 odors (can often be prevented by a change in diet) \u2022 intestinal obstruction \u2022 a section of the bowel pushing out of the body (pro- lapse) Normal results Normal results include recovery from the surgery with few or no complications. About 95% of people with ostomies recover completely, are able to return to work, and consider themselves to be in good health. Many ileostomy patients enjoy being able to eat a full range of foods rather than living on a restricted diet. Some patients, however, need to be referred to psychotherapists to deal with depression or other emotional problems after the operation. Resources BOOKS Altman, Roberta, and Michael J. Sarg.

Frey Enterovirus infections Definition Enteroviruses are so named because they reproduce initially in the gastrointestinal tract after infection occurs. Despite, this, they usually do not lead to intestinal symp- toms; rather it is their spread to organs, such as the nervous system, heart, skin, and others that causes disease. Enteroviruses are part of a larger group of viruses known as Picornaviruses. The word comes from the combination of \u201cpico\u201d (Spanish, meaning \u201ca little bit\u201d), and RNA (ribonu- cleic acid, an important component of genetic material).

Purpose The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells from the infected person. Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies poten- tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera- tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers.

          "content": "Eye muscle surgery Definition Eye muscle surgery is surgery to weaken, strength- en, or reposition any of the muscles that move the eyeball (the extraocular muscles). Purpose The purpose of eye muscle surgery is generally to align the pair of eyes so that they gaze in the same direc- tion and move together as a team, either to improve appearance or to aid in the development of binocular vision in a young child. To achieve binocular vision, the goal is to align the eyes so that the location of the image on the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of the image on the retina of the other eye. In addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help people with other eye disorders ( nystagmus and Duane syndrome, for example). Precautions Depth perception (stereopsis) develops around the age of three months old. For successful development of binocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen- sionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the age of four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, so an early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even be performed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu- lar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis- es (vision therapy) will probably be necessary. Description The extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the sclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering of the eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginary equator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye. The other end of each of these muscles attaches to a part of the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These muscles enable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or the other, or any angle in between. Normally both eyes move together, receive the same image on corresponding locations on both retinas, and the brain fuses these images into one three-dimensional image. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder where one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, most often outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose (esotropia). The brain now receives two different images, and either suppresses one or the person sees double (diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakening or strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyes toward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward, the muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened. Rarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people with nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con- dition where one or both eyes move rapidly or oscillate; it can sometimes be helped by moving the eyes to the posi- tion of least oscillation. Duane syndrome is a disorder where there is limited horizontal eye movement; it can sometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle. There are two methods to alter extraocular muscles. Traditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, or reposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon first makes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membrane covering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle to prevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle from the eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, the muscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle is removed so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle is reattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle. In a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition- ing it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might be operated on at the same time. Another way of weakening eye muscles, using botu- linum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced in the early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off, the realignment may be permanent, depending upon whether neurological connections for binocular vision were established during the time the toxin was active. This technique can also be used to adjust a muscle after traditional surgery. The cost of eye muscle surgery is about $2,000\u2013 $4,000, and about 700,000 surgeries are performed annu- ally in the United States. Preparation Patients should make sure their doctors are aware of any medications that they are taking, even over-the- counter medications. Patients should not take aspirin,o r any other blood-thinning medications for ten days prior to surgery, and should not eat or drink after midnight the night before. Aftercare Patients will need someone to drive them home after their surgery. They should continue to avoid aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for an addi- tional three days, but they can take acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol). Patients should discuss this with the surgeon to be clear what medications they can or cannot take. Pain will subside after two to three days, and patients can resume most normal activities within a few days. Again, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1269 Eye muscle surgery",

          "content": "Cancer, by definition, is a disease of the genes. A gene is a small part of DNA, which is the master mole- cule of the cell. Genes make \u201cproteins,\u201d which are the ultimate workhorses of the cells. It is these proteins that allow our bodies to carry out all the many processes that permit us to breathe, think, move, etc. Throughout people\u2019s lives, the cells in their bodies are growing, dividing, and replacing themselves. Many genes produce proteins that are involved in controlling the processes of cell growth and division. An alteration (mutation) to the DNA molecule can disrupt the genes and produce faulty proteins. This causes the cell to become abnormal and lose its restraints on growth. The abnormal cell begins to divide uncontrollably and even- tually forms a new growth known as a \u201ctumor\u201d or neo- plasm (medical term for cancer meaning \u201cnew growth\u201d). In a healthy individual, the immune system can rec- ognize the neoplastic cells and destroy them before they get a chance to divide. However, some mutant cells may escape immune detection and survive to become tumors or cancers. Tumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A benign tumor is not considered cancer. It is slow growing, does not spread or invade surrounding tissue, and once it is removed, it doesn\u2019t usually recur. A malignant tumor, on the other hand, is cancer. It invades surrounding tissue and spreads to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells have spread to the surrounding tissues, then, even after the malignant tumor is removed, it generally recurs. A majority of cancers are caused by changes in the cell\u2019s DNA because of damage due to the environment. Environmental factors that are responsible for causing the initial mutation in the DNA are called carcinogens, and there are many types. There are some cancers that have a genetic basis. In other words, an individual could inherit faulty DNA from his parents, which could predispose him to getting cancer. While there is scientific evidence that both factors (envi- ronmental and genetic) play a role, less than 10% of all cancers are purely hereditary. Cancers that are known to have a hereditary link are breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. Besides genes, cer- tain physiological traits could be inherited and could con- tribute to cancers. For example, inheriting fair skin makes a person more likely to develop skin cancer, but only if they also have prolonged exposure to intensive sunlight. There are several different types of cancers: \u2022 Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the layers of cells covering the body\u2019s surface and lining the internal organs and various glands). Ninety percent of human cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can be subdivided into two types: adenocarcinomas and squa- mous cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that develop in an organ or a gland, while squamous cell car- cinomas refer to cancers that originate in the skin. \u2022 Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the pigment cells (melanocytes). \u2022 Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels. \u2022 Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called leukemias and lymphomas respectively. \u2022 Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue. Causes and symptoms The major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco- hol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectious agents, family history, occupation, environment and pol- lution. According to the estimates of the American Cancer Society (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer deaths in 1998 will be due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use. An additional one-third of the deaths will be related to diet and nutrition. Many of the one million skin cancers that are expected to be diagnosed in 1998 will be due to over-exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun\u2019s rays. Tobacco Eighty to ninety percent of the lung cancer cases occur in smokers. Smoking has also been shown to be a contributory factor in cancers of upper respiratory tract, esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably liver, stomach, and kidney as well. Recently, scientists have also shown that second-hand smoke (or passive smoking) can increase one\u2019s risk of developing cancer. Alcohol Excessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in certain cancers, such as liver cancer. Alcohol, in combi- nation with tobacco, significantly increases the chances that an individual will develop mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophageal cancers. Diet Thirty-five percent of all cancers are due to dietary causes. Excessive intake of fat leading to obesity has been associated with cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, pancreas, prostate, gall bladder, ovaries and uterus. Sexual and reproductive behavior The human papilloma virus, which is sexually trans- mitted, has been shown to cause cancer of the cervix. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 632 Cancer",

          "content": "Having too many sex partners and becoming sexually active early has been shown to increase one\u2019s chances of contracting this disease. In addition, it has also been shown that women who don\u2019t have children or have chil- dren late in life have an increased risk for both ovarian and breast cancer. Infectious agents In the last 20 years, scientists have obtained evidence to show that approximately 15% of the world\u2019s cancer deaths can be traced to viruses, bacteria, or parasites. The most common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancers associated with them are shown in table form. Family history Certain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter- ine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami- lies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer \u201cretinoblas- toma,\u201d a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancer known as \u201cearly-onset breast cancer,\u201d have been shown to be linked to certain genes that can be tracked within a family. It is therefore possible that inheriting particular genes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers. Occupational hazards There is evidence to prove that certain occupational hazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam- ple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence of lung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of getting bladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber and gas workers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold miners and arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnish workers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung, bone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura- nium miners. Environment Radiation is believed to cause 1\u20132% of all cancer deaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts for a majority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of radiation are x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation from nuclear material. Pollution Several studies have shown that there is a well- established link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina- tion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk. However, the main danger from pollution occurs when dangerous chemicals from the industries escape into the surrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1% of cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution. Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev- eral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp- toms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occur due to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland. As the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves, organs and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres- sure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer. Despite the fact that there are several hundred differ- ent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms, the ACS has established the following seven symptoms as possible warning signals of cancer: \u2022 changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole \u2022 a sore that does not heal \u2022 persistent cough, hoarseness, or sore throat \u2022 a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere \u2022 unusual bleeding or discharge \u2022 chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing \u2022 any change in bowel or bladder habits Many other diseases, besides cancer, could produce the same symptoms. However, it is important to have these symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especially if they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat- ed, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancers such as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms. Therefore, it is important to undergo routine screening tests such as breast self-exams and mammograms. Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina- tion and a complete medical history. The doctor will observe, feel and palpate (apply pressure by touch) differ- ent parts of the body in order to identify any variations from the normal size, feel and texture of the organ or tissue.

          "content": "Chemotherapy Definition Chemotherapy is treatment of cancer with anti- cancer drugs. Purpose The main purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancer cells. It is usually used to treat patients with cancer that has spread from the place in the body where it started (metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells any- where in the body. It even kills cells that have broken off from the main tumor and traveled through the blood or lymph systems to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In some cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cells or to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body. When a cancer has been removed by surgery, chemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from com- ing back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also can ease the symptoms of cancer, helping some patients to have a better quality of life. Precautions There are many different types of chemotherapy drugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treating cancer, determine which drugs are best suited for each patient. This decision is based on the type of cancer, the patient\u2019s age and health, and other drugs the patient is taking. Some patients should not be treated with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age and other conditions may affect the drugs with which a person may be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes are conditions that may limit the choice of treatment drugs. Description More than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently available to treat cancer and many more are being tested for their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most chemothera- py drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul- tiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body, many useful treatments are most effective against rapidly growing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than most other body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of the bone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom- ach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There- fore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy are linked to their effects on other fast growing cells. Types of chemotherapy drugs Chemotherapy drugs are classified based on how they work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs are described below: \u2022 Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking DNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos- phamide is an alkylating drug. \u2022 Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA and keep cells from growing and multiplying. An example of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). \u2022 Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub- stances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere with important cell functions, including production of DNA and cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong to this group of chemotherapy drugs. \u2022 Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally. Vinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtained from the periwinkle plant. \u2022 Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that depend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancers that depend on the hormone estrogen for growth. Combination chemotherapy Chemotherapy is usually given in addition to other cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy. When given with other treatments, it is called adjuvant chemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera- py drug or combination of drugs will work best for each patient. The use of two or more drugs together often works better than a single drug for treating cancer. This is called combination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of different drug combinations help doctors learn which combinations work best for each type of cancer. How chemotherapy is given Chemotherapy is administered in different ways, depending on the drugs to be given and the type of can- cer. Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy drugs con- sidering many factors, among them being the patient\u2019s height and weight. Chemotherapy may be given by one or more of the following methods: \u2022 orally \u2022 by injection \u2022 through a catheter or port \u2022 topically GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 740 Chemotherapy",

Doctors can tell if the chemotherapy is working by the results of medical tests. Physical examination, blood tests, and x rays are all used to check the effects of treat- ment on the cancer. The possible outcomes of chemotherapy are: \u2022 Complete remission or response. The cancer complete- ly disappears. The course of chemotherapy is complet- ed and the patient is tested regularly for a recurrence. \u2022 Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in size but does not disappear. The same chemotherapy may be continued or a different combination of drugs may be tried. \u2022 Stabilization. The cancer does not grow or shrink. Other therapy options may be explored.

Toni Rizzo Chest drainage therapy Definition Chest drainage therapy involves the removal of air, blood, pus, or other secretions from the chest cavity. Purpose Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection. Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer- gency or a planned procedure. Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity is also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some- times called thoracostomy tube drainage. Conditions that may need to be treated by chest drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues of the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu- mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions include cancer that causes excessive secretions, empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax (blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage therapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavity after lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung is collapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapy allows the lung to reinflate. Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 743 Chest drainage therapy",

Purpose The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells from the infected person. Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies poten- tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera- tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers.

Lata Cherath Margaret Alic, Ph.D. Cervical conization Definition Cervical conization is both a diagnostic and treat- ment tool used to detect and treat abnormalities of the cervix. It is also known as a cone biopsy or cold knife cone biopsy. Purpose Cervical conization is performed if the results of a cervical biopsy have found a precancerous condition in the cervix. The cervix is the small cylindrical organ at the lower part of the uterus, which separates the uterus from the vagina. Cervical conization also may be performed if there is an abnormal cervical smear test ( PAP test). A biopsy is a diagnostic test in which tissue or cells are removed from the body and examined under a microscope, primarily to look for cancer or other abnormalities. Precautions As with any operation that is performed under gen- eral anesthesia, the patient must not eat or drink anything for six to eight hours before surgery. Description The patient lies on the table with her legs raised in stirrups, similar to the position when having a PAP test. KEY TERMS Biopsy\u2014The removal of a small piece of living tis- sue for examination under a microscope. PAP test \u2014The short term for Papanicolaou test, this procedure tests a smear of cellular material scraped from the cervix and examined under a microscope to detect abnormal cells. The patient is given general anesthesia, and the vagina is held open with an instrument called a speculum. Using a scalpel or laser the doctor removes a cone-shaped piece of the cervix containing the area with abnormal cells. The resulting crater is repaired by stitching flaps of tissue over the wound. Alternatively, the wound may be left open, and heat or freezing is used to stop bleeding. Once the tissue has been removed, it is examined under a microscope for signs of cancer. If cancer is pre- sent, other tests will be needed. Surgery will be per- formed to remove the cervix and uterus ( hysterectomy) and other treatments may be used as well. If the abnor- mal cells are precancerous, a laser can be used to destroy them. Cold knife cone biopsy used to be the preferred treatment for removing abnormal cells in the cervix. Now, most cone biopsies are performed using laser surgery. Cold knife cone biopsy is generally used only for special situations. For example, if a biopsy did not remove all the abnormal cells, the cold knife cone proce- dure allows the physician to remove what\u2019s left. Aftercare An overnight stay in the hospital may be required. After the test, the patient may feel some cramps or dis- comfort for about a week. Women should not have sex, use tampons, or douche until after seeing their physician for a follow up appointment (a week or more after the procedure). Risks Because cone biopsies carry risks such as bleeding and problems with subsequent pregnancies, they have been replaced with newer technologies except in a few circumstances. About one in 10 women experience bleeding from the vagina about two weeks after the biopsy. There is also a slight risk of infection or perforation of the uterus.

If the urinary stream becomes totally blocked, the urine collecting in the blad- der may cause severe discomfort, a condition called acute urinary retention. Urine that stagnates in the blad- der can easily become infected. A burning feeling during urination and fever are clues that infection may have developed. Finally, if urine backs up long enough it may increase pressure in the kidneys, though this rarely caus- es permanent kidney damage. Diagnosis When a man\u2019s symptoms point to BPH, the first thing the physician will want to do is a digital rectal examination , inserting a finger into the anus to feel whether\u2014and how much\u2014the prostate is enlarged. A smooth prostate surface suggests BPH, whereas a dis- tinct lump in the gland might mean prostate cancer . The next step is a blood test for a substance called prostate-specific antigen or PSA. Between 30\u201350% of men with BPH have an elevated PSA level. This does not mean cancer by any means, but other measures are needed to make sure that the prostate enlargement is in fact benign. An ultrasound exam of the prostate, which is entirely safe and delivers no radiation, can show whether it is enlarged and may show that cancer is present. If digital or ultrasound examination of the prostate raises the suspicion of cancer, most urologists will rec- ommend that a prostatic tissue biopsy be performed. This is usually done using a lance-like instrument that is inserted into the rectum. It pierces the rectal wall and, guided by the physcian\u2019s finger, obtains six to eight pieces of prostatic tissue that are sent to the laboratory for microscopic examination. If cancer is present, the prognosis and treatment are changed accordingly. A catheter placed through the urethra and into the bladder can show how much urine remains in the bladder after the patient urinates\u2014a measure of how severe the obstruction is. Another and very simple test for obstruc- tion is to have the man urinate into a uroflowmeter, which measures the rate of urine flow. A very certain\u2014 though invasive\u2014way of confirming obstruction from an enlarged prostate is to pass a special viewing instrument called a cystoscope into the bladder, but this is not often necessary. It is routine to check a urine sample for an increased number of white blood cells, which may mean there is infection of the bladder or kidneys. The same sample may be cultured to show what type of bacterium is caus- ing the infection, and which antibiotics will work best. The state of the kidneys may be checked in two ways: imaging by either ultrasound or injecting a dye (the intra- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1202 Enlarged prostate Enlarged prostate gland Ureter Prostate gland Urine retention in bladder Constricted urethra Normal sized prostate gland Enlarged prostate gland An enlarged prostate is a non-cancerous condition in which the narrowing of the urethra makes the elimination of urine more difficult.

Purpose Cystectomy is performed to treat cancer of the blad- der. Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat bladder cancer. Surgery is used to remove cancer when it is in the muscle of the bladder. Precautions Cystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not be appropriate for patients with superficial tumors that respond to more conservative treatment. Description Cystectomy is a major surgical operation. The patient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision is made across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located, tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad- der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. The bladder and associated organs are removed. In men, the prostate is removed with the bladder. In women, the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina are removed with the bladder. The bladder collects urine from the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since the bladder is removed, a new method must be created to remove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine is removed, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. The other end is used to form a stoma, an opening through the abdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con- nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys now flows down the ureters, into the tube, and through the stoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine. Preparation The medical team will discuss the procedure and tell the patient where the stoma will appear and what it will look like. The patient receives instruction on caring for a stoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated. A period of fasting and an enema may be required. KEY TERMS Ureters \u2014Tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urine produced by the kidneys passes through the ureters to the bladder. Aftercare After the operation, the patient is given fluid-based nutrition until the intestines being to function normally again. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the incision sites. The nature of the organs removed mean that there will be major lifestyle changes for the person undergoing the operation. Men will become impotent because nerves controlling penile erection are cut during removal of the bladder. In women, infertility is a conse- quence because the ovaries and uterus are removed. However, most women who undergo cystectomy are postmenopausal and past their childbearing years. Both men and women are fitted with an external bag that connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bag is generally worn around the waist under the clothing. It takes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing the bag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it is produced, essentially continuously. The stoma must be treated properly to ensure that it does not become infect- ed or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for their stoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust- ment to the major change in life style created by the stoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this by discussion with their physician. Risks As with any major surgery, there is a risk of infec- tion; in this case, infection of the intestine is especially dangerous as it can lead to peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen). Normal results The bladder is successfully removed and a stoma created. Intestinal function returns to normal and the patient learns proper care of the stoma and bag. He or she adjusts to lifestyle changes and returns to a normal rou- tine of work and recreation, some sports excluded. Abnormal results The patient develops an infection at the incision site.

          "content": "Treatment Choriocarcinomas are usually treated by surgical removal of the tumor and chemotherapy . Radiation is occasionally used, particularly for tumors in the brain. Alternative treatment Complementary treatments can decrease stress, reduce the side effects of cancer treatment, and help patients feel more in control. For instance, some people find activities such as yoga, massage, music therapy , meditation, prayer, or mild physical exercise helpful. Prognosis The prognosis for choriocarcinomas in the uterus is very good. Although these tumors have often spread throughout the body, chemotherapy results in a cure or remission in at least 80\u201390% of cases. Women who have had choriocarcinomas often go on to have normal preg- nancies and deliveries. Choriocarcinomas in other sites have a poorer prog- nosis. These tumors tend to spread quickly and don\u2019t always respond well to chemotherapy. Although treat- ment can be effective, the outcome usually depends on how widely the cancer is dispersed. Generally, the prog- nosis is worse if the cancer can be found in the liver or brain, if hCG levels are high, or if the original tumor developed outside the gonads. Five-year survival with testicular cancers can range from 92% for tumors that have spread only to the lungs to 48% to tumors that have spread to other internal organs. Prevention There is no known means of prevention. However, early detection of the symptoms and prompt medical treatment can improve the odds of survival.

Others develop in the uterus after a pregnancy or miscarriage\u2014particularly often after a mole. A few choriocarcinomas arise in sites outside the reproductive organs. Such \u201cextragonadal\u201d tumors are usually found in young adults and are more common in males. Choriocarcinomas are one of the most dangerous germ cell cancers. Choriocarcinomas usually grow quickly and spread widely. Occasionally, this cancer grows so fast that the original tumor outgrows its blood supply and dies, leaving behind only a small scar. Causes and symptoms Choriocarcinomas result from genetic damage to a germ cell. Males with Klinefelter syndrome are espe- cially likely to develop extragonadal germ cell tumors. The symptoms of a choriocarcinoma vary, depend- ing on where the tumor originates and where it spreads. In the uterus, the most common symptom is bleeding. Cancers in the ovary often have only subtle signs such as KEY TERMS Biopsy\u2014A sample of an organ taken to look for abnormalities. Also, the technique used to take such samples.

Choriocarcinomas that spread to other organs may reveal their presence by bleeding. In the brain, this bleeding can cause a stroke. Diagnosis Choriocarcinomas are usually referred to an oncologist, a doctor who specializes in cancer treat- ment. To diagnose this tumor, the doctor will do a physical examination and examine the internal organs with x rays or ultrasound studies. Choriocarci- nomas are not always biopsied before being treated, because they tend to bleed heavily. Spreading of the cancer is detected with x rays, ultrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Most choriocarcinomas make human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone normally found only during pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the blood can help diagnose this cancer and monitor the success of treatment. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 797 Choriocarcinoma",

          "content": "cancer has to be weighed against the side effects of the treatment. If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure is not possible, then the treatment should be aimed at relieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for as long as possible. Cancer treatment can take many different forms, and it is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci- sion on which type of treatment is the most appropriate depends on the type and location of cancer, the extent to which it has already spread, the patient\u2019s age, sex, gener- al health status and personal treatment preferences. The major types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo- therapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone- marrow transplantation. Surgery Surgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the most frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec- tive when a cancer is small and confined to one area of the body. Surgery can be used for many purposes. \u2022 Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves removal of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical- ly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area. Along with the cancer, some part of the normal sur- rounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancer cells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreads via the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes may be examined and sometimes they are removed as well. \u2022 Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery involves removal of an abnormal looking area that is likely to become malignant over time. For example, 40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer- ative colitis, ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than live with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo- ple may choose to have their colons removed and reduce the risk significantly. \u2022 Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag- nosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can be performed by inserting a needle through the skin. How- ever, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissue sample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation. \u2022 Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible, and then treats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo- therapy or both. \u2022 Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not the cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large or has spread so much that removing the entire tumor is not an option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may be so large that it may press on and block a portion of the intestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain and vomiting. \u201cDebulking surgery\u201d may remove a part of the blockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that are dependent on hormones, removal of the organs that secrete the hormones is an option. For example, in prostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi- cles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a man may undergo an \u201corchiectomy\u201d (removal of testi- cles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in a type of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) will stop the synthesis of hormones from the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer. Radiation Radiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone in cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More often, it is used in conjunction with surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter- nal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at the tumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (also known as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in the form of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous site by means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con- tainer.

Other eye surgeries include the following: \u2022 choroidectomy-removal of part of the choroid, \u2022 iridectomy-removal of part of the iris, \u2022 iridocyclectomy-removal of parts of the ciliary body and parts of iris, \u2022 iridotrabeculectomy-removal of parts of the supporting tissues around the cornea and iris. In eye cancer where the tumor is small and there is a good chance that the vision will be restored less drastic measures than the above surgeries are taken. Radiation and chemotherapy are two courses of treatment that help in killing off the existing tumor and preventing its spread into other areas of the body. Besides radiation and chemotherapy there are other methods of treating eye cancer. Cryotherapy uses extreme cold to destroy the cancer cells. Thermotherapy uses heat to destroy the cancer cells. Photocoagulation uses a laser to destroy blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients. If the tumor isn\u2019t advanced these are good options to treat it in order to avoid losing an eye. A radiation/surgical treatment for eye cancer is brachytherapy. A small plaque with radioactive iodine on one side and gold on the other is stitched to the eye behind the tumor with the radioactive iodine facing the tumor. The gold is used to shield the other tissues from the radiation. It is left there for a period of time depend- ing on the dosage of radiation needed and then it is removed. In this way the tumor is treated and hopefully will shrink and eventually die. Alternative Treatment Other than the treatments above, there aren\u2019t any alternative treatments. New clinical trials are constantly under way to further the treatment of the disease in the future. Prognosis All forms of retinoblastoma and intraocular mela- noma are treatable.

Purpose An eye examination is performed by an ophthalmol- ogist M.D. or D.O. (doctor of osteopathy), or an optom- etrist (O.D.) to determine if there are any pre-existing or potential vision problems. Eye exams may also reveal the presence of many non-eye diseases. Many systemic dis- eases can affect the eyes, and since the blood vessels on the retina are observed during the exam, certain problems may be uncovered (e.g., high blood pressure or diabetes). Infants should be examined by a physician to detect any physical abnormalities. Frequency of eye exams then generally differs with age and the health of the person.

Medical therapy to treat the adenomatous polyps has been attempted. Some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been effective in reducing the number and size of the polyps. It is possible that these agents will be used as an additional treatment for FAP, but they are unlikely to replace surgery. Individuals with FAP are at increased risk for cancers of the upper digestive tract including the upper portion of the small bowel (dudodenum) and the channels where bile flows (biliary tract). Cancers of the thyroid, pancreas, and adrenal gland are also more commonly found among FAP patients. Periodic examination for the development of malignancy in these areas is considered part of the treatment of FAP. In some cases, such as cancer involving the duodenum, the tests themselves carry a chance of complications. The risk of the study must be weighed against the potential benefits of knowing the results. Non- malignant growths, called desmoid tumors, also occur more frequently in patients with FAP. Although they are not malignant, they grow quickly into surrounding tis- sues, causing many difficulties, even death in some cases. Prognosis The major cause of death in many patients with FAP remains colorectal cancer. One study suggested that even with improved disease recognition, social and emotional factors, such as fear of surgery, may significantly delay a patient\u2019s treatment. In recent years, the trend is towards mortality from other causes, such as desmoid tumors or cancers other than colorectal. It has been estimated that a patient with known FAP has a relative risk of dying over three times greater than that of the average population, at a given age. Prevention FAP cannot be prevented. Aggressive diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up monitoring are keys to success- ful management of the disease. Resources ORGANIZATIONS Familial Polyposis Registry. Department of Colorectal Surgery.

Family therapy Definition Family therapy is a form of psychotherapy that involves all the members of a nuclear or extended family. It may be conducted by a pair or team of therapists. In many cases the team consists of a man and a woman in order to treat gender-related issues or serve as role mod- els for family members. Although some forms of family therapy are based on behavioral or psychodynamic prin- ciples, the most widespread form is based on family sys- tems theory. This approach regards the family, as a whole, as the unit of treatment, and emphasizes such fac- tors as relationships and communication patterns rather than traits or symptoms in individual members. Family therapy is a relatively recent development in psychotherapy. It began shortly after World War II, when doctors, who were treating schizophrenic patients, noticed that the patients\u2019 families communicated in dis- turbed ways. The doctors also found that the patients\u2019 symptoms rose or fell according to the level of tension between their parents. These observations led to consid- ering a family as an organism or system with its own internal rules, patterns of functioning, and tendency to resist change. The therapists started to treat the families of schizophrenic patients as whole units rather than focusing on the hospitalized member. They found that in many cases the family member with schizophrenia improved when the \u201cpatient\u201d was the family system. (This should not be misunderstood to mean that schizo- phrenia is caused by family problems, although family problems may worsen the condition.) This approach of involving the entire family in the treatment plan and ther- apy was then applied to families with problems other than the presence of schizophrenia. Family therapy is becoming an increasingly com- mon form of treatment as changes in American society are reflected in family structures. It has led to two further developments: couples therapy, which treats relationship GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1287 Family therapy",

Treatment Initial treatment may consist of resting the knee using crutches, along with aspirin , Tylenol, or a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Motrin for seven to 10 days. The person should limit sports activity until the joint is healed and may use ice followed by heat to decrease inflammation. When the doctor allows the patient to resume sports, a knee brace may be prescribed in the form of a stabilizer with a hole at the kneecap. Treatment also includes low impact exercises to strengthen the quadriceps muscles which help stabilize the knee joint. Physical therapy may be suggested at the start of this program so as to help the patient learn the correct method of performing the exercises. Approximately 85% of people do well with conserv- ative CMP treatment. The remainder still have severe pain and may require arthroscopic surgery to repair the tissues inside the knee joint. In more severe cases, open surgery may be required to realign the kneecap and per- haps other corrections. Alternative treatments Physical therapy offers treatments that may help CMP patients. Aqua therapy has the benefit of exercising the knee without putting stress on it and it also strength- ens the thigh muscles. Biofeedback can be used to learn tensing and relaxing specific muscles to relieve pain. These techniques have the benefit of no side effects. Massage therapy might be beneficial as well.

Quadriceps, hip flexors, hamstrings\u2014Major mus- cles in the thigh area which affect knee mechanics.

With proper treatment and preventive techniques, teenagers will com- plete their growth without permanent damage to the joint. Only about 15% of patients require surgical inter- vention. Older people may go on to develop osteoarthri- tis in the knee. Prevention Proper exercises are the best preventive measure. Since tightness of thigh muscles is a risk factor, warming up before athletic activities is recommended, as well as participating in a variety of sports rather than just one. Stretching exercises increase flexibility of the quadri- ceps, hip flexors, and hamstrings. Strengthening exercis- es such as short arc leg extensions, straight leg raises, quadriceps isometric exercises, and stationary bicycling are also recommended.

An important aspect of treatment with flower remedies, is that if you feel instinc- tively that you need a particular remedy, you are encour- aged to act on that instinct. However, it is advisable not to continue a particular remedy once you feel you no longer need it, and to try a different one if you feel that progress is not being made. The remedies are administered from a stoppered bottle and need to be diluted. Individuals sensitive to alcohol can apply the concentrate directly to temples, wrists, behind the ears, or underarms. They should be kept in a cool dark place; like this they should last indef- initely. However, a diluted remedy should not be kept longer than three weeks. Two drops of each diluted rem- edy should be taken four times a day, including first thing in the morning and last thing at night. If the rescue remedy is being used, four drops should be used instead. Most therapists recommend that they be taken in spring water, but the remedy can be taken directly from the bot- tle, if care is taken that the dropper does not touch the tongue, as this would introduce bacteria that would spoil the remedy. It is not recommended that more than six or seven Bach remedies be used at any one time. Instead, it is preferable to divide a larger amount up into two lots to ensure the optimum effectiveness of the remedies. No combination, or amount of combinations of the remedies can cause any harm, rather they become less effective. Unlike FES, the Bach Centre does not encourage research to \u201cprove\u201d that the remedies work, preferring that people find out for themselves. They strive to keep the use of the Bach remedies as simple as possible, and to this end they do not keep case records. Bach warned before he died that others would try to change his work and make it more complicated. He was determined to keep it simple so that anyone could use it, and that is why he limited the system to only 38 remedies. The Centre points out that many who have used Bach\u2019s research as a starting point have added other remedies to the list, even some that Bach himself rejected.

Symptoms of BPH will improve after taking the herb for one to two months, but continued use is recommended. Prognosis In a man without symptoms whose prostate is enlarged, it is hard to predict when urinary symptoms will develop and how rapidly they will progress. For this reasons some specialists (urologists) advise a period of \u201cwatchful waiting.\u201d When BPH is treated by convention- al TUR, there is a small risk of complications but, in the great majority of men, urinary symptoms will be relieved and their quality of life will be much enhanced. In the future, it is possible that the less invasive forms of surgi- cal treatment will be increasingly used to achieve results as good as those of the standard operation. It also is pos- sible that new medications will be developed that shrink the prostate and eliminate obstructive symptoms so that surgery can be avoided altogether. Prevention Whether or not BPH is caused by hormonal changes in aging men, there is no known way of preventing it. Once it does develop and symptoms are present that interfere seriously with the patient\u2019s life, timely medical or surgical treatment will reliably prevent symptoms from getting worse. Also, if the condition is treated before the prostate has become grossly enlarged, the risk of complications is minimal. One of the potentially most serious complications of BPH, urinary infection (and possible infection of the kidneys), can be prevented by using a catheter to drain excess urine out of the bladder so that it does not collect, stagnate, and become infected.

Gram-negative means that the organisms do not retain the violet color of the dye used to make Gram stains. The most troublesome organism in this group is Escherichia coli. Other enterobacteria are species of Sal- monella , Shigella , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Serratia , Proteus, and Yersinia. Description Enterobacterial infections can be produced by bacte- ria that normally live in the human digestive tract without causing serious disease, or by bacteria that enter from the outside. In many cases these infections are nosocomial, which means that they can be acquired in the hospital. Klebsiella and Proteus sometimes cause pneumonia, ear and sinus infections, and urinary tract infections. Enter- obacter and Serratia often cause bacterial infection of the blood ( bacteremia ), particularly in patients with weakened immune systems. Diarrhea caused by enterobacteria is a common problem in the United States. It is estimated that each person in the general population has an average of 1.5 episodes of diarrhea each year, with higher rates in chil- dren, institutionalized people, and Native Americans. This type of enterobacterial infection can range from a minor nuisance to a life-threatening disorder, especially in infants, elderly persons, AIDS patients, and malnour- ished people. Enterobacterial infections are one of the two leading killers of children in developing countries. Causes and symptoms Causes Enterobacterial infections in the digestive tract typi- cally start when the organisms invade the mucous tissues that line the digestive tract. They may be bacteria that are GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21204 Enterobacterial infections",

          "content": "time, but for one-third of patients the artery narrows again within six months. The procedure can be repeated. It is less invasive and less expensive than coronary artery bypass surgery. In coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or vein from an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build a detour around the coronary artery blockage. The healthy vessel then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Bypass surgery is major surgery. It is appropriate for those patients with blockages in two or three major coro- nary arteries, those with severely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and those who have not responded to other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen- eral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to support the patient while the healthy vein or artery is attached past the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% of patients who have bypass surgery experience full relief from angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Only about 3\u20134% of patients per year experience a return of symptoms. Survival rates after bypass surgery decrease over time. At five years after surgery, survival expectancy is 90%; at 10 years about 80%, at 15 years about 55%, and at 20 years about 40%. Three semi-experimental surgical procedures for unblocking coronary arteries are currently being studied. Atherectomy is a procedure in which the cardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque from the blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is inserted into the affected artery to burn or break down the plaque. A metal coil called a stent can be implanted per- manently to keep a blocked artery open. Stenting is becoming more common. Alternative treatment Natural therapies may reduce the risk of certain types of heart disease, but once symptoms appear, con- ventional medical attention is necessary. A healthy diet (including cold-water fish as a source of essential fatty acids) and exercise, important components of conven- tional prevention and treatment strategies, also are emphasized in alternative approaches to coronary artery disease. Herbal medicine has a variety of remedies that may have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease. For example, ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) may help reduce cholesterol. Garlic ( Allium sativum ), ginger, and hot red or chili peppers are all circulatory enhancers that can help prevent blood clots. Yoga and other bodywork, massage, relaxation therapies, and talking therapies may also help prevent coronary artery disease and stop, or even reverse, the progression of atherosclerosis. Vitamin and mineral therapy to reduce, reverse, or protect against coronary artery disease includes chromium; calcium and magnesium; B-complex vitamins; the anti-oxidant vita- mins C and E; selenium; and zinc. Traditional Chinese medicine may recommend herbal remedies, massage, acupuncture, and dietary modification. Prognosis In many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc- cessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death rates from coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s. New diagnostic techniques enable doctors to identify and treat coronary artery disease in its earliest stages. New tech- nologies and surgical procedures have extended the lives of many patients who would otherwise have died. Research on coronary artery disease continues. Prevention A healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery disease and help keep it from progressing. A heart- healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, moderate drinking, no recreational drugs, controlling hypertension, and managing stress. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are excellent to help prevent recurring coronary problems for people who are at risk and who have had coronary events and procedures. Eat right A healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are low in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol, and high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta- bles and limited sodium. Some foods are low in fat but high in cholesterol and some are low in cholesterol but high in fat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol and, in exces- sive amounts, increases the amount of the clot-forming proteins in blood. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are good for the heart. Fat should comprise no more than 30% of total daily calories. Cholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is found in foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal products. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fiber can help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per day. Many popular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol by an average of 25\u201330% when used with a low-fat, low-cho- lesterol diet. Fruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are low-calorie and nearly fat free. Vita- min C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits and veg- etables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into a form that damages coronary arteries.

          "content": "Procedure The surgery team for coronary artery bypass graft surgery includes the cardiovascular surgeon, assisting sur- geons, a cardiovascular anesthesiologist, a perfusion tech- nologist (who operates the heart-lung machine), and spe- cially trained nurses. After general anesthesia is adminis- tered, the surgeon removes the veins or prepares the arter- ies for grafting. If the saphenous vein is to be used, a series of incisions are made in the patient\u2019s thigh or calf. More commonly, a segment of the internal mammary artery will be used and the incisions are made in the chest wall. The surgeon then makes an incision from the patient\u2019s neck to navel, saws through the breastbone, and retracts the rib cage open to expose the heart. The patient is connected to a heart-lung machine, also called a cardiopulmonary bypass pump, that cools the body to reduce the need for oxygen and takes over for the heart and lungs during the procedure. The heart is then stopped and a cold solution of potassium-enriched normal saline is injected into the aor- tic root and the coronary arteries to lower the temperature of the heart, which prevents damage to the tissue. Next, a small opening is made just below the block- age in the diseased coronary artery. Blood will be redirect- ed through this opening once the graft is sewn in place. If a leg vein is used, one end is connected to the coronary artery and the other to the aorta. If a mammary artery is used, one end is connected to the coronary artery while the other remains attached to the aorta. The procedure is repeated on as many coronary arteries as necessary. Most patients who have coronary artery bypass graft surgery have at least three grafts done during the procedure. Electric shocks start the heart pumping again after the grafts have been completed. The heart-lung machine is turned off and the blood slowly returns to normal body temperature. After implanting pacing electrodes (if need- ed) and inserting a chest tube, the surgeon closes the chest cavity. Success rate of coronary artery bypass graft surgery About 90% of patients experience significant improve- ments after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients experience full relief from chest pain and resume their nor- mal activities in about 70% of the cases; the remaining 20% experience partial relief. In 5\u201310% of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries, the bypass graft stops supplying blood to the bypassed artery within one year.

Patients who have poorer results from coronary artery bypass graft surgery include those over the age of 70, those who have poor left ventricular function, or are undergoing a repeat surgery or other procedures con- currently, and those who continue smoking, do not treat high cholesterol or other coronary risk factors, or have another debilitating disease. Long term, symptoms recur in only about 3\u20134% of patients per year. Five years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, survival expectancy is 90%, at 10 years it is about 80%, at 15 years it is about 55%, and at 20 years it is about 40%. Angina recurs in about 40% of patients after about 10 years. In most cases, it is less severe than before the surgery and can be controlled by drug therapy. In patients who have had vein grafts, 40% of the grafts are severely obstructed 10 years after the procedure. Repeat coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be necessary, and is usu- ally less successful than the first surgery. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery There are two new types of minimally invasive coro- nary artery bypass graft surgery: port-access coronary artery bypass (also called PACAB or PortCAB) and min- imally invasive coronary artery bypass (also called MID- CAB). These procedures are minimally invasive because they do not require the neck-to-navel incision, sawing through the breastbone, or opening the rib cage to expose the heart. Both procedures enable surgeons to work on the coronary arteries through small chest holes called ports and other small incisions. Port-access coronary artery bypass requires the use of a heart-lung machine but minimally invasive coronary artery bypass does not. Advantages of these procedures over standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery include a shorter hospital stay, a shorter recovery period, and lower costs. Port-access coronary artery bypass enables surgeons to perform bypasses through smaller incisions. Using a video monitor to view the procedure, the surgeon passes instruments through ports in the patient\u2019s chest to per- form the bypass. Mammary arteries or leg veins are used for the grafts. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass is performed on a beating heart and is appropriate only for bypasses of one or two arteries. Small ports are made in the patient\u2019s chest, along with a small incision directly over the coronary artery to be bypassed. Generally, the surgeon uses a mammary artery for the bypass. Early data on outcomes for port-access coronary artery bypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are favorable. Mortality rates with port-access coronary artery bypass and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are both less than 3%\u2014about the same as in standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery. One clinical trial indicated that survival at seven years was the same in minimally invasive coronary artery bypass and standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but that another intervention was necessary five times more often with minimally invasive coronary artery bypass than with standard coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The American Heart Association Council on Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Surgery feels that both pro- cedures appear promising but that further study is needed. More data covering longer term outcomes are necessary in order to fully assess these procedures. Preparation The patient is usually admitted to the hospital the day before the coronary artery bypass graft surgery is scheduled. Coronary angiography has been previously performed to show the surgeon where the arteries are blocked and where the grafts might best be positioned. The patient is given a blood-thinning drug\u2014usually heparin\u2014that helps to prevent blood clots. The evening before the surgery, the patient showers with antiseptic soap and is shaved from chin to toes. After midnight, food and fluids are restricted. A sedative is prescribed on the morning of surgery and sometimes the night before. Heart monitoring begins. Aftercare The patient recovers in a surgical intensive care unit for at least the first two days after the surgery. He or she is connected to chest and breathing tubes, a mechanical venti- lator, a heart monitor and other monitoring equipment, and a urinary catheter. The breathing tube and ventilator are usually removed within six hours of surgery, but the other tubes remain in place as long as the patient is in the inten- sive care unit. Drugs are prescribed to control pain and to prevent unwanted blood clotting. The patient is closely monitored. Vital signs and other parameters, such as heart sounds and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterial blood, are checked frequently. The chest tube is checked to ensure that it is draining properly. The patient is fed intra- venously for the first day or two. Daily doses of aspirinare started within six to 24 hours after the procedure. Chest physiotherapy is started after the ventilator and breathing tube are removed. The therapy includes coughing, turning frequently, and taking deep breaths. Other exercises will be encouraged to improve the patient\u2019s circulation and prevent complications due to prolonged bed rest. If there are no complications, the patient begins to resume a normal routine around the second day. This includes eating regular food, sitting up, and walking GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 927 Coronary artery bypass graft surgery",

Patients should eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, grains, and non-fat or low-fat dairy products, and reduce fats to less than 30% of all calories. An exercise program will usually be tailored for the patient, who will be encouraged to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program where exercise will be supervised by professionals. Cardiac rehabilitation pro- grams, offered by hospitals and other organizations, may also include classes on heart-healthy living.

Next, the surgeon removes the fat and cholesterol buildup, along with any blood clots that have formed, with a blunt dissecting instrument. Then the surgeon bathes the clean wall in salt solution combined with heparin, an anticoagulant. Then the surgeon stitches the artery just enough so that the bypass shunt tube can be removed, and then he/she stitches the artery completely closed. After checking to make sure no blood is leaking, the surgeon next closes the skin incision with stitches. The operation should improve symptoms, although its long-term effects may be more limited, since arterial narrowing is rarely confined to one area of one artery. If narrowing is a problem throughout the body, arterial reconstructive surgery may be required. The total cost of an endarterectomy, including diag- nostic tests, surgery, hospitalization, and follow-up care, will vary according to hospital, doctor, and area of the country where the operation is performed, but a patient can expect to pay in the range of $15,000. Patients who are very young, very old, or very ill, or who need more extensive surgery, may require more expensive treatment. Preparation Before surgery, the doctor pinpoints the location of the narrowed artery with an x-ray procedure called angiography . For surgery to be effective, the degree of narrowing should be at least 70%, but it should not be total. Patients undergoing angiography are given a local anesthetic, but the endarterectomy itself requires the use of a general anesthesia. Aftercare After the surgery, the patient spends the first two days lying flat in bed. Patients who have had carotid endarterectomy should not bend the neck sharply during this time.

Maureen Haggerty Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Definition Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a surgical procedure in which one or more blocked coronary arter- ies are bypassed by a blood vessel graft to restore normal blood flow to the heart. These grafts usually come from the patient\u2019s own arteries and veins located in the leg, arm, or chest. Purpose Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (also called coronary artery bypass surgery, CABG, and bypass oper- ation) is performed to restore blood flow to the heart. This relieves chest pain and ischemia , improves the patient\u2019s quality of life, and in some cases, prolongs the patient\u2019s life. The goals of the procedure are to enable the patient to resume a normal lifestyle and to lower the risk of a heart attack. The decision to perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a complex one, and there is some disagreement among experts as to when it is indicated. Many experts feel that it has been performed too frequently in the Unit- ed States. According to the American Heart Association, appropriate candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery include patients with blockages in at least three major coronary arteries, especially if the blockages are in arteries that feed the heart\u2019s left ventricle; patients with angina so severe that even mild exertion causes chest pain; and patients who cannot tolerate percutaneous trans- luminal coronary angioplasty and do not respond well to drug therapy. It is well accepted that coronary artery bypass graft surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with severe coronary artery disease (three or more dis- eased arteries with impaired function in the left ventricle). Precautions Coronary artery bypass graft surgery should ideally be postponed for three months after a heart attack. Patients should be medically stable before the surgery, if possible. Description Coronary artery bypass graft surgery builds a detour around one or more blocked coronary arteries with a graft from a healthy vein or artery. The graft goes around the clogged artery (or arteries) to create new pathways for oxygen-rich blood to flow to the heart. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is major surgery performed in a hospital. The length of the procedure depends upon the number of arteries being bypassed, but it generally takes from four to six hours\u2014sometimes longer. The average hospital stay is four to seven days. Full recov- ery from coronary artery bypass graft surgery takes three to four months. Within four to six weeks, people with seden- tary office jobs can return to work; people with physical jobs must wait longer and sometimes change careers. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is widely per- formed in the United States. The American Heart Associ- ation estimates that 573,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries were performed on 363,000 patients in 1995. Seventy-four percent of these procedures were per- formed on men and 44% on men and women under the age of 65 (1995 data). The estimated average cost of this procedure in 1995 was $44,820.

Laith Farid Gulli, M.D. Fish and shellfish poisoning Definition Fish and shellfish poisoning is a common but often unrecognized group of illnesses related to food. Three of these illnesses include ciguatera, scombroid, and paralyt- ic shellfish poisoning. Ciguatera Definition Ciguatera (from the Spanish word for a poisonous snail) is a food-related illness that causes abdominal and neurological symptoms. Causes and symptoms Ciguatera is caused by eating fish that have a toxin called ciguatoxin. Scientists believe this toxin is acquired by the fish through the food chain, and is originally pro- duced by small algae microorganisms (dinoflagellates). The fish most likely contaminated with ciguatoxin are those that feed close to tropical reefs, including red snap- per, grouper, and barracuda. Larger fish are more likely to contain the toxin. Although not as common in the United States, ciguatera is commonly diagnosed on many of the islands in the Pacific Ocean. Illness from ciguatera can occur in just a few min- utes to about 30 hours after eating. Most cases occur one to six hours after eating the contaminated fish. Initial symptoms are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, or watery diarrhea . The most characteristic symptoms of the illness are those involving the nervous system. These include numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue, and mouth; itching ; dry mouth ; metallic taste in the mouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases, patients may complain of temporary blindness, a slow pulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patients may also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot and cold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel very hot or painful to the touch. In very severe cases, there may be difficulties in breathing or low blood pressure. Diagnosis Ciguatera diagnosis is based on the typical combina- tion of symptoms after eating fish. There are no readily available blood or urine tests to detect the poisoning, but some researchers have developed a test for the toxin left on any remaining fish. A person does not have to be in a tropical area to get ciguatera. Fish can be caught from one of these distant areas, and can then be shipped and eaten locally. It is important to report suspected cases to local public health officials because more cases may occur from other contaminated fish. Treatment The treatment for this illness is general. Patients are given fluids (by mouth or through a vein) and medica- tions to decrease the itching or to treat vomiting and/or diarrhea. The neurological symptoms can cause discom- fort and treatment with amitriptyline (a medicine that has been used for depression) may be useful. Other medica- tions may also be given. Prognosis Although death can occur, almost all patients diag- nosed with ciguatera will recover. Recovery, however, can be slow and some symptoms can last for weeks or even months. Symptoms can also be aggravated by other illnesses or alcohol. Prevention Knowing the kinds of fish linked to ciguatera can help a person avoid eating high-risk fish. However, over 400 different kinds of fish have been linked to the dis- ease, even salmon. A particular fish in a given area may be more likely to cause ciguatera than other fish. For example, red snapper is most often the source of ciguat- era in the Pacific, while barracuda is more likely to con- tain the toxin in Florida. This is why it is illegal to sell barracuda in Florida for human consumption. Cooking the fish does not prevent ciguatera. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1334 Fish and shellfish poisoning",

          "content": "Scombroid Definition Scombroid is a fish-associated illness caused by eat- ing improperly handled fish. Fish linked to this disease are usually in the Scombridae family, which includes yel- lowfin tuna, skipjack, bonito, and mackerel. Causes and symptoms Scombroid occurs after eating fish that has not been properly refrigerated after capture. Unlike ciguat- era, the toxins linked with scombroid are not contracted by the fish from its surroundings. Bacteria that are nor- mally found in fish act directly on a chemical (called histidine) in the flesh of fish that are not properly cooled when stored. This interaction produces hista- mine and other chemicals that cause the illness when the fish is eaten. Symptoms of scombroid occur quickly after eating the fish, as soon as 10 minutes. Since histamine is released by certain cells in the body during an allergic reaction, scombroid can be confused with a fish allergy. Scombroid causes flushing of the face, sweating, a burn- ing feeling in the mouth or throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches. A rash that looks like a sunburn may occur, and a small number of patients have hives. Some patients have a metallic or peppery taste in their mouths. In more severe cases, rapid pulse, blurred vision, and dif- ficulty breathing can occur. Symptoms usually last about four hours. Diagnosis Like ciguatera, scombroid poisoning is diagnosed based on typical symptoms occurring after eating fish. There are usually no available tests for the patient. Experimentally, however, elevated levels of histamine- related products have been found in the urine. It may be possible for public health officials to test any remaining fish flesh for histamine levels. Improperly refrigerated fish caught in both temperate and tropical waters have been linked to the illness. An outbreak of similar cases may be helpful in correctly diagnosing the problem. Treatment The treatment for scombroid is usually general. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may shorten the duration of the illness, but the illness will go away on its own. Some doctors have found that cimeti- dine (Tagamet) given through a vein may be helpful as well. In rare, more severe cases, epinephrine (adrenaline) may be used. KEY TERMS Algae\u2014Plants that have one cell. Histamine \u2014A chemical found naturally in the body that produces inflammation and increases blood flow; the uncomfortable symptoms of an allergy attack or an allergic reaction are generally caused by the release of histamine. Toxin\u2014A poisonous substance usually produced by a living thing. Prognosis Although sometimes dramatic and alarming symptoms can occur, scombroid is usually not serious. The patient should be reassured that scombroid is not a fish allergy. Prevention Adequate storage of the target fish will always pre- vent scombroid. Since the fish does not appear spoiled or smell bad, the consumer cannot detect the risk of the ill- ness before eating the fish. Cooking the fish does not pre- vent scombroid. Suspected cases should be reported to public health officials. Paralytic shellfish poisoning Definition Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a nervous system disease caused by eating cooked or raw shellfish that con- tain environmental toxins. These toxins are produced by a group of algae (dinoflagellates). It is unclear whether these toxins are related to the \u201cblooming\u201d of the algae, also called red tide because the algae can turn the water reddish brown. PSP occurs mostly in May through November. Causes and symptoms PSP develops usually within minutes after eating a contaminated shellfish, most commonly a mussel, clam, or oyster. Symptoms include headache, a floating feel- ing, dizziness , lack of coordination, and tingling of the mouth, arms, or legs. Muscle weakness causing difficulty swallowing or speaking may occur. Abdominal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can also occur. Unlike ciguatera and scombroid, PSP may have a much more serious outcome. PSP may cause difficulty breath- ing related to weakness or paralysis of the breathing muscle. The symptoms may last for six to 12 hours, but a patient may continue to feel weak for a week or more.

          "content": "Diagnosis PSP diagnosis is based on symptoms after eating shellfish, even if the shellfish are adequately cooked. No blood or urine test is available to diagnose the illness, but tests in mice to detect the toxin from the eaten fish can be done by public health officials. Treatment The treatment of PSP is mostly supportive. If early symptoms are recognized, the doctor will try to flush the toxin from the gastrointestinal tract with medications that create diarrhea. V omiting may be induced if the patient has no signs of weakness. In cases where the muscles of breathing are weakened, the patient may be placed on a respirator until the weakness goes away. However, this measure is not usually needed. Likewise, the use of a machine to clean the blood (dialysis) has been used in severe cases. Prognosis The prognosis for PSP is quite good, especially if the patient has passed the initial 12 hours of illness with- out needing breathing support. Most deaths occur during this period if breathing help is not available. Prevention Measures to control PSP require detecting rising numbers of algae in coastal waters by periodic micro- scopic examination. By law, shellfish beds are closed when levels of the toxin-producing organisms are above acceptable standards. Cooking the shellfish does not pre- vent this disease. Suspected cases should be reported to public health officials. Resources PERIODICALS Barton, Erik D., Paula Tanner, Steven G.

This tissue death, called necrosis or gangrene, spreads rapidly. This disease can be fatal in as little as 12 to 24 hours. Description Although the term is technically incorrect, flesh-eat- ing disease is an apt descriptor: the infection appears to devour body tissue. Media reports increased in the mid- dle and late 1990s, but the disease is not new. Hip- pocrates described it more than three millennia ago and thousands of reports exist from the Civil War. Approxi- mately 500 to 1,500 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur in the United States each year. Flesh-eating disease is divided into two types. Type I is caused by anaerobic bacteria, with or without the pres- ence of aerobic bacteria. Type II, also called hemolytic streptococcal gangrene, is caused by group A streptococ- ci; other bacteria may or may not be present. The disease may also be called synergistic gangrene. Type I fasciitis typically affects the trunk, abdomen, and genital area. For example, Fournier\u2019s gangrene is a \u201cflesh-eating\u201d disease in which the infection encompass- es the external genitalia. The arms and legs are most often affected in type II fasciitis, but the infection may appear anywhere. Causes and symptoms The two most important factors in determining whether or not a person will develop flesh-eating disease are: the virulence (ability to cause disease) of the bacteria and the susceptibility (ability of a person\u2019s immune sys- tem to respond to infection) of the person who becomes infected with this bacteria. In nearly every case of flesh-eating disease, a skin injury precedes the disease. As bacteria grow beneath the skin\u2019s surface, they produce toxins. These toxins destroy superficial fascia, subcutaneous fat, and deep fascia. In some cases, the overlying dermis and the underlying muscle are also affected. Initially, the infected area appears red and swollen and feels hot. The area is extremely painful, which is a prominent feature of the disease. Over the course of hours or days, the skin may become blue-gray, and fluid- filled blisters may form. As nerves are destroyed the area GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21336 Flesh-eating disease",

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test.

Secondary encephalitis may occur with measles, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and EBV . In secondary encephalitis, symptoms usually begin five to 10 days after the onset of the disease itself and are related to the break- down of the myelin sheath that covers nerve fibers. In rare cases, encephalitis may follow vaccination against some of the viral diseases listed above. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a very rare brain disorder caused by an infectious particle called a prion, may also cause encephalitis. Mosquitoes spread viruses responsible for equine encephalitis (eastern and western types), St. Louis encephalitis, California encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis . Lyme disease, spread by ticks, can cause encephalitis, as can Colorado tick fever. Rabies is most often spread by animal bites from dogs, cats, mice, rac- coons, squirrels, and bats and may cause encephalitis. Equine encephalitis is carried by mosquitoes that do not normally bite humans but do bite horses and birds. It is occasionally picked up from these animals by mosqui- toes that do bite humans. Japanese encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis are also carried by mosquitoes. The risk of contracting a mosquito-borne virus is greatest in mid- to late summer, when mosquitoes are most active, in those rural areas where these viruses are known to exist. Eastern equine encephalitis occurs in eastern and southeastern United States; western equine and Califor- nia encephalitis occur throughout the West; and St. Louis encephalitis occurs throughout the country. Japanese encephalitis does not occur in the United States, but is found throughout much of Asia. The viruses responsible for these diseases are classified as arbovirus and these diseases are collectively called arbovirus encephalitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis, the most common form of sporadic encephalitis in western countries, is a disease with significantly high mortality. It occurs in children and adults and both sides of the brain are affected. It is theo- rized that brain infection is caused by the virus moving from a peripheral location to the brain via two nerves, the olfactory and the trigeminal (largest nerves in the skull). Herpes simplex encephalitis is responsible for 10% of all encephalitis cases and is the main cause of spo- radic, fatal encephalitis. In untreated patients, the rate of death is 70% while the mortality is 15\u201320% in patients who have been treated with acyclovir. The symptoms of herpes simplex encephalitis are fever, rapidly disintegrat- ing mental state, headache, and behavioral changes. Symptoms The symptoms of encephalitis range from very mild to very severe and may include: \u2022 headache \u2022f e v e r \u2022 lethargy (sleepiness, decreased alertness, and fatigue) \u2022 malaise \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 visual disturbances \u2022 tremor \u2022 decreased consciousness (drowsiness, confusion, delir- ium, and unconsciousness) \u2022 stiff neck \u2022 seizures Symptoms may progress rapidly, changing from mild to severe within several days or even several hours. Diagnosis Diagnosis of encephalitis includes careful question- ing to determine possible exposure to viral sources. Tests that can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other disorders include: \u2022 Blood tests. These are to detect antibodies to viral anti- gens, and foreign proteins. \u2022 Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (spinal tap). This detects viral antigens, and provides culture specimens for the virus or bacteria that may be present in the cere- brospinal fluid. \u2022 Electroencephalogram (EEG). \u2022 CT and MRI scans. A brain biopsy (surgical gathering of a small tissue sample) may be recommended in some cases where treatment to date has been ineffective and the cause of the encephalitis is unclear. Definite diagnosis by biopsy may allow specific treatment that would otherwise be too risky. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1178 Encephalitis",

          "content": "Treatment Choice of treatment for encephalitis will depend on the cause. Bacterial encephalitis is treated with antibi- otics. Viral encephalitis is usually treated with antiviral drugs including acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, ribo- varin, and AZT. Viruses that respond to acyclovir include herpes simplex, the most common cause of sporadic (non-epidemic) encephalitis in the United States. The symptoms of encephalitis may be treated with a number of different drugs. Corticosteroids , including prednisone and dexamethasone, are sometimes pre- scribed to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. Anti- convulsant drugs, including dilantin and phenytoin, are used to control seizures. Fever may be reduced with acetaminophen or other fever-reducing drugs. A person with encephalitis must be monitored care- fully, since symptoms may change rapidly. Blood tests may be required regularly to track levels of fluids and salts in the blood. Prognosis Encephalitis symptoms may last several weeks. Most cases of encephalitis are mild, and recovery is usu- ally quick. Mild encephalitis usually leaves no residual neurological problems. Overall, approximately 10% of those with encephalitis die from their infections or com- plications such as secondary infection. Some forms of encephalitis have more severe courses, including herpes encephalitis, in which mortality is 15\u201320% with treat- ment, and 70\u201380% without. Antiviral treatment is inef- fective for eastern equine encephalitis, and mortality is approximately 30%. Permanent neurological consequences may follow recovery in some cases. Consequences may include per- sonality changes, memory loss, language difficulties, seizures, and partial paralysis. Prevention Because encephalitis is due to infection, it may be prevented by avoiding the infection. Minimizing contact with others who have any of the viral illness listed above may reduce the chances of becoming infected. Most infections are spread by hand-to-hand or hand-to-mouth contact; frequent hand washing may reduce the likeli- hood of infection if contact cannot be avoided. Mosquito-borne viruses may be avoided by prevent- ing mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk, and are most common in moist areas with standing water. Minimizing exposed skin and use of mosquito repellents on other areas can reduce the chances of being bitten. KEY TERMS Cerebrospinal fluid analysis \u2014A analysis that is important in diagnosing diseases of the central nervous system. The fluid within the spine will indicate the presence of viruses, bacteria, and blood. Infections such as encephalitis will be indi- cated by an increase of cell count and total pro- tein in the fluid. Computerized tomography (CT) Scan \u2014A test to examine organs within the body and detect evi- dence of tumors, blood clots, and accumulation of fluids. Electroencephalagram (EEG)\u2014A chart of the brain waves picked up by the electrodes placed on the scalp. Changes in brain wave activity can be an indication of nervous system disorders. Inflammation\u2014A response from the immune sys- tem to an injury. The signs are redness, heat, swelling, and pain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\u2014MRI is diag- nostic radiography using electromagnetic energy to create an image of the central nervous system (CNS), blood system, and musculoskeletal system. Vaccine\u2014A prepartation containing killed or weakened microorganisms used to build immuni- ty against infection from that microorganism. Virus\u2014A very small organism that can only live within a cell. They are unable to reproduce out- side that cell. Vaccines are available against some viruses, includ- ing polio, herpes B, Japanese encephalitis, and equine encephalitis. Rabies vaccine is available for animals; it is also given to people after exposure. Japanese encephalitis vaccine is recommended for those traveling to Asia and staying in affected rural areas during transmission season.

          "content": "Causes and symptoms Causes Congenital brain defects may have genetic, infec- tious, toxic, or traumatic causes. In most cases, no certain cause can be identified. GENETIC CAUSES. Some brain defects are caused by trisomy, the inclusion of a third copy of a chromosome normally occurring in pairs. Most trisomies occur because of improper division of the chromosomes during formation of eggs or sperm. Trisomy of chromosome 9 can cause some cases of Dandy-Walker and Chiari II malformation. Some cases of holoprosencephaly are caused by trisomy of chromosome 13, while others are due to abnormalities in chromosomes 7 or 18. Individual gene defects, either inherited or spontaneous, are respon- sible for other cases of congenital brain malformations. DRUGS. Drugs known to cause congenital brain defects when used by the mother during critical develop- mental periods include: \u2022 anticonvulsant drugs \u2022 retinoic acid and tretinoin \u2022 warfarin \u2022 alcohol \u2022 cocaine OTHER. Other causes of congenital brain defects include: \u2022 intrauterine infections, including cytomegalovirus, rubella, herpes simplex, and varicella zoster \u2022 maternal diabetes mellitus \u2022 maternal phenylketonuria \u2022 fetal trauma Symptoms Besides the features listed above, symptoms of con- genital brain defects may include: \u2022 Chiari II malformation: impaired swallowing and gag reflex, loss of the breathing reflex, facial paralysis , uncontrolled eye movements ( nystagmus ), impaired balance and gait. \u2022 Dandy-Walker malformation: symptoms of hydro- cephalus, lack of muscle tone or \u201cfloppiness,\u201d seizures, spasticity, deafness, irritability, visual impairment , deterioration of consciousness, paralysis. \u2022 Lissencephaly: lack of muscle tone, seizures, develop- mental delay, spasticity,cerebral palsy. \u2022 Hydranencephaly: irritability, spasticity, seizures, tem- perature oscillations. KEY TERMS Amniocentesis \u2014Removal of fluid from the sac surrounding a fetus for purposes of diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid \u2014Fluid produced within the brain for nutrient transport and structural purposes. CSF circulates through the ventricles, open spaces within the brain, and drains through the mem- branes surrounding the brain. Congenital\u2014Defect present at birth. Fetus\u2014The unborn human, developing in a woman\u2019s uterus, from the eighth week after fertil- ization to birth. \u2022 megalencephaly due to neurological or metabolic dis- ease: mental retardation, seizures. Diagnosis Congenital brain defects are diagnosed either from direct physical examinationor imaging studies including computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) scans. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be used to reveal characteristic abnormalities. Prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects causing anencephaly or meningomyelocele is possible through ultrasound examination and maternal blood testing for alpha-fetoprotein, which is almost always elevated. Ultrasound can also be used to diagnose Dandy-Walker and Chiari II malformations. Amniocentesis may reveal trisomies or other chromosomal abnormalities. Treatment Meningomyelocele may be treated with surgery to close the open portion of the spinal cord. Surgery for encephalocele is possible only if there is a minimal amount of brain tissue protruding. Malformations associ- ated with hydrocephalus (Dandy-Walker, Chiari II, and some cases of hydranencephaly) may be treated by installation of a drainage shunt for cerebrospinal fluid. Drugs may be used to treat some symptoms of brain defects, including seizures and spasticity. Prognosis Most congenital brain defects carry a very poor prog- nosis.

The antibiotics most commonly used are penicillin and vancomycin. Patients experiencing difficulty breathing are also given oxygen therapy. Surgical treatment of empyema has two goals: drainage of the infected fluid and closing up of the space left in the pleural cavity. If the infection is still in its early stages, the fluid can be drained by thoracentesis. In sec- ond-stage empyema, the surgeon will insert a chest tube in the patient\u2019s rib cage or remove part of a rib (rib resection) in order to drain the fluid. In third-stage empyema, the sur- geon may cut or peel away the thick fibrous layer coating the lung. This procedure is called decortication. When the fibrous covering is removed, the lung will expand to fill the space in the chest cavity. The doctor can use video- assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) techniques to position the chest tube or to perform a limited decortication. The V ATS technique allows a physician to see within the body during certain surgical procedures. Empyema of the gall- bladder is a serious condition that is treated with intra- venous antibiotics and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Prognosis The prognosis for recovery is generally good, except in those cases with complications, such as a brain abscess or blood poisoning , or cases caused by certain types of streptococci.

Brain inflammation caused by a bacterial infection is sometimes called cerebritis. When both the brain and spinal cord are involved, the disorder is called encephalomyelitis. An inflammation of the brain\u2019s covering, or meninges, is called meningitis. Description Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. The inflammation is a reaction of the body\u2019s immune system to infection or invasion. During the inflammation, the brain\u2019s tissues become swollen. The combination of the infection and the immune reaction to it can cause headache and a fever, as well as more severe symptoms in some cases. Approximately 2,000 cases of encephalitis are reported to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA each year. The viruses causing primary encephalitis can be epidemic or sporadic. The polio virus is an epi- demic cause. Arthropod-borne viral encephalitis is responsible for most epidemic viral encephalitis. The viruses live in animal hosts and mosquitos that transmit the disease. The most common form of non-epidemic or sporadic encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and has a high rate of death. Mumps is another example of a sporadic cause. Causes and symptoms Causes There are more than a dozen viruses that can cause encephalitis, spread by either human-to human contact or by animal bites. Encephalitis may occur with several common viral infections of childhood. Viruses and viral diseases that may cause encephalitis include: \u2022 chickenpox \u2022 measles \u2022 mumps \u2022 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1177 Encephalitis",

          "content": "Viruses are generally divided into those that use DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA as their genetic material; all enteroviruses are RNA viruses. They are found worldwide, but infection is more common in areas of poor hygiene and overcrowding. Although most cases of enterovirus do not produce symptoms, some five to 10 million individuals in the Unit- ed States each year suffer from one of the enteroviral dis- eases. Illness is more common in the very young. While there are close to seventy different strains of enteroviruses, over 70% of infections are caused by only 10 types. The virus is most commonly transmitted by the fecal-oral route (contamination of fingers or objects by human waste material); in some instances transmission is through contaminated food or water. Passage of some strains of virus by way of air droplets can lead to respira- tory illness. Infection of fetuses by way of the placenta has also been documented. Breast milk contains antibod- ies which can protect newborns. The incubation period for most enteroviruses ranges from two to 14 days. In areas of temperate climate, infec- tions occur mainly in the summer and fall. Causes and symptoms Enteroviruses are believed to be the cause of at least 10 distinct illnesses. Once they enter the body, they mul- tiply in the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract, and eventually reach sites of lymphatic tissue (such as the tonsils). While most of these diseases are of short dura- tion and do not cause significant injury, some can pro- duce severe illness. The main syndromes caused by the various entero- viruses are the following: \u2022 Summer grippe (nonspecific febrile illness). This is the most common syndrome, and is characterized by flu- like symptoms of fever, headache, and weakness, that typically last three to four days. Many patients also develop upper respiratory symptoms and some nausea and vomiting . One of the major ways to distinguish this disease from influenza, is the fact that grippe most often occurs in the summer. \u2022 Generalized disease of the newborn is a potentially serious infection in which infants from one week to three months of age develop a syndrome that can be difficult to distinguish from a severe bacterial infection. Fever, irritability, and decreased responsiveness or excessive sleepiness are the major symptoms. Inflam- mation of heart muscle ( myocarditis), low blood pres- sure, hepatitis, and meningitis sometimes complicate the illness. \u2022 Aseptic meningitis encephalitis is a well known syn- drome caused by this group of viruses. In fact, enteroviruses are responsible for over 90% of cases of aseptic meningitis, and most often hits children and young adults. Headache, fever, avoidance of light, and eye pain are characteristic. Drowsiness may be promi- nent, and other symptoms include sore throat, cough, muscle pain, and rash. Occasionally, not only the meninges\u2014the covering around the brain and spinal cord\u2014 is infected, but also brain tissue itself, produc- ing encephalitis. The illness resolves after about a week or so, and permanent damage is unusual. Enteroviruses can also produce the Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which involves weakness and paralysis of the extremities and even the muscles of respiration. \u2022 Pleurodynia (Bornholm\u2019s disease) is due to viral infec- tion and inflammation of the chest and abdominal mus- cles used for breathing. Pain occurs as acute episodes, lasting 30 minutes or so. Coxsackie B virus is the usual cause of the illness. \u2022 Myocarditis and/or pericarditis involves infection of the heart muscle (myocardium) and the covering around the heart (pericardium). Infants and young adults are the most susceptible, and for some reason, over two-thirds of cases occur in males. The disease usually begins as an upper respiratory tract infection with cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, irregularities of cardiac rhythm, and heart failure sometimes develop. Some patients wind up with long term heart failure if the heart muscle is significantly affected. \u2022 Exanthems is the medical term for rashes, and enterovirus is the number one cause of summer and fall rashes in children. They occur anywhere on the body, and often resemble diseases such as measles. \u2022 Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs initially as a sore throat (often involving the tongue as well), and is fol- lowed by a rash on the hands, and sometimes the feet. The rash often forms small blisters, which lead to ulcers. Symptoms generally resolve within a week. A specific Coxsackievirus (A16) is the most frequent cause of this highly infectious disease. \u2022 Herpangina is most often caused by one of the Cox- sackie A viruses, and appears as the acute onset of fever and sore throat. This last symptom is particularly severe, as the virus produces multiple ulcers in the throat. Swallowing becomes very painful; symptoms can persist for several weeks. \u2022 Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis involves viral infec- tion of the conjunctiva, which is a covering around the eye. Pain, blurred vision, aversion to light, and a dis- charge from the eye are the main symptoms. Headache GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1212 Enterovirus infections",

It is also possible for enterobacterial infections to spread by person-to-person contact. The usual incubation period is 12\u201372 hours. ESCHERICHIA COLI INFECTIONS. E. coli infections cause most of the enterobacterial infections in the United States. The organisms are categorized according to whether they are invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive types of E. coli include what are called enteropathogenic E. coli, or EPEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, or ETEC. EPEC and ETEC types produce a bacterial poison (toxin) in the stomach that interacts with the digestive juices and causes the patient to lose large amounts of water through the intestines. The invasive types of E. coli are called enterohemor- rhagic E. coli , or EHEC, and enteroinvasive E. coli, or EIEC. These subtypes invade the stomach tissues direct- ly, causing tissue destruction and bloody stools. EHEC can produce complications leading to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially fatal disorder marked by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure. EHEC has become a growing problem in the United States because of outbreaks caused by contaminated food. A particular type of EHEC known as O157:H7 has been identified since 1982 in undercooked hamburgers, unpasteurized milk, and apple juice. Between 2\u20137% of infections caused by O157:H7 develop into HUS. Symptoms The symptoms of enterobacterial infections are sometimes classified according to the type of diarrhea they produce. WATERY DIARRHEA. Patients infected with ETEC, EPEC, some types of Salmonella, and some types of Shigella develop a watery diarrhea. These infections are located in the small intestine, result from bacterial toxins interacting with digestive juices, do not produce inflamma- tion, and do not usually need treatment with antibiotics. BLOODY DIARRHEA (DYSENTERY). Bloody diarrhea is sometimes called dysentery. It is produced by EHEC, EIEC, some types of Salmonella, some types of Shigella, and Yersinia. In dysentery, the infection is located in the colon, cells and tissues are destroyed, inflammation is present, and antibiotic therapy is usually required. NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS (NEC). Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disorder that begins in newborn infants shortly after birth. Although NEC is not yet fully understood, it is thought that it results from a bacterial or viral invasion of damaged intestinal tissues. The disease organisms then cause the death (necrosis) of bowel tis- sue or gangrene of the bowel. NEC is primarily a disease of prematurity ; 60\u201380% of cases occur in high-risk preterm infants. NEC is responsible for 2\u20135% of cases in newborn intensive care units (NICU). Enterobacteriaceae that have been identified in infants with NEC include Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Diagnosis Patient history The diagnosis of enterobacterial infections is com- plicated by the fact that viruses, protozoa, and other types of bacteria can also cause diarrhea. In most cases of mild diarrhea, it is not critical to identify the organism because the disorder is self-limiting. Some groups of patients, however, should have stool tests. They include: \u2022 patients with bloody diarrhea, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea who have become dehy- drated, \u2022 patients with watery diarrhea that has lasted longer than three days without decreasing in amount, \u2022 patients with disorders of the immune system. The patient history is useful for public health reasons as well as helping the doctor determine what type of enterobacterium may be causing the infection. The doctor will ask about the frequency and appearance of the diar- rhea as well as other digestive symptoms. If the patient is nauseated and vomiting, the infection is more likely to be located in the small intestine. If the patient is running a fever, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. The doctor will also ask if anyone else in the patient\u2019s family or workplace is sick. Some types of enterobacteriaceae are more likely to cause group outbreaks than others. Other questions include the patient\u2019s food intake over the last few days and whether he or she has recently traveled to countries with typhoid fever or cholera outbreaks. Physical examination The most important parts of the physical examina- tion are checking for signs of severe fluid loss and exam- ining the abdomen to rule out typhoid fever. The doctor will look at the inside of the patient\u2019s mouth and evaluate the skin for signs of dehydration. The presence of a skin rash and an enlarged spleen suggests typhoid rather than a bacterial infection. If the patient\u2019s abdomen hurts when the doctor examines it, a diagnosis of dysentery is more likely. Laboratory tests The most common test that is used to identify the cause of diarrhea is the stool test. Examining a stool sam- ple under a microscope can help to rule out parasitic and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1205 Enterobacterial infections",

          "content": "Description Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feel- ings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical and mental deterioration, they become what are known as depressive disorders. Each year in the United States, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17 million people at an approximate annual direct and indirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like- ly to experience an episode of severe depression in her lifetime, with a 10\u201320% lifetime prevalence, com- pared to 5\u201310% for men. The average age a first depressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, although the disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately, from children to the elderly. There are two main categories of depressive disor- ders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depressive disorder is a moderate to severe episode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi- viduals experiencing this major depressive episode may have trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they once took pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif- ficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, or have a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children, the major depression may appear as irritability. While major depressive episodes may be acute (intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo- ing, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (one or more years in children) and has an average duration of 16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymic disorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflicted with the disorder may experience some periods of nor- mal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length. Its onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not be able to pinpoint exactly when they started feeling depressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder may experience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, low self-esteem, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness. Depression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n affective mental illness that causes radical emotional changes and mood swings, from manic highs to depres- sive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. Causes and symptoms The causes behind depression are complex and not yet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu- rotransmitters\u2014the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cell\u2014 is believed to be key to depression, external factors such as upbringing (more so in dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor- tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is abused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles- cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking may emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depression may follow. Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops depressive disorders. Individuals with major depression in their immediate family are up to three times more likely to have the disorder themselves. It would seem that biological and genetic factors may make certain individuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor- ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig- ger the disorder. External stressors and significant life changes, such as chronic medical problems, death of a loved one, divorce or estrangement, miscarriage , or loss of a job, can also result in a form of depression known as adjust- ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder usually resolve themselves, occasionally they may evolve into a major depressive disorder. Major depressive episode Individuals experiencing a major depressive episode have a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest or pleasure in activities. Children experiencing a major depressive episode may appear or feel irritable rather than depressed. In addition, five or more of the following symptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri- od of at least two weeks: \u2022 Significant change in weight. \u2022 Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep). \u2022 Psychomotor agitation or retardation. \u2022 Fatigue or loss of energy. \u2022 Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt. \u2022 Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci- siveness. \u2022 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal and/or suicide attempts.

Prognosis Untreated or improperly treated depression is the number one cause of suicide in the United States. Proper treatment relieves symptoms in 80\u201390% of depressed patients. After each major depressive episode, the risk of recurrence climbs significantly\u201450% after one episode, 70% after two episodes, and 90% after three episodes. For this reason, patients need to be aware of the symp- toms of recurring depression and may require long-term maintenance treatment of antidepressants and/or therapy. Prevention Patient education in the form of therapy or self-help groups is crucial for training patients with depressive dis- orders to recognize symptoms of depression and to take an active part in their treatment program. Extended main- tenance treatment with antidepressants may be required in some patients to prevent relapse. Early intervention with children with depression is effective in arresting development of more severe problems. Resources BOOKS American Psychiatric Association.

          "content": "Dysthymic disorder Dysthymia commonly occurs in tandem with other psychiatric and physical conditions. Up to 70% of dys- thymic patients have both dysthymic disorder and major depressive disorder, known as double depression. Sub- stance abuse, panic disorders, personality disorders , social phobias, and other psychiatric conditions are also found in many dysthymic patients. Dysthymia is prevalent in patients with certain medical conditions, including mul- tiple sclerosis, AIDS, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and post-car- diac transplantation. The connection between dysthymic disorder and these medical conditions is unclear, but it may be related to the way the medical condition and/or its pharmacological treatment affects neurotransmitters. Dys- thymic disorder can lengthen or complicate the recovery of patients also suffering from medical conditions. Along with an underlying feeling of depression, people with dysthymic disorder experience two or more of the following symptoms on an almost daily basis for a period for two or more years (most suffer for five years), or one year or more for children: \u2022 under or overeating \u2022 insomnia or hypersomnia \u2022 low energy or fatigue \u2022 low self-esteem \u2022 poor concentration or trouble making decisions \u2022 feelings of hopelessness Diagnosis In addition to an interview, several clinical invento- ries or scales may be used to assess a patient\u2019s mental status and determine the presence of depressive symp- toms. Among these tests are: the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Child Depression Inventory (CDI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Zung Self-Rating Scale for Depression. These tests may be administered in an out- patient or hospital setting by a general practitioner, social worker, psychiatrist, or psychologist. Treatment Major depressive and dysthymic disorders are typi- cally treated with antidepressants or psychosocial thera- py. Psychosocial therapy focuses on the personal and interpersonal issues behind depression, while antidepres- sant medication is prescribed to provide more immediate relief for the symptoms of the disorder. When used together correctly, therapy and antidepressants are a powerful treatment plan for the depressed patient. Antidepressants Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) reduce depression by increasing levels of serotonin, a neuro- transmitter. Some clinicians prefer SSRIs for treatment of dysthymic disorder. Anxiety , diarrhea , drowsiness, headache , sweating, nausea, poor sexual functioning, and insomnia are all possible side effects of SSRIs. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are less expensive than SSRIs, but have more severe side-effects, which may include persistent dry mouth, sedation, dizziness , and cardiac arrhythmias. Because of these side effects, cau- tion is taken when prescribing TCAs to elderly patients. TCAs include amitriptyline (Elavil), imipramine (Tofra- nil), and nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor).

The most important part of diagnosis is determining the cause of the delirium. Tests may include blood and urine analysis for levels of drugs, fluids, elec- trolytes, and blood gases, and to test for infection; lum- bar puncture (\u201cspinal tap\u201d) to test for central nervous system infection; x ray, computed tomography scans (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for tumors, hemorrhage, or other brain abnormali- ty; thyroid tests; electroencephalography (EEG); elec- trocardiography (ECG); and possibly others as dictated by the likely cause. Treatment Treatment of delirium begins with recognizing and treating the underlying cause. Delirium itself is managed by reducing disturbing stimuli, or providing soothing ones; use of simple, clear language in communication; and reassurance, especially from family members. Physi- cal restraints may be needed if the patient is a danger to himself or others, or if he insists on removing necessary medical equipment such as intravenous lines or monitors. Sedatives or antipsychotic drugs may be used to reduce anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions. Prognosis Persons with delirium usually have a worse prog- nosis for the underlying disease than the person with- out delirium. Nonetheless, those without terminal ill- ness usually recover from delirium. They may not, however, regain all their original cognitive abilities, and may be left with some permanent impairments, including fatigue , irritability, difficulty concentrating, or mood changes. Prevention Prevention of delirium is focused on treating or avoiding its underlying causes. The most preventable forms are those induced by drugs. Strategies for reducing delirium include following prescriptions, consulting the prescribing physician immediately if symptoms occur, and consulting the physician before discontinuing the drug, even if it has been ineffective; avoiding intoxica- tion with legal or illegal drugs, and seeking professional assistance before suddenly discontinuing an addictive drug such as alcohol or heroin; maintaining good nutri- tion, which promotes general health and can minimize the likelihood of delirium from alcohol intoxication and withdrawal; and avoiding exposure to solvents, insecti- cides, heavy metals, or biological poisons in the home or workplace.

These irrational beliefs defy normal reasoning, and remain firm even when overwhelming proof is pre- sented to dispute them. Delusions are often accompanied by hallucinations and/or feelings of paranoia , which act to strengthen confidence in the delusion. Delusions are distinct from culturally or religiously based beliefs that may be seen as untrue by outsiders. Description Delusions are a common symptom of several mood and personality-related mental illnesses, including schizoaffective disorder , schizophrenia , shared psy- chotic disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder . They are also the major feature of delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder suffer from long-term, complex delusions that fall into one of six categories: persecutory, grandiose, jealousy, ero- tomanic, somatic, or mixed. There are also delusional disorders such as dementia that clearly have organic or physical causes. Persecutory Individuals with persecutory delusional disorder are plagued by feelings of paranoia and an irrational yet unshakable belief that someone is plotting against them, or out to harm them.

Holly Ann Ishmael, MS Crib death see Sudden infant death syndrome Crohn\u2019s disease Definition Crohn\u2019s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel dis- ease (IBD), resulting in swelling and dysfunction of the intestinal tract. Description Crohn\u2019s disease involves inflammation of the intes- tine, especially the small intestine. Inflammation refers to swelling, redness, and loss of normal function. There is evidence that the inflammation is caused by various products of the immune system that attack the body itself instead of helpfully attacking a foreign invader (a virus or bacteria, for example). The inflammation of Crohn\u2019s disease most commonly affects the last part of the ileum (a section of the small intestine), and often includes the large intestine (the colon). However, inflammation may also occur in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting the mouth, esophagus, or stomach. Crohn\u2019s dis- ease differs from ulcerative colitis, the other major type of IBD, in two important ways: \u2022 The inflammation of Crohn\u2019s disease may be discontin- uous, meaning that areas of involvement in the intestine may be separated by normal, unaffected segments of intestine. The affected areas are called \u201cregional enteri- tis,\u201d while the normal areas are called \u201cskip areas.\u201d \u2022 The inflammation of Crohn\u2019s disease affects all the lay- ers of the intestinal wall, while ulcerative colitis affects only the lining of the intestine. Also, ulcerative colitis does not usually involve the small intestine; in rare cases it involves the terminal ileum (so-called \u201cbackwash\u201d ileitis). In addition to inflammation, Crohn\u2019s disease causes ulcerations, or irritated pits in the intestinal wall. These pits occur because the inflammation has made areas of tissue shed. Crohn\u2019s disease may be diagnosed at any age, although most diagnoses are made between the ages of 15\u201335. About 0.02\u20130.04% of the population suffers from this disorder, with men and women having an equal chance of being stricken. Whites are more frequently affected than other racial groups, and people of Jewish ori- gin are between three and six times more likely to suffer from IBD. IBD runs in families; an IBD patient has a 20% chance of having other relatives who are fellow sufferers. Crohn\u2019s disease is a chronic disorder. While the symptoms can be improved, a patient will not be com- pletely cured of the underlying disease. Causes and symptoms The cause of Crohn\u2019s disease is unknown. No infec- tious agent (virus, bacteria, or fungi) has been identified as the cause of Crohn\u2019s disease. Still, some researchers have theorized that some type of infection may have originally been responsible for triggering the immune system, resulting in the continuing and out-of-control cycle of inflammation that occurs in Crohn\u2019s disease. Other evidence for a disorder of the immune system includes the high incidence of other immune disorders that may occur along with Crohn\u2019s disease. The first symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease include diar- rhea, fever, abdominal pain, inability to eat, weight loss, and fatigue. Some patients have severe pain that mimics appendicitis. It is rare, however, for patients to notice blood in their bowel movements.

Streptococcus \u2014A bacteria that causes erysipelas and strep throat, as well as other infections. bacteria is responsible for such infections as strep throat, and infections of both surgical and other kinds of wounds in the skin. The infection occurs most often in young infants and the elderly. Causes and symptoms Erysipelas usually occurs rather abruptly. When the preceding infection was strep throat, the rash begins on the face. Occasionally, when the preceding infection was of a wound from an injury or operation, the rash will appear on an arm or leg. Classically, the usual presentation is a bright-red, butterfly-shaped rash appearing across the bridge of the nose and the cheeks. It is hot to the touch, painful, shiny, and swollen, with clearly defined margins. The edges of the rash are a raised ridge, hard to the touch. There may be fluid-filled bumps scattered along the area. The rash spreads rapidly. Some patients have swelling of the eye- lids, sometimes so severe that their eyes swell shut. The patient may have fever, chills, loss of energy, nausea and vomiting , and swollen, tender lymph nodes. In severe cases, walled-off areas of pus (abscesses) may develop beneath the skin. If left untreated, the strepto- coccal bacteria may begin circulating in the bloodstream (a condition called bacteremia ). A patient may then develop an overwhelming, systemic infection called sep- sis, with a high risk of death. Diagnosis The rash of erysipelas is very characteristic, raising the practitioner\u2019s suspicion towards that diagnosis, espe- cially when coupled with a history of recent strep infec- tion. Attempts to culture (grow) the bacteria from a sam- ple of the rash usually fail. When the bacteria are present in the blood, they may be grown in a laboratory, and identified under a microscope. Other laboratory tests involve reacting fluorescently-tagged antibodies with a sample of the patient\u2019s infected tissue. This type of test may be successful in positively identifying the strepto- coccal bacteria. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1225 Erysipelas",

In addition, Epstein-Barr virus testing is usually not needed in the evaluation of a patient who has long-last- ing fatigue , and may have the chronic fatigue syn- drome. Initially, it was thought that discovering a partic- ular pattern of antibodies to this virus was helpful in the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, but this no longer appears to be the case. Precautions As in any blood test, standard precautions should be performed to prevent infection at the site where the blood is obtained, and to prevent excess bleeding. Normally, the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the blood being obtained; a sterile non-reusable needle and syringe are used; and, once the needle is removed, pres- sure is placed at the site until bleeding has stopped. Description These tests are more often performed in a consulting laboratory than at a physician\u2019s office or in a hospital laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the whole blood is allowed to clot in a tube. Antibodies can be detected against several components of the Epstein- Barr virus (EBV). These components are the EBV early antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif- ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages) of the virus\u2019 growth. At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus, antibodies to EA are found and usually last for four to six months only. This antibody, however, persists substan- tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti- body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV occurred in the past. Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA can be found. Unlike antibodies to EA and VCA, antibody to EBNA does not usually develop until recovery from first time infection of this virus. Therefore, finding detectable amounts of antibody to EBNA during an illness which might be caused by EBV makes the causal relationship very unlikely. Preparation The skin area from which the blood sample will be obtained is wiped with an antiseptic such as alcohol or iodine. Aftercare The aftercare is similar to that for any blood test. Usually, pressure is applied to the area for several moments until bleeding stops. If the results are difficult to interpret, it may be necessary to re-test later, after waiting one to three weeks. The change in the amounts of antibody detected between the two tests can be particu- larly useful, at times, in helping to make a diagnosis. Risks There are no risks over and above those of having blood drawn for any other purpose. These tests are more expensive than many other blood tests but are usually covered by medical insurance. Normal results The pattern of the three antibodies can be used to determine whether the person has not had infection with EBV to this point (is susceptible to infection); is current- ly, or recently, infected with EBV for the first time; or has had first time infection with EBV sometime in the past (more than six months ago). If one defines \u201cnormal\u201d results as either not having EBV in the past, and call that category one; or having had it in the past, and call that category two. Most young children below the age of five will fall into category one, while most adults over the age of 20 years will fall into category two. The results for susceptibility are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA (either IgM or IgG) = negative \u2022 antibody to EBNA = Negative The results for past infection are: \u2022 antibody to EA = negative (90% of time) \u2022 antibody to VCA IgM = negative \u2022 antibody to VCA IgG = positive \u2022 antibody to EBNA = positive It is important to realize that the Epstein-Barr virus, like all the human herpes viruses, does not totally leave the body after the patient recovers from illness.

Purpose The test is primarily used to detect whether first time infection (called primary infection) with the Epstein-Barr virus is currently occurring, or has occurred within a short period of time. The pattern of the antibodies detect- ed can, however, tell if the person has never been infect- ed with the Epstein-Barr virus, or if the infection occurred in the more distant past. These tests are mostly utilized in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis when the more common diag- nostic test, the heterophile antibody, is negative, or in sit- uations where the infection is manifesting unusual symp- toms.

CFS has so many names because researchers have been unable to find out exactly what causes it and because there are many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869. Later, people with simi- lar symptoms were said to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be overlapping syndromes. In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors found that many people with CFS had high levels of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned out that many healthy people also had high EBV antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other viral antibodies in the blood of people with CFS. These findings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or combination of viruses may trigger CFS. CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class profession- als. In fact, CFS can affect people of any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with CFS are 25\u201345 years old, and about 80% of cases are in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the dif- ficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that four to 10 peo- ple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. Causes and symptoms There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies have pointed to several different conditions that might be responsible. These include: \u2022 viral infections \u2022 chemical toxins \u2022 allergies \u2022 immune abnormalities \u2022 psychological disorders Although the cause is still controversial, many doc- tors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and damages the immune system, allow- ing dormant viruses to become active. About 90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start growing again, the immune system may overreact and produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies of people with CFS, although the same abnormalities are also found in people with allergies, autoimmune dis- eases, cancer, and other disorders. The role of psychological problems in CFS is very controversial. Because many people with CFS are diag- nosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are psychological. However, many people with CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients become depressed or anxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was not its cause. Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired. Peo- ple with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them from performing their normal daily activities. They find it dif- ficult or impossible to work, attend school, or even to take part in social activities. They may have sleep distur- bances that keep them from getting enough rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with CFS feel just as tired after a full night\u2019s sleep as before they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience what some patients call \u201cpayback\u201d\u2014debilitating exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days. Other symptoms of CFS include: \u2022 muscle pain (myalgia) \u2022 joint pain (arthralgia) \u2022 sore throat \u2022 headache \u2022 fever and chills \u2022 tender lymph nodes \u2022 trouble concentrating \u2022 memory loss A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 patients with CFS.

When treat- ed with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure, many patients in the study had marked improvements in their CFS symptoms. Diagnosis CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim- inating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques- tion patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses they have had, and medications they are taking. They also conduct a physical examination , neurological examination, and laboratory tests to identify any underly- ing disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the United States, many doctors use the CDC case definition to determine if a patient has CFS. To be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both of the following criteria: \u2022 Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue for at least six months that is of new or definite onset, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly relieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational, social, or personal activities to be greatly reduced. \u2022 Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short- term memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following exercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more than 24 hours. These symptoms must have continued or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must not have started before the fatigue began. Treatment There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments usual- ly are individualized to each person\u2019s particular symp- toms and needs. The first treatment most doctors recom- mend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a balanced diet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and resting when needed are key to maintaining existing energy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to keep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too much exercise can worsen fatigue and other CFS symp- toms. Counseling and stress reduction techniques also may help some people with CFS. Many medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal preparations have been used to treat CFS.

          "content": "Description Chancroid is an infection of the genitals that is caused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi . Chan- croid is a sexually transmitted disease, which means that it is spread from person to person almost always by sexu- al contact. However, there have been a few cases in which healthcare providers have become infected through contact with infected patients. Common locations for chancroid sores (ulcers) in men are the shaft or head of the penis, foreskin, the groove behind the head of the penis, the opening of the penis, and the scrotum. In women, common locations are the labia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips), perianal area (area around the anal opening), and inner thighs. It is rare for the ulcer(s) to be on the vaginal walls or cervix. In about 50% of the patients with chancroid, the infection spreads to either or both of the lymph nodes in the groin. Chancroid is most commonly found in developing and third world countries. In the United States, the most common cause of genital ulcers is genital herpes , fol- lowed by syphilis, and then chancroid. As of 1997, there were fewer than 1,500 cases of chancroid in the United States per year and it occurred primarily in African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. There are occasional localized outbreaks of chancroid in the United States. In addition, the practice of exchanging sex for drugs has lead to a link between crack cocaine use and chancroid. Even though the incidence of chancroid in the United States decreased in the 1990s, there is an alarming con- nection between chancroid and human immunodeficien- cy virus (HIV) infection. HIV causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and is easily spread from person to person through chancroid ulcers. Uncircum- cised men with chancroid ulcers have a 48% risk of acquiring HIV from sexual contact. Women with chan- croid ulcers are also at a greater risk of being infected with HIV during sexual contact. Genital ulcers seem to act as doorways for HIV to enter and exit. Causes and symptoms Haemophilus ducreyi is spread from person to per- son by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact. Uncircum- cised men are about three times more likely than circum- cised men to become infected following exposure to Haemophilus ducreyi. Having unprotected sex, exchang- ing sex for drugs, and having unprotected sex with a prostitute are other risk factors. Many cases of chancroid in the United States occur in persons who had traveled to countries where the disease is more common. Chancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi pene- trates the skin through an injury, like a scratch or cut. Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The first sign of chancroid is a small, red papule that occurs within three to seven days following exposure to the bacteria, but may take up to one month. Usually within one day, the papule becomes an ulcer. The chancroid ulcer is painful, bleeds easily, drains a grey or yellowish pus, and has sharply defined, ragged edges. They can vary in size from an eighth of an inch to two inches in diameter. Men usually have only one ulcer, but women often have four or more. Sometimes \u201ckissing\u201d ulcers occur when one ulcer spreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin sur- face. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips of the labia majora. Alternatively, women may not have any external sores but may experience painful urination, intercourse, and/or bowel movements and may have a vaginal discharge or rectal bleeding. Signs that the infection has spread to the lymph node appear about one week after the formation of the genital ulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the lymphatic system that filter waste materials from nearly every organ in the body. This lymph node infection is called \u201clymphadenitis\u201d and the swollen, painful lymph node is called a \u201cbubo.\u201d The bubo, which appears as a red, spher- ical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thick pus and forming another ulcer. Diagnosis Chancroid may be diagnosed and treated by urolo- gists (urinary tract doctors for men), gynecologists (for women), and infectious disease specialists. Part of the diagnosis of chancroid involves ruling out genital herpes and syphilis because genital ulcers are also symptoms of these diseases.

          "content": "can be close enough to be confusing. However, the pres- ence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient with a genital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid. For a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus ducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a ster- ile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus sample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special media and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi takes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In addition, the pus may be examined under the microscope to see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample of the pus may also be tested to see if the herpes virus is present. A blood sample will probably be taken from the patient\u2019s arm to test for the presence of antibodies to the bacteria that causes syphilis. Treatment The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics given either once or for several days. Antibiotics taken by mouth for one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin), co-trimoxazole (Bactrim, Septra), or ciprofloxacin (Cipro). Antibiotics given in one dose include ceftriaxone (Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or ofloxacin (Floxin). The ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce the swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to the ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and pre- vent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the foreskin may require circumcision . Pus would be removed from infected lymph nodes by using a needle and syringe. Very large buboes may require surgical drainage. Prognosis Without treatment, chancroid may either go away quickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers for many months. A complete cure is obtained with antibiotic treatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars. Severe scarring of the foreskin may require circumcision. Urethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urine tube to the skin) may occur and requires corrective surgery. KEY TERMS Bubo\u2014A tender, swollen lymph node in the groin that may follow a chancroid ulcer. Groin\u2014The region of the body that lies between the abdomen and the thighs. Prevention The best prevention for chancroid is to use a con- dom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be prevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual con- tact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with a disease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid, it is important that all sexual contacts of the patient are identified and treated.

          "content": "Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with swallowing and chest pain. Because the esophagus does not empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs caus- ing cough, bronchitis , and repeated bouts of pneumo- nia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition become a significant factor in affecting survival. Involvement of the large intestine (colon) causes constipation, distention, and abdominal pain. Diagnosis The best way to diagnose acute infection is to identi- fy the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally it is pos- sible to culture the organism from infected tissue, but this process usually requires too much time to be of value. In the chronic phase, antibody levels can be measured. Efforts to develop new, more accurate tests are ongoing. Treatment In most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is possible. Present medications can reduce the duration and severity of an acute infection, but are only 50% effective, at best, in eliminating the organisms. Cardiac effects are managed with pacemakers and medications. Esophageal complications require either endoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophageal emptying, similar to those used to treat the disorder known as achalasia . Constipation is treated by increas- ing fiber and bulk laxatives, or removal of diseased por- tions of the colon. KEY TERMS Achalasia \u2014An esophageal disease of unknown cause, in which the lower sphincter or muscle is unable to relax normally, and leads to the accu- mulation of material within the esophagus. Endoscopy \u2014Exam using an endoscope (a thin flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature cam- era to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract). When the procedure is performed to exam- ine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pan- creas, the organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirectly through the injection of x ray. Parasite\u2014An organism that lives on or in another and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that organism. Regurgitation \u2014Flow of material back up the esophagus and into the throat or lungs. Prognosis Those patients with gastrointestinal complications often respond to some form of treatment. Cardiac prob- lems are more difficult to treat, particularly since trans- plant would rekindle infection. Prevention Visitors traveling to areas of known infection should avoid staying in mud, adobe, or similar huts. Mosquito nets and insect repellents are useful in helping to avoid contact with the bugs. Blood screening is not always effective in many regions where infection is common. It is necessary to carefully screen people who have emi- grated from Central and South America before they make blood donations.

No one knows exactly how cell therapy works, but pro- ponents claim that the injected cells travel to the similar organ from which they were taken to revitalize and stim- ulate that organ\u2019s function and regenerate its cellular structure. In other words, the cells are not species specif- ic, but only organ specific. Supporters of cellular treat- ment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue con- tain active therapeutic agents distinct from vitamins , minerals, hormones, or enzymes. Swedish researchers have successfully transplanted human fetal stem cells into human recipients, and the procedure is being investigated further as a possible treatment for repairing brain cells in Parkinson\u2019s patients. However, because the cells used in these appli- cations must be harvested from aborted human fetuses, there is an ethical debate over their use. Currently, applications of cell therapy in the United States is still in the research, experimental, and clinical trial stages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of one cellular therapy technique for repairing damaged knee joints. The procedure involves removing healthy chondrocyte cells, the type of cell that forms cartilage, from the patient, culturing them in a laboratory for three to four weeks, and then transplanting them back into the damaged knee joint of the patient. Preparations There are several processes to prepare cells for use. One form involves extracting cells from the patient they are to be used on and then culturing them in a laboratory setting until they multiply to the level needed for trans- plant back into the patient. Another procedure uses fresh- ly removed fetal animal tissue, which has been processed and suspended in a saline solution. The preparation of fresh cells then may be either injected immediately into the patient, or preserved by being freeze-dried or deep- frozen in liquid nitrogen before being injected. Cells may be tested for pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or par- asites, before use. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 687 Cell therapy PAUL NIEHANS (1882\u20131971) Paul Niehans was born and raised in Switzerland. His father, a doctor, was dismayed when he entered the seminary, but Niehans quickly grew dissatisfied with reli- gious life and took up medicine after all. He first studied at Bern, then completed an internship in Zurich. Niehans enlisted in the Swiss Army in 1912. When war erupted in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The war provided him the opportu- nity to treat numerous patients, gaining a firsthand knowl- edge of the body and its workings. Since 1913, Niehans had been intrigued with Alexis Carrel\u2019s experiments concerning the adaptive abilities of cells, though Niehans himself specialized in glandular transplants and by 1925 was one of the leading glandular surgeons in Europe. Niehans referred to 1931 as the birth year of cellular therapy. That year, he treated a patient suffering from tetany whose parathyroid had been erroneously removed by another physician. Too weak for a glandular transplant, the patient was given injections of the parathyroid glands of an ox, and she soon recovered. Niehans made more injections, even experimenting on himself, and reported he could cure illnesses through injections of live cells extracted from healthy animal organs. He believed adding new tissue stimulated rejuvenation and recovery. Niehans treated Pope Pious XII with his injections and was nominated to the Vatican Academy of Science following the pope\u2019s recovery. Niehans remained a controversial figure throughout his life. As of 2000, the Clinique Paul Niehans in Switzer- land, founded by his daughter, continues his work. (AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)",

          "content": "Precautions Because the implants are controversial, very expen- sive, and have uncertain results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited the implants to people: \u2022 who get no significant benefit from hearing aids \u2022 who are at least 2 years old (the age at which specialists can verify severity of deafness) \u2022 with severe to profound hearing loss. Description Hearing loss is caused by a number of different problems that occur either in the hearing nerve or parts of the middle or inner ear. The most common type of deaf- ness is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea, the hearing part of the inner ear. Normally, hair cells stimu- late the hearing nerve, which transmits sound signals to the brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearing nerve remains unstimulated, and the person can\u2019t hear. Hair cells can be destroyed by many things, including infection, trauma, loud noise, aging, or birth defects. All cochlear implants consist of a microphone worn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends it along a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in a small shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processor boosts the sound, filters out background noise, and turns sound into digital signals before sending it to a transmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds the transmitter in place through its attraction to the receiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgical- ly attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiver picks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter, and converts them into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses flow through electrodes contained in a narrow, flexible tube that has been threaded into the cochlea. As many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type of implant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearing nerve. The brain then interprets the signals as specific sounds. Despite the benefits that the implant appears to offer, some hearing specialists and members of the deaf com- munity still believe that the benefits may not outweigh the risks and limitations of the device. Because the device must be surgically implanted, it carries some sur- gical risk. Also, manufacturers can\u2019t promise how well a person will hear with an implant. Moreover, after getting an implant, some people say they feel alienated from the Deaf community, while at the same time not feeling fully a part of the hearing world. The sounds heard through an implant are different from the normal hearing sounds, and have been described as artificial or \u201crobotlike.\u201d This is because the implant\u2019s handful of electrodes cannot hope to match the complexity of a person\u2019s 15,000 hair cells. Surgical procedure During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the ridge on the skull behind the ear) leading into the middle ear. The surgeon then places the receiver-stimulator in the bone, and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. This operation takes between one and one-half to five hours. Preparation Before a person gets an implant, specialists at an implant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, including extensive hearing tests to determine how well the candi- date can hear. Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict who will benefit from an implant. In general, the later in life a per- son becomes deaf, and the shorter the duration of deaf- ness, the better the person is likely to understand speech with an implant. Likewise,someone with a healthy hearing nerve will do better than someone with a damaged nerve. First, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful hear- ing aid. If the aid can\u2019t improve hearing enough, a physi- cian then performs a physical exam and orders a scan of the inner ear (some patients with a scarred cochlea aren\u2019t good candidates). A doctor may also order a psychological exam to better understand the person\u2019s expectations. Patients need to be highly motivated, and have a realistic understanding of what an implant can and cannot do. Aftercare The patient remains in the hospital for a day or two after the surgery.

Performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility under local or general anesthetic, full recovery takes about three weeks but hearing should improve immediately. Tympanoplasty Tympanoplasty is performed to reconstruct the eardrum after partial or total conductive hearing loss, usually caused by chronic middle ear infections, or per- forations that do not heal. This is usually a same day surgery, performed under either local or general anesthe- sia. After making an incision in the ear to view the perfo- ration, the ear drum is elevated away from the ear canal and lifted forward. If the bones of hearing (ossicular chain) are functioning, tissue is taken from the ear and grafted to the eardrum to close the perforation. A thin sheet of silastic and Gelfoam hold the graft in place. The ear is stitched together, and a sterile patch is placed on the outside of the ear canal. Tympanoplasty is successful in over 90% of all cases. The need for ossicular recon- struction (reconstruction of tiny bones of the middle ear) is sometimes known before surgery and and even when identified during surgery, can usually be done while reconstructing the eardrum. If the gap between the anvil bone and the stapes is small, a small piece of bone or car- tilage from the patient can be inserted; if is is large, the incus bone is removed, modelled into a prosthesis, and reinserted between the stapes and the malleus. Recon- struction could also be achieved by inserting a strut made from artificial bone. For tympanoplasty with ossicular reconstruction, the patient usually stays in the hospital overnight. The recovery period is about four weeks. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed to drain ear fluid and prevent ear infections when antibi- otics don\u2019t work or when ear infections are chronic. The process normalizes pressure in the middle ear and decreases fluid accumulation. It is most commonly per- formed on infants and children, in whom ear infections are most frequent, and may be done on one or both ears. The surgeon makes a small hole in the ear drum, then uses suction to remove fluid. A small ear tube of metal or plastic is inserted into the ear drum to allow continual drainage. The tube prevents infections as long as it stays in place, which varies from six months to three years. When the tube falls out, the hole grows over. As many of 25% of children under the age of two who need ear tubes may need them again. Myringotomy and ear tube surgery is performed in a hospital, using a general anesthetic for most children and a local anesthetic for older children or adults. No anesthetic may be used for infants. The proce- dure usually takes about two hours. Most patients can go home the same day; children under three years of age and those with chronic diseases usually stay overnight. Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum Ear surgery for a perforated eardrum is only per- formed in rare cases where it does not heal on its own. In most cases, this is performed in a surgeon\u2019s office using a topical anesthetic. The surgeon scratches the undersur- face of the eardrum, stimulating the skin to heal and the eardrum to close. A thin patch placed on the eardrum\u2019s outer surface allows the skin under the eardrum to heal. Cochlear implants Cochlear implants stimulate nerve ends within the inner ear, enabling deaf children to hear. The device has a microphone that remains outside the ear, a processor that selects and codes speech sounds, and a receiver/stimulator to convert the coded sounds to electric signals that stimulate the hearing nerve and are recognized by the brain as sound. During surgery, an incision is made behind and slightly above the ear. A circular hole is drilled in the bone to receive the device\u2019s internal coil. The mastoid bone leading to the middle ear is opened to receive the electrodes. The internal coil is inserted and secured, followed by the electrodes. The wound is stitched up and when it heals, an external unit comprised of a stimulator with a microphone is worn behind the ear. Performed in a hospital under general anes- thesia, the operation takes about two hours and usually requires a hospital stay overnight. The patient can resume normal activities in two to three weeks.

Some physicians prescribe vitamin C and K in the belief that this promotes healing. Patients will also be advised to stop smoking and to avoid exposure to passive smoke before the procedure and afterward. Some surgeons also recommend antibiotics be taken beforehand to limit the risk of infection. Some surgeons also use a steroid injec- tion before or after the procedure, to reduce swelling. Aftercare After the surgery, a pressure bandage will be applied to the face to reduce the risk of hematoma. The patient may spend a few hours resting in a recovery room to ensure no bleeding has occurred. The patient then returns home. Some surgeons recommend that the patient remain reclining for the next 24 hours, consuming a liquid diet, and avoiding any movements that lead the neck to flex. Ice packs for the first few days can help to reduce swelling and lower the risk of hematoma. Patients continue taking an antibiotic until the first stitches come out about five days after the procedure. The balance are removed seven to 10 days later. Many patients return to work and limited activities within two weeks of the procedure. Risks The major complication seen following face lift surgery is a hematoma. If a hematoma forms, the patient may have to return to have the stitches reopened to find the source of the bleeding. Most hematomas form within 48 hours of surgery. The typical sign is pain or swelling affecting one side of the face but not the other. Another risk of face lift surgery is nerve damage. Sometimes it can affect the patient\u2019s ability to raise an eyebrow, or distort his smile, or leave him with limited feeling in his earlobe. Most of these nerve injuries, how- ever, repair themselves within 2\u20136 months. Normal results Some swelling and bruising is normal following face lift surgery. After these disappear, the patient should see a noticeable improvement in the contour of his face and neck. Some fine wrinkling of the skin may be improved, but deep wrinkles are likely to require another cosmetic procedure to improve their appearance. Abnormal results In addition to the risks outlined above, other compli- cations of face lift surgery include infection, scarring, and hair loss near incision lines.

If the tumor is near the eardrum, the skin of the ear canal and the eardrum are removed along with the bone sur- rounding the ear canal. A skin graft is placed on the bare bone. For basal cell cancers and low grade glandular malignancies, surgical resection of the ear canal is ade- quate. Squamous cell carcinoma, a serious form of can- cer, of the external ear canal requires radical surgery, fol- lowed by radiation therapy . Cholesteatoma, a benign tumor caused by an infection in a perforated eardrum that did not heal properly and can destroy the bones of hear- ing, is removed with microsurgery.

Petrous apicec- tomy is performed to drain the petrous apicitis, the bone between the middle ear and the clivis. Ear surgery for congenital ear defects Congenital atresia, the absence of the external ear canal, and congenital microtia, abnormal growth of the external ear, often occur together, although atresia can occur without microtia. Surgery to reconstruct the ear usually takes place when the child is four or five years old and may require several operations. A facial plastic sur- geon and an ear surgeon work together, repairing the microtia first and then the atresia. During surgery, a bony opening is created over the bones of hearing. The surfaces of the bony ear canal are then relined with a skin graft from the thigh or abdomen. Tissue from behind the eardrum is used to create a new eardrum. In many cases, the middle ear will also need to be reconstructed. Surgery is performed in a hospital under general anesthesia. Other types of ear surgery Surgery may also be appropriate to remove multiple bony overgrowths of the ear canal or in rare cases of compromised auditory tube function, to narrow the tube.

Ultra- sound has advantages over x rays, as several positions are noted during the ultrasound procedure. This is in contrast to only one position observed during the x ray. Treatment The objective of treatment is to replace the head of the femur into the acetabulum and, by applying constant pres- sure, to enlarge and deepen the socket. In the past, stabi- lization was achieved by placing rolled cotton diapers or a pillow between the thighs, thereby keeping the knees in a frog like position. More recently, the Pavlik harness and von Rosen splint are commonly used in infants up to the age of six months. A stiff shell cast may be used, which achieves the same purpose, spreading the legs apart and forcing the head of the femur into the acetabulum. In some cases, in older children between six to 18 months, surgery may be necessary to reposition the joint. Also at this age, the use of closed manipulation may be applied successful- ly, by moving the leg around manually to replace joint. Operations are not only performed to reduce the disloca- tion of the hip, but also to repair a defect in the acetabu- lum. A cast is applied after the operation to hold the head of the femur in the correct position. The use of a home traction program is now more common. However, after the age of eight years, surgical procedures are primarily done for pain reduction measures only. Total hip surgeries may be inevitable later in adulthood. Alternative treatment Nonsurgical treatments include exercise programs, orthosis (a force system, often involving braces), and medications. A physical therapist may develop a program that includes strengthening, range-of-motion exercises, pain control, and functional activities. Chiropractic medicine may be helpful, especially the procedures of closed manipulations, to reduce the dislocated hip joint. Prognosis Unless corrected soon after birth, abnormal stresses cause malformation of the developing femur, with a char- acteristic limp or waddling gait. If cases of congenital hip dysplasia go untreated, the child will have difficulty walking, which could result in life-long pain. In addition, if this condition goes untreated, the abnormal hip posi- tioning will force the acetabulum to locate to another position to accommodate the displaced femur. Prevention Prevention includes proper prenatal care to deter- mine the position of the baby in the womb. This may be KEY TERMS Acetabulum \u2014The large cup-shaped cavity at the junction of pelvis and femur or thigh bone.

          "content": "Eye muscle surgery Definition Eye muscle surgery is surgery to weaken, strength- en, or reposition any of the muscles that move the eyeball (the extraocular muscles). Purpose The purpose of eye muscle surgery is generally to align the pair of eyes so that they gaze in the same direc- tion and move together as a team, either to improve appearance or to aid in the development of binocular vision in a young child. To achieve binocular vision, the goal is to align the eyes so that the location of the image on the retina of one eye corresponds to the location of the image on the retina of the other eye. In addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help people with other eye disorders ( nystagmus and Duane syndrome, for example). Precautions Depth perception (stereopsis) develops around the age of three months old. For successful development of binocular vision and the ability to perceive three-dimen- sionally, the surgery should not be postponed past the age of four. The earlier the surgery the better the outcome, so an early diagnosis is important. Surgery may even be performed before two years old. After surgery, if binocu- lar vision is to develop, corrective lenses and eye exercis- es (vision therapy) will probably be necessary. Description The extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the sclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering of the eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginary equator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye. The other end of each of these muscles attaches to a part of the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These muscles enable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or the other, or any angle in between. Normally both eyes move together, receive the same image on corresponding locations on both retinas, and the brain fuses these images into one three-dimensional image. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder where one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, most often outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose (esotropia). The brain now receives two different images, and either suppresses one or the person sees double (diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakening or strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyes toward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward, the muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened. Rarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people with nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con- dition where one or both eyes move rapidly or oscillate; it can sometimes be helped by moving the eyes to the posi- tion of least oscillation. Duane syndrome is a disorder where there is limited horizontal eye movement; it can sometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle. There are two methods to alter extraocular muscles. Traditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, or reposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon first makes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membrane covering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle to prevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle from the eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, the muscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle is removed so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle is reattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle. In a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition- ing it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might be operated on at the same time. Another way of weakening eye muscles, using botu- linum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced in the early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off, the realignment may be permanent, depending upon whether neurological connections for binocular vision were established during the time the toxin was active. This technique can also be used to adjust a muscle after traditional surgery. The cost of eye muscle surgery is about $2,000\u2013 $4,000, and about 700,000 surgeries are performed annu- ally in the United States. Preparation Patients should make sure their doctors are aware of any medications that they are taking, even over-the- counter medications. Patients should not take aspirin,o r any other blood-thinning medications for ten days prior to surgery, and should not eat or drink after midnight the night before. Aftercare Patients will need someone to drive them home after their surgery. They should continue to avoid aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for an addi- tional three days, but they can take acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol). Patients should discuss this with the surgeon to be clear what medications they can or cannot take. Pain will subside after two to three days, and patients can resume most normal activities within a few days. Again, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1269 Eye muscle surgery",

Digoxin, a drug used to regulate the heart, can cause irregular heart beats, nausea, confusion, loss of appetite, and blurred vision. Narcotics or opiates are drugs like heroin, morphine, and codeine. Clonidine and diphenoxylate (Lomotil) are also in this category. Overdose with opiate drugs causes sedation (sleepiness), low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, and slowed breathing. Pinpoint pupils, where the black centers of the eyes become smaller than normal, are common in opiate overdose. However, if other drugs are taken at the same time as the opiates, they may coun- teract this effect on the pupils. A serious risk is that the patient will stop breathing. Salicylates are found in aspirin and some creams or ointments used for muscle and joint pain (like Ben-Gay), and creams for psoriasis, a skin condition. Initial symp- toms are gastrointestinal irritation, fever, and vomiting, possibly with blood in the vomit. This overdose will cause metabolic acidosisand respiratory alkalosis, con- ditions where the body\u2019s acid/base balance is malfunc- tioning. Symptoms include rapid heart beat and fast breathing. Nervous system symptoms include confusion, hallucinations , tiredness, and ringing in the ears. An increased tendency to bleed is also common. Serious complications include acute renal failure, coma, and heart failure. Acute salicylate poisoning can lead to death. Diagnosis Diagnosis of a drug overdose may be based on the symptoms that develop, however, the drug may do exten- sive damage to the body before significant symptoms develop. If the patient is conscious, he or she may be able to tell what drugs were taken and in what amounts. The patient\u2019s recent medical and social history may also help in a diagnosis. For example, a list of medications that the patient takes, whether or not alcohol was consumed recently, even if the patient has eaten in the last few hours before the overdose, can be valuable in determining what was taken and how fast it will be absorbed into the system. Different drugs have varying effects on the body\u2019s acid/base balance and on certain elements in the blood like potassium and calcium. Blood tests can be used to detect changes in body chemistry that may give clues to what drugs were taken. Blood can also be screened for various drugs in the system. Once the overdose drug is identified, blood tests can be used to monitor how fast the drug is being cleared out of the body. Urine tests can also be used to screen for some drugs and to detect changes in the body\u2019s chemistry. Blood and urine tests may show if there is damage to the liver or kidneys as a result of the overdose. Treatment Immediate care If a drug overdose is discovered or suspected, and the person is unconscious, having convulsions, or is not breathing, call for emergency help immediately. If the person who took the drug is not having symptoms, don\u2019t wait to see if symptoms develop; call a poison control center immediately. Providing as much information as possible to the poison control center can help determine what the next course of action should be. The poison control center, paramedics, and emer- gency room staff will want to know: \u2022 what drug(s) were taken\u2014try to locate the drug\u2019s con- tainer. \u2022 how much of the drug was taken \u2022 when was the drug taken \u2022 was the drug taken with alcohol or any other drugs or chemicals \u2022 what is the age of the patient \u2022 what symptoms are the patient experiencing \u2022 is the patient conscious \u2022 is the patient breathing The poison control center may recommend trying to get the patient to vomit. A liquid called ipecac syrup, which is used to induce vomiting, is available from phar- macies without a prescription. Pediatricians may recom- mend that families keep ipecac syrup on hand in house- holds with children. This medication should be used only on the advice of a medical professional. V omiting should not be induced if the patient is unconscious. Emergency care Emergency medical treatment may include: \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s airway and breathing to making sure that the trachea, the passage to the lungs, is not blocked. If needed, a tube may be inserted through the mouth and into the trachea to help the patient breath. This procedure is called intubation. \u2022 Assessment of the patient\u2019s heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and other physical signs that might indicate the effects of the drug. \u2022 Blood and urine samples may be collected to test for the presence of the suspected overdose drug, and any other drugs or alcohol that might be present.

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries.

An endoscope is a thin flexible tube that uses a lens or mirror to look at various parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic retro- grade cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can accu- rately determine the cause and site of blockage. It also has the advantage of being able to treat the cause of obstruction, by removing stones and dilating (stretching) strictures. ERCP involves the injection of x-ray dye into the bile ducts through an endoscope. Endoscopic ultra- sound is another endoscopic alternative, but is not as available as ERCP and is not therapeutic. Treatment The first aim is to control the bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually used. If the KEY TERMS Antibiotic\u2014A medication that is designed to kill or weaken bacteria.

Computed tomography scan (CT scan)\u2014A special- ized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections of the area in question can be examined in detail. In eval- uating the bile ducts, iodine-based dye is often injected intravenously. The procedure is of greatest value in diagnosing the complications of gallstones (such as abscesses, pancreatitis) rather than docu- menting the presence of a stone. Endoscope \u2014An endoscope as used in the field of gastroenterology is a thin flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is performed to examine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pancreas, the organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirectly through the injection of x-ray dye into the bile duct. Endoscopy\u2014The performance of an exam using an endoscope is referred by the general term endoscopy. Diagnosis through biopsies or other means and therapeutic procedures can be done with these instruments. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)\u2014This is a technique that uses high-pressure waves similar to sound waves that can be \u201cfocused\u201d on a very small area, thereby fracturing small solid objects such as gallstones, kidney stones, etc. The small fragments can pass more easily and harmlessly into the intes- tine or can be dissolved with medications. Primary sclerosing cholangitis \u2014A chronic disease in which it is believed that the immune system fails to recognize the cells that compose the bile ducts as part of the same body, and attempts to destroy them. It is not clear what exactly causes the disease, but it is frequently associated with another inflam- matory disease of the digestive tract, ulcerative coli- tis. The inflammation of the ducts eventually pro- duces formation of scar tissue, causing multiple areas of narrowing (strictures) that block bile flow and lead to bacterial infection. Liver transplant gives the best chance for long-term survival.

It requires no preparation and no radiation occurs. It has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for diag- nosis of stones in the gallbladder, but is less accurate in diagnosing stones in the bile ducts. Gallstones as small as 2 mm can be identified.

          "content": "Chemotherapy Definition Chemotherapy is treatment of cancer with anti- cancer drugs. Purpose The main purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancer cells. It is usually used to treat patients with cancer that has spread from the place in the body where it started (metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells any- where in the body. It even kills cells that have broken off from the main tumor and traveled through the blood or lymph systems to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In some cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cells or to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body. When a cancer has been removed by surgery, chemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from com- ing back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also can ease the symptoms of cancer, helping some patients to have a better quality of life. Precautions There are many different types of chemotherapy drugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treating cancer, determine which drugs are best suited for each patient. This decision is based on the type of cancer, the patient\u2019s age and health, and other drugs the patient is taking. Some patients should not be treated with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age and other conditions may affect the drugs with which a person may be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes are conditions that may limit the choice of treatment drugs. Description More than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently available to treat cancer and many more are being tested for their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most chemothera- py drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul- tiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body, many useful treatments are most effective against rapidly growing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than most other body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of the bone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom- ach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There- fore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy are linked to their effects on other fast growing cells. Types of chemotherapy drugs Chemotherapy drugs are classified based on how they work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs are described below: \u2022 Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking DNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos- phamide is an alkylating drug. \u2022 Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA and keep cells from growing and multiplying. An example of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). \u2022 Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub- stances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere with important cell functions, including production of DNA and cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong to this group of chemotherapy drugs. \u2022 Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally. Vinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtained from the periwinkle plant. \u2022 Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that depend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancers that depend on the hormone estrogen for growth. Combination chemotherapy Chemotherapy is usually given in addition to other cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy. When given with other treatments, it is called adjuvant chemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera- py drug or combination of drugs will work best for each patient. The use of two or more drugs together often works better than a single drug for treating cancer. This is called combination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of different drug combinations help doctors learn which combinations work best for each type of cancer. How chemotherapy is given Chemotherapy is administered in different ways, depending on the drugs to be given and the type of can- cer. Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy drugs con- sidering many factors, among them being the patient\u2019s height and weight. Chemotherapy may be given by one or more of the following methods: \u2022 orally \u2022 by injection \u2022 through a catheter or port \u2022 topically GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 740 Chemotherapy",

          "content": "Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. It destroys the hard-to-detect cancer cells that have spread and are circulating in the body. Chemotherapeutic drugs can be taken either orally (by mouth) or intra- venously, and may be given alone or in conjunction with surgery, radiation or both. When chemotherapy is used before surgery or radia- tion, it is known as primary chemotherapy or \u201cneoadju- vant chemotherapy.\u201d An advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is that since the cancer cells have not been exposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are especially vulnera- ble. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the size of the tumor for surgery or target it for radiation. Howev- er, the toxic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are severe. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant to the side effects of other treatments that follow such as radiation therapy. The more common use of chemothera- py is adjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance the effectiveness of other treatments For example, after surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy any cancerous cells that still remain in the body. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy uses the body\u2019s own immune sys- tem to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment is being intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yet widely available to most cancer patients. The various immunological agents being tested include substances produced by the body (such as the interferons, inter- leukins, and growth factors), monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do not prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treat people who already have the disease. Cancer vaccines work by boosting the body\u2019s immune system and training the immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells. Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is standard treatment for some types of cancers that are hormone-dependent and grow faster in the presence of particular hormones. These include cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor- mone therapy involves blocking the production or action of these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumor slows down and survival may be extended for several months or years. Bone marrow transplantation The bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi- ties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bone marrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supply and is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs or radiation needed to destroy cancer cells also destroys bone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthy cells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone marrow transplant is the removal of marrow from one person and the transplant of the blood-forming cells either to the same person or to someone else. Bone-marrow trans- plantation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to \u201crescue\u201d a patient, by allowing those with cancer to undergo very aggressive therapy. Many different specialists generally work together as a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is a physician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologist provides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any other non-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation. The oncologist often serves as the primary physician and coordinates the patient\u2019s treatment plan. The radiation oncologist specializes in using radia- tion to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performs the operations needed to diagnose or treat cancer. Gyne- cologist-oncologists and pediatric-oncologists, as their titles suggest, are physicians involved with treating women\u2019s and children\u2019s cancers respectively. Many other specialists may also be involved in the care of a cancer patient. For example, radiologists specialize in the use of x rays, ultrasounds, computed tomography scans (CT scans), MRI imaging and other techniques that are used to diagnose cancer. Hematologists specialize in disorders of the blood and are consulted in case of blood cancers and bone marrow cancers. The samples that are removed for biopsy are sent to a laboratory, where a pathologist exam- ines them to determine the type of cancer and extent of the disease. Only some of the specialists who are involved with cancer care have been mentioned above. There are many other specialties, and virtually any type of medical or surgical specialist may become involved with care of the cancer patient should it become necessary. Alternative treatment There are a multitude of alternative treatments avail- able to help the person with cancer. They can be used in conjunction with, or separate from, surgery, chemothera- py, and radiation therapy. Alternative treatment of cancer is a complicated arena and a trained health practitioner should be consulted. Although the effectiveness of complementary thera- pies such as acupuncture in alleviating cancer pain has not been clinically proven, many cancer patients find it safe and beneficial. Bodywork therapies such as massage and reflexology ease muscle tension and may alleviate the side effects such as nausea and vomiting .

Brachytherapy delivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactive materials within close proximity to the cancerous site. Teletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using an external beam machine. Chemotherapy Curative chemotherapy usually requires multiple administrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy or systemic therapy is administered in the blood and circu- lates through the entire body. The choice of chemothera- peutic agents depends on the specific type of cancer. Chemotherapy is more commonly used for metastatic (malignant cancer which has spread to other areas beyond the primary site of cancer growth) disease, since very few cancers are cured by systemic therapy. Biologic therapy Biologic therapies primarily function to alter the patient\u2019s response to cancer. These treatments are mostly investigations and there are numerous research protocols studying the effects of biologic treatments. These proto- cols usually have strict admission criteria that may exclude potential candidates who can benefit from treat- ment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immune cells or immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells. Preparation For all treatment modalities imaging studies, biopsy, and constant blood analysis is essential before, during, and after treatments. Surgical candidates should undergo extensive pre-operative evaluation with imaging studies, blood chemistry analysis, stabilized health status, and readiness of staff for any potential complications and cell biopsy analysis. Patients with other pre-existing chronic disease may require intensive post-operative monitoring. For radiotherapy, the patient undergoes extensive imag- ing studies. Additional planning strategies include beam KEY TERMS Bone marrow suppression \u2014A decrease in cells responsible for providing immunity, carrying oxygen and those responsible for normal blood clotting.

Patients who receive curative chemotherapy should be informed of possible side effects associated with the chemotherapeutic agent. Patients should also be informed of temporary lifestyle changes and medications that may offer some symptomatic relief. Patients undergoing biologic therapies are usually advised of potential side effects, treatment cycles and specific tests for monitoring progress according to the specific research protocol. Aftercare Patients will typically be evaluated by imaging stud- ies, blood analysis, physical examination , and health improvement. These follow-up visits usually occur at spe- cific time intervals during the course of treatment. Surgi- cal patients may require closer observation during the ini- tial post-operative period to avoid potential complica- tions. Reconstructive surgery can be considered to improve appearance and restore function. Certain surgical procedures (such as flaps and microsurgery of blood ves- sels) can restore new tissues to a previous surgery site. Risks Surgical risks Surgical therapy can be both disfiguring and dis- abling. Many normal tissues can be adversely affected by radiotherapy. Side effects that commonly occur shortly after a treatment cycle include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, and bone marrow suppression (a decrease in the cells that provide defense against infections and those which carry oxygen to cells). Radiation risks Radiotherapy can also cause difficulty swallowing, oral gum disease, and dry mouth . Additionally, radia- tion therapy can cause damage to local structures within the irradiated field. Chemotherapy risks Chemotherapy commonly causes bone marrow suppression. Additionally, a cell called platelets\u2014 important for normal blood clotting\u2014may be signifi- cantly lowered, causing patients to bleed. This may be problematic enough to limit the treatment course. Bone marrow suppression can increase susceptibility to infection and also cause infertility . Patients commonly have bouts of nausea and vomiting shortly after a treatment session. Rapidly multiplying normal cells are also affected such as skin cells (causing blistering and ulceration) and hair cells (causing loss of hair, a condi- tion called alopecia).

          "content": "tion. It is essential that the cancer surgeon (oncologic sur- geon) be experienced in the specific procedure. Radiation therapy is commonly administered to approximately 50% of cancer patients during the course of illness. It can be used as the sole method of cure for tumors in the mouth and neighboring structures in the oral cavity, vagina, prostate, cervix, esophagus, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, and certain types of cancer in the spinal cord and brain. Research and clinical trials have demonstrated that combi- nation treatment is more effective than radiotherapy alone. Chemotherapy is curative for only a small percent- age of cancers. It is most effective for choriocarcinoma, cancer of the testis, some types of lymphomas, and can- cer of skeletal muscles. Biological therapies are a new and promising direc- tion for cancer cures. Usually when cancer cells grow they manage to derive a blood supply that allows passage of nutrients promoting continuation of abnormal cancer growth. Research that focuses on destroying these blood vessels is called angiogenesis. Cutting off the blood sup- ply has been shown to destroy tumors, since this stops the flow of essential nutrients required for cancer growth. Use of certain growth factors can also stimulate self- destructive pathways in cancer cells (apoptosis). Gene therapy is directed towards inhibiting specific cellular signals that promote cancer cell multiplication. Precautions Surgical resection requires an experienced surgeon, preoperative assessment, imaging studies, and delicate operative technique. Care should be taken during the pro- cedure to avoid unnecessary tumor manipulation, which can cause cancer cells to infiltrate adjacent structures. If manipulation is excessive, cells can enter nearby areas for future re-growth. Accurate isolation of the tumor can also help to avoid contamination of the surgical area. Early ligation of the blood supply to the tumor is an essential component of a surgical cure. Radiotherapy requires extensive treatment planning and imaging. Care must be taken to localize the cancer field while attempting to spare destruction of normal tis- sue. This requires image monitoring and exact position- ing during radiation treatment sessions. Chemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal cells, and cancer cells can become immune to chemical destruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues are typically anticipated and dosages may have to be specifi- cally altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offer curative responses. Biological therapies may cause patient toxicity resulting in extensive side effects. This can occur since the optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated above patient tolerance. Description Surgery Surgical removal of the tumor must be performed with care and accuracy. The surgeon must avoid over manipula- tion of the surgical field. Too much movement within the area can cause cancer cell displacement into surrounding tissue. If this occurs and no further treatment is indicated, the tumor may grow again. The surgeon should also per- form an assessment concerning tissue removal around the cancer site. Tissue around the site may not by inspection seem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancer cells and surrounding tissue removal is usually part of the operative procedure. Pieces of tumor and the surrounding area are analyzed microscopically during the operation for cell type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) will reveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from areas bordering the cancerous growth. Surgery can also help to decrease the tumor bulk and, along with other treatment measures, may provide a cure for certain cancers. Not only can surgery be curative for some cancers, but it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be assessed intraoperatively since microscopic analysis will guide the surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissue removal. These diagnostic procedures include an aspira- tion biopsy, which inserts a needle to extract (aspirate) fluid contained inside a cancerous growth; a needle biop- sy uses a specialized needle to obtain a core tissue speci- men; an incision biopsy removes a section from a large tumor; and an excision biopsy removes the entire tumor. The surgeon can also take samples of neighboring lymph nodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an impor- tant avenue for distant spread of cancer to other areas. If microscopic analysis determines the presence of cancer cells in lymph nodes then the surgeon may decide to per- form a more aggressive surgical approach. Radiation therapy Similar to surgical intervention, radiotherapy is a localized treatment. It involves the administration of ion- izing radiation to a solid tumor location. This generates reactive oxygen molecules, causing the destruction of DNA in local cells. There are three commonly used radiotherapy beams: gamma rays from a linear accelera- tor machine produce a focused beam; orthovoltage rays are of less energy, thus penetrate less and typically deliv- er higher doses to superficial tissues (efficient for treat- ing skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energy producing beams and can penetrate deeply situated inter- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 639 Cancer therapy, definitive",

Doctors can tell if the chemotherapy is working by the results of medical tests. Physical examination, blood tests, and x rays are all used to check the effects of treat- ment on the cancer. The possible outcomes of chemotherapy are: \u2022 Complete remission or response. The cancer complete- ly disappears.

Purpose Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure on the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote infection. Installing a chest drainage tube can be either an emer- gency or a planned procedure. Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity is also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is some- times called thoracostomy tube drainage. Conditions that may need to be treated by chest drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues of the lungs), tuberculosis , and spontaneous pneu- mothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more than a 25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions include cancer that causes excessive secretions, empyema (pus in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax (blood in the thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage therapy is done to drain blood from the chest cavity after lung or heart surgery. In cases where the lung is collapsed, removing fluids by chest drainage therapy allows the lung to reinflate. Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment to determine whether the problem is either fluid or air in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 743 Chest drainage therapy",

Cancer chemotherapy drugs see Anticancer drugs Cancer therapy, definitive Definition Definitive cancer therapy is a treatment plan designed to potentially cure cancer using one or a combi- nation of interventions including surgery, radiation, chemical agents, or biological therapies. Purpose The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells from the infected person. Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies poten- tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera- tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers. The best chance for a surgical cure is usually with the first opera- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2638 Cancer therapy, definitive",

          "content": "white blood cell count means that the immune system cannot function properly. Low levels of platelets can cause a patient to bleed easily from a cut or other wound. A low red blood cell count can lead to anemia (deficien- cy of red blood cells) and fatigue. When a chemotherapy treatment takes a long time, the patient may prepare for it by wearing comfortable clothes. Bringing a book to read or a tape to listen to may help pass the time and ease the stress of receiving chemotherapy. Some patients bring a friend or family member to provide company and support during treatment. Sometimes, patients taking chemotherapy drugs known to cause nausea are given medications called anti- emetics before chemotherapy is administered. Anti-emet- ic drugs help to lessen feelings of nausea. Two anti-nau- sea medications that may be used are Kytril and Zofran. Other ways to prepare for chemotherapy and help lessen nausea are: \u2022 regularly eat nutritious foods and drink lots of fluids \u2022 eat and drink normally until about two hours before chemotherapy \u2022 eat high carbohydrate, low-fat foods and avoid spicy foods Aftercare Tips for helping to control side effects after chemo- therapy include: \u2022 follow any instructions given by the doctor or nurse \u2022 take all prescribed medications \u2022 eat small amounts of bland foods \u2022 drink lots of fluids \u2022 get plenty of rest Some patients find it helps to breathe fresh air or get mild exercise, such as taking a walk. Risks Chemotherapy drugs are toxic to normal cells as well as cancer cells. A dose that will destroy cancer cells will probably cause damage to some normal cells. Doc- tors adjust doses to do the least amount of harm possible to normal cells. Some patients feel few or no side effects, and others may have more serious side effects. In some cases, a dose adjustment is all that is needed to reduce or stop a side effect. Some chemotherapy drugs have more side effects than others. Some of the most common side effects are: \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 loss of appetite \u2022 hair loss \u2022 anemia and fatigue \u2022 infection \u2022 easy bleeding or bruising \u2022 sores in the mouth and throat \u2022 neuropathy and other damage to the nervous system \u2022 kidney damage Nausea and vomiting are common, but can usually be controlled by taking antinausea drugs , drinking enough fluids, and avoiding spicy foods. Loss of appetite may be due to nausea or the stress of undergoing cancer treatment. Some chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss, but it is almost always temporary. Low blood cell counts caused by the effect of chemotherapy on the bone marrow can lead to anemia, infections, and easy bleeding and bruising. Patients with anemia have too few red blood cells to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body\u2019s tissues. Anemic patients feel tired and weak. If red blood cell levels fall too low, a blood transfusion may be given. Patients receiving chemotherapy are more likely to get infections. This happens because their infection- fighting white blood cells are reduced. It is important to take measures to avoid getting infections. When the white blood cell count drops too low, the doctor may pre- scribe medications called colony stimulating factors that help white blood cells grow. Neupogen and Leukine are two colony stimulants used as treatments to help fight infection. Platelets are blood cells that make the blood clot. When patients do not have enough platelets, they may bleed or bruise easily, even from small injuries. Patients with low blood platelets should take precautions to avoid injuries. Medicines such as aspirin and other pain reliev- ers can affect platelets and slow down the clotting process. Chemotherapy can cause irritation and dryness in the mouth and throat. Painful sores may form that can bleed and become infected. Precautions to avoid this side effect include getting dental care before chemotherapy begins, brushing the teeth and gums regularly with a soft brush, and avoiding mouth washes that contain salt or alcohol.

          "content": "Oral chemotherapy is given by mouth in the form a pill, capsule, or liquid. This is the easiest method and can usually be done at home. Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a vein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand or lower arm. The needle is usually attached to a small tube called a catheter, which delivers the drug to the needle from an IV bag or bottle. Intramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into a muscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injection is absorbed into the blood more slowly than IV chemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IM chemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy given intravenously. Chemotherapy may also be injected sub- cutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin. Injection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer is called intralesional (IL) injection. Chemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or port permanently inserted into a central vein or body cav- ity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is placed in a vein or under the skin in the area where the drug will be given. These methods eliminate the need for repeated injections and may allow patients to spend less time in the hospital while receiving chemotherapy. A common location for a permanent catheter is the external jugular vein in the neck. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is administered into the abdominal cavity through a catheter or port. Chemotherapy given by catheter or port into the spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administra- tion. Catheters and ports may also be placed in the chest cavity, bladder, or pelvis, depending on the location of the cancer to be treated. Topical chemotherapy is given as a cream or oint- ment applied directly to the cancer. This method is more common in treatment of certain types of skin cancer. Treatment location and schedule Patients may take chemotherapy at home, in the doc- tor\u2019s office, or as an inpatient or outpatient at the hospi- tal. Most patients stay in the hospital when first begin- ning chemotherapy, so their doctor can check for any side effects and change the dose if needed. How often and how long chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer, how patients respond to the drugs, patients\u2019 health and ability to tolerate the drugs, and the types of drugs given. Chemotherapy administration may take only a few minutes or may last as long as several hours. Chemotherapy may be given daily, weekly, or monthly. A rest period may follow a course of treatment before the next course begins. In combination chemotherapy, more than one drug may be given at a time, or they may be given alternately, one fol- lowing the other. Preparation A number of medical tests are done before chemotherapy is started. The oncologist will determine how much the cancer has spread from the results of x rays and other imaging tests and from samples of the tumor taken during surgery. Blood tests give the doctor important information about the function of the blood cells and levels of chemi- cals in the blood. A complete blood count (CBC) is commonly done before and regularly during treatment. The CBC shows the numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood. Because chemotherapy affects the bone marrow, where blood cells are made, levels of these cells often drop during chemotherapy. The white blood cells and platelets are most likely to be affected by chemotherapy. A drop in the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 741 Chemotherapy Patient undergoing high dose stem cell chemotherapy.

The resulting blockage restricts blood flow to the heart. When the blood flow is completely cut off, the result is a heart attack. Description Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart disease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8 deaths in the United States was caused by coronary artery disease. About every 29 seconds, one American will have a heart attack; about every minute, one American will die from a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans have active symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attack or chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronary disease, the first indication of which can be sudden death. Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary arteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block- age limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries, which are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood to the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heart is working harder and needs more oxygen. Arteries would expand, for example, when a person is climbing stairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unable to expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardial ischemia ). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or pressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage cuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack (myocardial infarction or heart muscle death). Healthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and slick. The artery walls are flexible and can expand to let more blood through when the heart needs to work harder. The disease process in arteries is thought to begin with an injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. This injury makes them susceptible to atherosclerosis and blood clots (thrombosis). Causes and symptoms Coronary artery disease is usually caused by athero- sclerosis. Cholesterol and other fatty substances accumu- late on the inner wall of the arteries. They attract fibrous tissue, blood components, and calcium and harden into artery-clogging plaques. Atherosclerotic plaques often form blood clots that can also block the coronary arteries (coronary thrombosis). Congenital defects and muscle spasms can also block blood flow. Recent research indi- cates that infection from organisms such as chlamydia bacteria may be responsible for some cases of coronary artery disease. A number of major contributing factors increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease. Some of these can be changed and some cannot. People with more risk factors are more likely to develop coronary artery disease. Major risk factors Major risk factors significantly increase the chance of developing coronary artery disease. Those that cannot be changed are: \u2022 Heredity\u2014People whose parents have coronary artery disease are more likely to develop it. African-Ameri- cans are also at increased risk because they experience a higher rate of severe hypertension than whites do. \u2022 Sex\u2014Men are more likely to have heart attacks than women are and to have them at a younger age. Over age 60, however, women have coronary artery disease at a rate equal to that of men. \u2022 Age\u2014Men who are 45 years of age and older and women who are 55 years of age and older are more likely to have coronary artery disease. Occasionally, coronary disease may strike a person in the 30s. Older people (those over 65) are more likely to die of a heart attack. Older women are twice as likely as older men to die within a few weeks of a heart attack. Major risk factors that can be changed are: \u2022 Smoking\u2014Smoking increases both the chance of developing coronary artery disease and the chance of dying from it. Smokers are two to four times more like- ly than are non-smokers to die of sudden heart attack. They are more than twice as likely as non-smokers to have a heart attack. They are also more likely to die within an hour of a heart attack. Second hand smoke may also increase risk. \u2022 High cholesterol\u2014Dietary sources of cholesterol are meat, eggs, and other animal products. The body also produces it. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect one\u2019s blood cholesterol. Total blood cholesterol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200- 239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130\u2013159 mg/dL, depending on other risk factors. Risk of developing coronary artery disease increases steadily as blood cholesterol levels increase above 160 mg/dL. When a person has other risk factors, the risk multiplies. \u2022 High blood pressure\u2014High blood pressure makes the heart work harder and weakens it over time. It increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and con- gestive heart failure. A blood pressure of 140 over 90 or above is considered high. As the numbers rise, high blood pressure goes from Stage 1 (mild) to Stage 4 (very severe). In combination with obesity, smoking, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 929 Coronary artery disease",

Even modest physi- cal activity, like walking, is beneficial if done regularly. \u2022 Diabetes mellitus\u2014The risk of developing coronary artery disease is seriously increased for diabetics. More than 80% of diabetics die of some type of heart or blood vessel disease. Contributing risk factors Contributing risk factors have been linked to coro- nary artery disease, but their significance is not known yet. Contributing risk factors are: \u2022 Obesity\u2014Excess weight increases the strain on the heart and increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease even if no other risk factors are present. Obesity increases blood pressure and blood cholesterol and can lead to diabetes. \u2022 Stress and anger\u2014Some scientists believe that stress and anger can contribute to the development of coro- nary artery disease and increase the blood\u2019s tendency to form clots (thrombosis). Stress, the mental and physical reaction to life\u2019s irritations and challenges, increases the heart rate and blood pressure and can injure the lin- ing of the arteries. Evidence shows that anger increases the risk of dying from heart disease. The risk of heart attack is more than double after an episode of anger. Chest pain (angina) is the main symptom of coro- nary heart disease but it is not always present. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, chest heaviness, tightness, pain, a burning sensation, squeezing, or pres- sure either behind the breastbone or in the arms, neck, or jaws. Many people have no symptoms of coronary artery disease before having a heart attack; 63% of women and 48% of men who died suddenly of coronary artery dis- ease had no previous symptoms of the disease, according to the American Heart Association. Diagnosis Diagnosis begins with a visit to the physician, who will take a medical history, discuss symptoms, listen to the heart, and perform basic screening tests. These tests will measure weight, blood pressure, blood lipid levels, and fasting blood glucose levels. Other diagnostic tests include resting and exercise electrocardiogram, echocar- diography, radionuclide scans, and coronary angiogra- phy. The treadmill exercise (stress) test is an appropriate screening test for those with high risk factors even when they feel well. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart\u2019s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient\u2019s chest, arms, and legs. They send impulses of the heart\u2019s activity through an oscilloscope (a monitor) to a recorder that traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physician\u2019s office. A definite diagnosis cannot be made from electrocardiog- raphy. About 50% of patients with significant coronary artery disease have normal resting electrocardiograms. Another type of electrocardiogram, known as the exer- cise stress test , measures how the heart and blood ves- sels respond to exertion when the patient is exercising on a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physician\u2019s office or an exercise laboratory. It takes 15\u201330 minutes. It is not perfectly accurate. It sometimes gives a normal reading when the patient has a heart prob- lem or an abnormal reading when the patient does not. If the electrocardiogram reveals a problem or is inconclusive, the next step is exercise echocardiography or nuclear scanning (angiography). Echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, uses sound waves to create an image of the heart\u2019s chambers and valves. A technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer, then presses it against the patient\u2019s chest. The heart\u2019s sound waves are converted into an image that can be displayed on a monitor. It does not reveal the coronary arteries themselves, but can detect abnormalities in heart wall motion caused by coro- nary disease. Performed in a cardiology outpatient diag- nostic laboratory, the test takes 30\u201360 minutes. Radionuclide angiography enables physicians to see the blood flow of the coronary arteries. Nuclear scans are performed by injecting a small amount of radiopharma- ceutical such as thallium into the bloodstream. A device that uses gamma rays to produce an image of the radioac- tive material (gamma camera) records pictures of the heart. Radionuclide scans are not dangerous. The radia- tion exposure is about the same as that in a chest x ray. The tiny amount of radioactive material used disappears from the body in a few days. Radionuclide scans cost about four times as much as exercise stress tests but pro- vide more information. In radionuclide angiography, a scanning camera passes back and forth over the patient who lies on a table. Radionuclide angiography is usually performed in a hos- pital\u2019s nuclear medicine department and takes 30\u201360 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done in conjunc- tion with an exercise stress test. When the stress test is finished, thallium or sestamibi is injected. The patient resumes exercise for one minute to absorb the thallium. For patients who cannot exercise, cardiac blood flow and heart rate may be increased by intravenous dipyridamole (Persantine) or adenosine.

Coronary artery disease is one of the most common causes of congestive cardiomyopathy. In coronary artery disease, the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. When blood flow to an area of the heart is completely blocked, the person has a heart attack. The heart muscle suffers damage when its blood supply is reduced or blocked. Significant recurrent mus- cle damage can occur silently. This damage can lead to congestive cardiomyopathy.

Years of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can weaken the heart muscle, leading to congestive cardiomy- opathy. Other drugs and toxins, such as cocaine, pesti- cides, and other chemicals, may have the same effect. High blood pressure (hypertension) puts extra pres- sure on blood vessels and the heart. This increased pres- sure makes the heart work harder to pump blood, which may thicken and damage the chamber walls. Severe nutritional deficiencies can weaken the heart muscle and affect its pumping ability.

Lori De Milto Coronary disease see Coronary artery disease Coronary heart disease see Coronary artery disease Coronary stenting Definition A coronary stent is an artificial support device used in the coronary artery to keep the vessel open. Purpose The coronary stent is a relatively new tool used to keep coronary arteries expanded, usually following a bal- loon angioplasty. Balloon angioplasty is used in patients with coronary artery disease . In this disease, the blood vessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens, the oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. The primary cause of coronary artery disease is fat deposits blocking the arteries ( atherosclerosis ). In many cases, balloon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closes after the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup- port, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the need for coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain- less steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed inside an artery, the device comes in various sizes to match the size of the artery. Precautions Any foreign object in the body, like a stent, will increase the risk of thrombosis. Anticlotting medication is given to prevent this complication. Description Coronary stenting usually follows balloon angio- plasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter into the femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheter is positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro- nary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, and is then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded into the artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal- loon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronary artery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent against the walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter is removed, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronary artery open. A cardiac angiography will follow to insure that the stent is keeping the artery open. Alternative procedures Balloon angioplasty and coronary stenting are per- formed to relieve the symptoms of coronary artery disease. By the time coronary artery disease progresses and requires balloon angioplasty, there is no alternative to bal- loon angioplasty other than coronary bypass surgery. Coronary bypass surgery carries greater risks. However, since coronary artery disease can be related to high fat diets, smoking, and lack of exercise, changes in lifestyle may reduce the risk of developing the disease. Various medications for cholesterol, high blood pressure, and dia- betes also can help treat or prevent coronary artery disease. Preparation Before the stent is inserted, the patient will probably be instructed to take aspirin for several days. Aspirin can help decrease the possibility of blood clots forming at the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 934 Coronary stenting",

It is usually performed in a hospital\u2019s nuclear medicine department. Each scan takes 30\u201360 minutes. Coronary angiography is the most accurate method for making a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but it is also the most invasive. It is a form of cardiac catheterization that shows the heart\u2019s chambers, great vessels, and coronary arteries using x-ray technology. During coronary angiography the patient is awake but sedated. ECG electrodes are placed on the patient\u2019s chest and an intravenous line is inserted. A local anesthetic is injected into the site where the catheter will be inserted. The cardiologist inserts a catheter into a blood vessel and guides it into the heart. A contrast dye is injected to make the heart visible on x-ray cinematography. Coronary angiography is performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory either in an outpatient or inpatient surgery unit. It takes from 30 minutes to two hours. Treatment Coronary artery disease can be treated many ways. The choice of treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Treatments include lifestyle changes and drug therapy, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplas- ty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Coronary artery disease is a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. Angioplasty or bypass surgery is not a \u201ccure.\u201d People with less severe coronary artery disease may gain adequate control through lifestyle changes and drug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that prevent dis- ease progression\u2014a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, weight loss if needed, exercise, and not smoking\u2014also help pre- vent the disease from developing. These lifestyle changes are discussed in more detail under prevention. Drugs such as nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium- channel blockers relieve chest pain and complications of coronary artery disease, but they cannot clear blocked arteries. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) improve blood flow to the heart. Beta-blockers (acebutelol, propranolol) reduce the amount of oxygen required by the heart during stress. One type of calcium-channel blocker (verapamil, dilti- azem hydrochloride) helps keep the arteries open and reduces blood pressure. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots from forming on plaques, reducing the likelihood of a heart attack. Cholesterol-lowering medications are also indicated in most cases. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery are procedures that enter the body (inva- sive procedures) to improve blood flow in the coronary arteries. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, KEY TERMS Atherosclerosis \u2014A process in which the walls of the coronary arteries thicken due to the accumula- tion of plaque in the blood vessels. Atherosclerosis is the cause of coronary artery disease. Angina\u2014Chest pain that happens when diseased blood vessels restrict the flow of blood to the heart. Angina is often the first symptom of coro- nary artery disease. Beta-blocker \u2014A drug that blocks some of the effects of fight-or-flight hormone adrenaline (epi- nephrine and norepinephrine), slowing the heart rate and lowering the blood pressure. Calcium-channel blocker\u2014A drug that blocks the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of small blood vessels (arterioles) and keeps them from narrowing. Coronary arteries\u2014The main arteries that provide blood to the heart. The coronary arteries surround the heart like a crown, coming out of the aorta, arching down over the top of the heart, and divid- ing into two branches. These are the arteries in which coronary artery disease occurs. HDL cholesterol \u2014High-density lipoprotein cho- lesterol is a component of cholesterol that helps protect against heart disease. HDL is nicknamed \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol LDL Cholesterol\u2014Low-density lipoprotein choles- terol is the primary cholesterol molecule. High levels of LDL increase the risk of coronary heart disease. LDL is nicknamed \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. Plaque\u2014A deposit of fatty and other substances that accumulate in the lining of the artery wall. Triglyceride \u2014A fat that comes from food or is made from other energy sources in the body. Ele- vated triglyceride levels contribute to the develop- ment of atherosclerosis. usually called coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure. A catheter tipped with a balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh into the blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compressing the plaque to enlarge the blood vessel and open the blocked artery. The balloon is deflated, and the catheter is removed.

It is less invasive and less expensive than coronary artery bypass surgery. In coronary artery bypass surgery, a healthy artery or vein from an arm, leg, or chest wall is used to build a detour around the coronary artery blockage. The healthy vessel then supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Bypass surgery is major surgery. It is appropriate for those patients with blockages in two or three major coro- nary arteries, those with severely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and those who have not responded to other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under gen- eral anesthesia. A heart-lung machine is used to support the patient while the healthy vein or artery is attached past the blockage to the coronary artery. About 70% of patients who have bypass surgery experience full relief from angina; about 20% experience partial relief. Only about 3\u20134% of patients per year experience a return of symptoms. Survival rates after bypass surgery decrease over time. At five years after surgery, survival expectancy is 90%; at 10 years about 80%, at 15 years about 55%, and at 20 years about 40%. Three semi-experimental surgical procedures for unblocking coronary arteries are currently being studied. Atherectomy is a procedure in which the cardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque from the blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is inserted into the affected artery to burn or break down the plaque. A metal coil called a stent can be implanted per- manently to keep a blocked artery open. Stenting is becoming more common. Alternative treatment Natural therapies may reduce the risk of certain types of heart disease, but once symptoms appear, con- ventional medical attention is necessary. A healthy diet (including cold-water fish as a source of essential fatty acids) and exercise, important components of conven- tional prevention and treatment strategies, also are emphasized in alternative approaches to coronary artery disease. Herbal medicine has a variety of remedies that may have a beneficial effect on coronary artery disease. For example, ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) may help reduce cholesterol. Garlic ( Allium sativum ), ginger, and hot red or chili peppers are all circulatory enhancers that can help prevent blood clots. Yoga and other bodywork, massage, relaxation therapies, and talking therapies may also help prevent coronary artery disease and stop, or even reverse, the progression of atherosclerosis. Vitamin and mineral therapy to reduce, reverse, or protect against coronary artery disease includes chromium; calcium and magnesium; B-complex vitamins; the anti-oxidant vita- mins C and E; selenium; and zinc. Traditional Chinese medicine may recommend herbal remedies, massage, acupuncture, and dietary modification. Prognosis In many cases, coronary artery disease can be suc- cessfully treated. Advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles have caused a substantial decline in death rates from coronary artery disease since the mid-1980s. New diagnostic techniques enable doctors to identify and treat coronary artery disease in its earliest stages. New tech- nologies and surgical procedures have extended the lives of many patients who would otherwise have died. Research on coronary artery disease continues. Prevention A healthy lifestyle can help prevent coronary artery disease and help keep it from progressing. A heart- healthy lifestyle includes eating right, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, no smoking, moderate drinking, no recreational drugs, controlling hypertension, and managing stress. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are excellent to help prevent recurring coronary problems for people who are at risk and who have had coronary events and procedures. Eat right A healthy diet includes a variety of foods that are low in fat, especially saturated fat, low in cholesterol, and high in fiber. It includes plenty of fruits and vegeta- bles and limited sodium. Some foods are low in fat but high in cholesterol and some are low in cholesterol but high in fat. Saturated fat raises cholesterol and, in exces- sive amounts, increases the amount of the clot-forming proteins in blood. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are good for the heart. Fat should comprise no more than 30% of total daily calories. Cholesterol, a waxy substance containing fats, is found in foods such as meat, eggs, and other animal products. It is also produced in the liver. Soluble fiber can help lower cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per day. Many popular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL cholesterol by an average of 25\u201330% when used with a low-fat, low-cho- lesterol diet. Fruits and vegetables are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are low-calorie and nearly fat free. Vita- min C and beta-carotene, found in many fruits and veg- etables, keep LDL-cholesterol from turning into a form that damages coronary arteries.

The pressure readings that are lower, other than those which are produced as a result of shock, typically are not significant. An ejection fraction, or a comparison of how much blood is ejected from the heart\u2019s left ventricle during its contraction phase with a measurement of blood remain- ing at the end of the left ventricle\u2019s relaxation phase, is also determined by performing a catheterization. The cardiologist will look for a normal ejection fraction read- ing of 60\u201370%. Abnormal results Cardiac catheterization provides valuable still and motion x-ray pictures of the coronary arteries that help in diagnosing coronary artery disease, poor heart function, disease of the heart valves, and septal defects (a defect in the septum, the wall that separates two heart chambers). The most prominent sign of coronary artery disease is the narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries, with narrowing that is greater than 70% considered sig- nificant. A clear indication for intervention (by angio- plasty or surgery) is a finding of significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and/or blockage or severe narrowing in the high, left anterior descending coronary artery. KEY TERMS Aneurysm\u2014An abnormal dilatation of a blood ves- sel, usually an artery. It can be caused by a congeni- tal defect or weakness in the vessel\u2019s wall. Angiography\u2014In cardiac catheterization, a picture of the heart and coronary arteries is seen after injecting a radiopaque substance (often referred to as a dye) throughout the veins and arteries. Angioplasty \u2014An alternative to vascular surgery, a balloon catheter is used to mechanically dilate the affected area of the artery and enlarge the constrict- ed or narrowed segment. Aortic valve \u2014The valve between the heart\u2019s left ventricle and ascending aorta that prevents regurgi- tation of blood back into the left ventricle. Catheter\u2014A tube made of elastic, elastic web, rub- ber, glass, metal, or plastic used to evacuate or inject fluids into the body. In cardiac catheterization, a long, fine catheter is used for passage through a blood vessel into the chambers of the heart. Coronary bypass surgery \u2014A surgical procedure which places a shunt to allow blood to travel from the aorta to a branch of the coronary artery at a point past an obstruction. Left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) \u2014 One of the heart\u2019s coronary artery branches from the left main coronary artery which supplies blood to the left ventricle. Mitral valve\u2014The bicuspid valve which is between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart. Pulmonary valve \u2014The heart valve which is posi- tioned between the right ventricle and the opening into the pulmonary artery. Shunt\u2014A passageway (or an artificially created pas- sageway) that diverts blood flow from one main route to another. Tricuspid valve\u2014The right atrioventricular valve of the heart. A finding of impaired wall motion is an additional indicator of coronary artery disease, aneurysm, an enlarged heart, or a congenital heart problem. Using the findings from an ejection fraction test which measures wall motion, cardiologists look at an ejection fraction reading under 35% as increasing the risk of complica- tions while also decreasing a successful long term or short term outcome with surgery. Detecting the difference in pressure above and below the heart valve can verify heart valve disease. The greater narrowing correlates with the higher pressure dif- ference. To confirm septal defects, a catheterization measures oxygen content on both the left and right sides of the heart. The right heart pumps unoxygenated blood to the lungs, and the left heart pumps blood that contains oxy- gen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Right side ele- vated oxygen levels indicate left-to-right atrial or ven- tricular shunt . A left side that experiences decreased oxygen indicates a right-to-left shunt. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J.

          "content": "Cosmetic dentistry Definition Cosmetic dentistry includes a variety of dental treat- ments aimed at improving the appearance of the teeth. Purpose The purpose of cosmetic dentistry is to improve the appearance of the teeth using bleaching, bonding, veneers, reshaping, orthodontics, or implants. Description Bleaching is done to lighten teeth that are stained or discolored. It entails the use of a bleaching solution applied by a dentist or a gel in a tray that fits over the teeth used at home under a dentist\u2019s supervision. Bond- ing involves applying tooth-colored plastic putty, called composite resin, to the surface of chipped or broken teeth. This resin is also used to fill cavities in front teeth (giving a more natural-looking result) and to fill gaps between teeth. Veneers are thin, porcelain shells that cover the front of the teeth. They can improve the appearance of damaged, discolored, misshapen, or mis- aligned teeth. Reshaping involves the removal of enam- el from a misshapen tooth so that it matches other teeth. Orthodontics uses braces to correct the position of crowded or misaligned teeth. Implants are artificial teeth which are attached directly to the jaw to replace missing teeth. Preparation Bleaching involves having a custom-made bleaching tray made by the dentist. This tray is worn at home for several hours each day or night. Teeth slowly become white over a period of one to six weeks. Bleaching can also be done in a dentist\u2019s office. A heat- or light-activated bleaching solution is applied to six to eight teeth per visit. Bonding involves etching the surface of the tooth so composite resin can adhere. The dentist then contours the resin to the right shape, and smooths and polishes the resin after it is hard and dry. To prepare for the application of a veneer, a thin layer of enamel is removed from the tooth (so that the finished tooth will be flush with surrounding teeth) and an impres- sion of the tooth is taken from which the veneer will be created. Before a veneer is applied, the tooth is etched with an acid solution and an adhesive resin is painted on the tooth. The veneer is then applied, the resin is hardened with a bonding light, and the dentist polishes the veneer. KEY TERMS Bleaching \u2014Technique used to brighten stained teeth. Bonding \u2014Rebuilding, reshaping, and covering tooth defects using tooth-colored materials. Composite resin\u2014Plastic material matching natur- al tooth color used to replace missing parts of a tooth. During cosmetic reshaping, some enamel is removed from the uneven tooth so it more closely match- es other teeth. Orthodontics involves applying braces to the teeth, and wires are threaded through the braces. These wires are adjusted to gradually move the teeth to the desired new positions. Over time, crowded or misaligned teeth are straightened. Implants are more secure and natural looking than dentures or bridgework, but are much more expensive. First an anchor for the implant is attached to the jaw bone. This surgery can take several hours. About six months later, after the bone around the anchor has healed, a post is attached to the anchor, and an artificial tooth is attached to the post. The whole process may take about nine months to complete. Aftercare Periodic touch-up may be needed to keep the teeth white if the teeth have been bleached or bonded. Also, the resin used in bonded teeth can be chipped by ice, popcorn kernels, or hard candy, requiring repair. Veneered teeth may need to be reveneered after five to 12 years. Once orthodontic braces are removed, regular visits to the orthodontist are advised because teeth can shift position. Implanted teeth require regular dental checkups to ensure that the anchor and post are stable. Risks After teeth are bleached, they may darken faster if exposed to staining products such as coffee or tobacco. Some patients experience increased sensitivity to cold while teeth are being bleached, but the sensitivity usually disappears shortly after completion of the treatment. Bonded teeth, like bleached teeth, may also stain more easily than natural teeth. Bonding materials also chip easily. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 939 Cosmetic dentistry",

If the pulp has been seriously damaged, the tooth will require root canal treatment before it receives a crown. A tooth that is vertically fractured or fractured below the gumline will require root canal treat- ment and protective restoration. A tooth which no longer has enough remaining structure to retain a crown may have to be extracted (surgically removed). When a permanent tooth has been knocked out, it may be saved with prompt action. The tooth must be found immediately after it has been lost. It should be picked up by the natural crown (the top part covered by hard enamel). It must not be handled by the root. If the tooth is dirty, it may be gently rinsed under running water. It should never be scrubbed, and it should never be washed with soap, toothpaste, mouthwash, or other chemicals. The tooth should not be dried or wrapped in a tissue or cloth. It must be kept moist at all times. The tooth may be placed in a clean container of milk, cool water with or without a pinch of salt, or in saliva. If possible, the patient and the tooth should be brought to the dentist within 30 minutes of the tooth loss. Rapid action improves the chances of successful re-implantation; however, it is possible to save a tooth after 30 minutes, if the tooth has been kept moist and handled properly. The body usually rejects re-implantation of a prima- ry (baby) tooth. In this case, the empty socket is treated as a soft tissue injury and monitored until the permanent tooth erupts. A broken jaw must be set back into its proper posi- tion and stabilized with wires while it heals. Healing may take six weeks or longer, depending on the patient\u2019s age and the severity of the fracture. Alternative treatment There is no substitute for treatment by a dentist or other medical professional. There are, however, homeo- pathic remedies and herbs that can be used simultaneous- ly with dental care and throughout the healing process. Homeopathic arnica (Arnica montana) should be taken as soon as possible after the injury to help the body deal with the trauma. Repeating a dose several times daily for the duration of healing is also useful. Homeopathic hyper- icum (Hypericum perforatum) can be taken if nerve pain is involved, especially with a tooth extraction or root canal. Homeopathic comfrey (Symphytum officinale)may be helpful in treating pain due to broken jaw bones, but should only be used after the bones have been reset. Cal- endula ( Calendula officinalis ) and plantain ( Plantago major) can be used as a mouth rinse to enhance tissue healing. These herbs should not be used with deep lacera- tions that need to heal from the inside first. Prognosis When dental trauma receives timely attention and proper treatment, the prognosis for healing is good. As with other types of trauma, infection may be a complica- tion, but a course of antibiotics is generally effective. Prevention Most dental trauma is preventable. Car seat belts should always be worn, and young children should be secured in appropriate car seats. Homes should be moni- tored for potential tripping and slipping hazards. Child- proofing measures should be taken, especially for tod- dlers. In addition to placing gates across stairs and padding sharp table edges, electrical cords should be tucked away. Young children may receive severe oral burns from gnawing on live power cords. Everyone who participates in contact sports should wear a mouthguard to avoid dental trauma. Athletes in football, ice hockey, wrestling, and boxing commonly wear mouthguards. The mandatory use of mouthguards in football prevents about 200,000 oral injuries annually. Mouthguards should also be worn along with helmets in noncontact sports such as skateboarding, in-line skating, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1030 Dental trauma",

Joseph Knight, PA Cosmetic surgery see Plastic, cosmetic, and reconstructive surgery Costochondritis Definition Costochondritis is an inflammation and associated tenderness of the cartilage (i.e., the costochondral joints) that attaches the front of the ribs to the breastbone. Description Costochondritis causes pain in the lower rib area or upper breastbone. Some patients fear they are having a heart attack. The most severe pain is usually between the breast and the upper abdomen. The pain may be greater when in sitting or reclining positions. Stress may aggra- vate this condition. Generally the third or fourth ribs are affected. However, any of the seven costochondral junc- tions may be affected, and more often than not more than one site is involved. The inflammation can involve carti- lage areas on both sides of the sternum, but usually is on one side only. Costochondritis should be distinguished from Tietze Syndrome, which is an inflammation involv- ing the same area of the chest, but also includes swelling. Causes and symptoms The causes of costochondritis are not well-under- stood and may be difficult to establish. The most likely causes include injury, repetitive minor trauma, and unusual excessive physical activity. The primary symptom of costochondritis is severe chest wall pain, which may vary in intensity. The pain becomes worse with trunk movement, deep breathing, and/or exertion, and better with decreased movement, quiet breathing, or changing of position. It is usually localized but may radiate extensively from the chest area. The pain has been described as sharp, nagging, aching, or pressure-like. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on pain upon palpation (gentle pressing) of the affected joints. Swelling is not associated with costochondritis. Diagnosis is also dependent on the exclusion of other causes, including heart attack or bac- terial or fungal infections found in IV drug users or post- operative thoracic surgery patients. Treatment The goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation and to control pain. To accomplish these goals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are used, with ibupro- fen usually selected as the drug of choice. Other NSAIDS options are flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, ketoprofen, and naproxen. Additional treatment recommendations include the use of local heat,biofeedback, and gentle stretching of the pectoralis muscles two to three times a day. For more difficult cases, where the patient continues to exhibit pain and discomfort, cortisone injections are used as therapy. Alternative treatment Supplements that are used to reduce inflammation have been used to treat costochondritis. Examples of such supplements include ginger root, evening primrose oil, bromelain, vitamin E, omega-3 oils, and white wil- low bark. Glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate, which may aid in the healing of cartilage, has also been used. Other alternative therapies include acupuncture and massages. Prognosis The prognosis for recovery from costochondritis is good. For most patients, the condition lessens in six GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 940 Costochondritis",

          "content": "Fabry\u2019s disease see Lipidoses Face lift Definition Face lift surgery is a cosmetic procedure that involves redirecting some of the skin and muscle tissue of the face and neck to counter signs of aging produced by gravity. Purpose The purpose of face lift surgery, also known as facialplasty, rhytidoplasty, or cervicofacial rhytidectomy, is to improve the appearance of the face by repositioning the skin and tightening some of the underlying muscle and tissue. The procedure is designed to counter sagging and looseness in skin and muscle tissue caused by gravi- ty as the patient ages. Face lift surgery will not erase all facial wrinkles, as the term rhytidectomy (which literally means \u201csurgical removal of wrinkles\u201d) might imply. Wrinkles around the mouth and eyes, for example, may benefit little from face lift surgery. Other procedures, such as blepharoplasty, chemical peel, or dermabrasion, also may be necessary. Precautions Patients with other medical conditions should consult with their primary physician before undergoing face lift surgery. Lung problems, heart disease, and certain other conditions can lead to a higher risk of complications. Patients who take medications that can alter the way their blood clots (including female hormones, aspirin, and some non-aspirin pain relievers) should stop these med- ications prior to surgery to lower the risk that a hematoma will form. A hematoma, a pocket of blood below the skin, is the most frequent complication of face lift surgery. Description Face lift surgery can be performed on an outpatient basis with local anesthetics. Patients typically also receive \u201ctwilight anesthesia,\u201d an intravenous sedative that helps to lower their awareness of the procedure being performed. There are a number of variations of face lift surgery. Which one is used will depend on the patient\u2019s facial structure, how much correction is needed, and the prefer- ences of the surgeon performing the procedure. In a typi- cal face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making an inci- sion within the hairline just above the ear. The incision continues down along the front edge of the ear, around the earlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending back into the hairline. The location of this incision is designed to hide any sign of the procedure later. The same proce- dure is repeated on the other side of the face. Using vari- ous instruments, the surgeon will then work to separate the skin of the face from its underlying tissue, moving down to the cheek and into the neck area and below the chin. Fat deposits over the cheeks and in the neck may be removed surgically or with liposuction at this time. The surgeon will then work to free up and tighten certain bands of mus- cle and tissue that extend up from the shoulder, below the chin, and up and behind the neck. If these muscles and tis- sue are not tightened, the looseness and sagging appear- ance of the skin will return. The surgeon then trims excess skin from the edges of the original incision, pulls the skin back, and staples or sutures it into place. Preparation Prior to the procedure, patients meet with their sur- geon to discuss the surgery, clarify the results that can be achieved, and discuss the potential problems that can occur. Having realistic expectations is important in any cosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, that although face lift surgery can improve the contour of the face and neck, other procedures will be necessary to reduce the appearance of many wrinkles.

Donald Gardner Barstow Depersonalization disorder see Dissociative disorders Depo-Provera/Norplant Definition Norplant is a long-acting hormone that is inserted under the skin and prevents conception for up to five years. Depo-Provera is also a hormone, but is administered by intramuscular injection and provides protection against pregnancy for three months. Lunelle is another injectable contraceptive that is administered monthly (every 28 to 30 days); it was approved by the Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) in October 2000. The hormone in Norplant and Depo-Provera is progestin, a synthetic hormone similar to one found naturally in a woman\u2019s body; Lunelle contains the hormones progestin and estrogen. Purpose The purpose of these hormones is to prevent preg- nancy; they are about 99% effective in achieving this goal. No hormonal contraceptive methods provide protec- tion from AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. Depo-Provera and Lunelle are given as an injection and work in several ways to prevent conception. First, the egg (ovum) is prevented from maturing and being released. The mucus in the cervix (opening into the uterus or womb) becomes thicker, making it difficult for the sperm to enter. Depo-Provera and Lunelle also cause the lining of the uterus to become thinner, making implantation of a fertilized egg unlikely. An injection of Depo-Provera or Lunelle must be given within the first five days of a normal period. Depo- Provera provides protection against pregnancy for three months, while Lunelle provides similar protection for one month. Ovulation (release of a mature egg) typically occurs within 60 days of the last injection of Lunelle, about twice as fast after use of Depo-Provera. Also, because Lunelle is a combined hormone contraceptive as opposed to progestin-only Depo-Provera and Norplant, it is less likely to cause irregular or absent menstruation. Norplant capsules contain a synthetic hormone that is slowly released over a period of up to five years. It functions like Depo-Provera in that it prevents the ovaries from producing ova (eggs) and also results in thicker mucus in the cervix, which prevents the sperm from passing through the cervix. Norplant can be insert- ed at any time. Preparation The woman being considered for Depo-Provera or Lunelle will have a pelvic and breast examination, a Pap test (a microscopic examination of cell samples taken from the cervix), blood pressure check, weight check, and a review of her medical history. Women who have diabetes mellitus , major depression, blood clotting problems, liver disease, or weight problems should use these methods only under strict medical supervision. Depo-Provera or Lunelle should not be used if the woman is pregnant, has unexplained vaginal bleeding, GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1031 Depo-Provera/Norplant A physician inserts a contraceptive implant under the skin of a woman\u2019s arm.

Some physicians prescribe vitamin C and K in the belief that this promotes healing. Patients will also be advised to stop smoking and to avoid exposure to passive smoke before the procedure and afterward. Some surgeons also recommend antibiotics be taken beforehand to limit the risk of infection. Some surgeons also use a steroid injec- tion before or after the procedure, to reduce swelling. Aftercare After the surgery, a pressure bandage will be applied to the face to reduce the risk of hematoma. The patient may spend a few hours resting in a recovery room to ensure no bleeding has occurred. The patient then returns home. Some surgeons recommend that the patient remain reclining for the next 24 hours, consuming a liquid diet, and avoiding any movements that lead the neck to flex. Ice packs for the first few days can help to reduce swelling and lower the risk of hematoma. Patients continue taking an antibiotic until the first stitches come out about five days after the procedure. The balance are removed seven to 10 days later. Many patients return to work and limited activities within two weeks of the procedure. Risks The major complication seen following face lift surgery is a hematoma. If a hematoma forms, the patient may have to return to have the stitches reopened to find the source of the bleeding. Most hematomas form within 48 hours of surgery. The typical sign is pain or swelling affecting one side of the face but not the other. Another risk of face lift surgery is nerve damage. Sometimes it can affect the patient\u2019s ability to raise an eyebrow, or distort his smile, or leave him with limited feeling in his earlobe. Most of these nerve injuries, how- ever, repair themselves within 2\u20136 months. Normal results Some swelling and bruising is normal following face lift surgery. After these disappear, the patient should see a noticeable improvement in the contour of his face and neck. Some fine wrinkling of the skin may be improved, but deep wrinkles are likely to require another cosmetic procedure to improve their appearance. Abnormal results In addition to the risks outlined above, other compli- cations of face lift surgery include infection, scarring, and hair loss near incision lines.

Performed with an optic instrument known as a cystoscope (urethroscope), this instrument uses a lighted tip for guidance to aid in diagnosing urinary tract disease and prostate disease. Performed by a urologist, this surgi- cal test also enables biopsies to be taken or small stones to be removed by way of a hollow channel in the cysto- scope. Purpose Categorized as an endoscopic procedure, cystoscopy is used by urologists to examine the entire bladder lining and take biopsies of any areas that look questionable. This test is not used on a routine basis, but may benefit the urol- ogist who is needing further information about a patient who displays the following symptoms or diagnosis: \u2022 blood in the urine (also known as hematuria) \u2022 incontinence or the inabililty to control urination \u2022 a urinary tract infection \u2022 a urinary tract which display signs of congenital abnor- malities \u2022 tumors located in the bladder \u2022 the presence of bladder or kidney stones \u2022 a stiffness or strained feeling of the urethra or ureters \u2022 symptoms of an enlarged prostate Blood and urine studies, in addition to x rays of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, may all occur before a cys- toscopy. At the time of surgery, a retrograde pyelogram may also be performed. Additional blood studies may be needed immediately following surgery. Precautions While the cystoscopy procedure is commonly relied upon to gather additional diagnostic information, it is an invasive surgical technique that may involve risks for certain patients. Those who are extremely overweight (obese), smoke, are recovering from a recent illness, or are treating a chronic condition may face additional risks from surgery. Surgical risk also increases in patients who are cur- rently using certain drugs including antihypertensives; muscle relaxants; tranquilizers; sleep inducers; insulin; sedatives; beta blockers ; or cortisone. Those who use mind-altering drugs also put themselves at increased risk of complications during surgery. The following mind-altering drugs should be avoided: narcotics; psychedelics; hallu- cinogens; marijuana; sedatives; hypnotics; or cocaine. Description Depending on the type of information needed from a cystoscopy, the procedure typically takes 10\u201340 minutes to complete. The patient will be asked to urinate before surgery which allows an accurate measurement of the remaining urine in the bladder. A well lubricated cysto- scope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder where a urine sample is taken. Fluid is then pushed in to inflate the bladder and allow the urologist to examine the entire bladder wall. During an examination, the urologist may take the fol- lowing steps: remove either bladder or kidney stones; gather tissue samples; and treat any suspicious lesions. In order to perform x-ray studies (retrograde pyelogram), a harmless dye is injected into the ureters by way of a catheter that is passed through the previously placed cystoscope. After completion of all needed tests, the cystoscope is removed.

          "content": "Diagnosis A major consideration with congenital abnormali- ties is that they tend to be multiple. Further, each one is unique in its extent and severity. Exstrophy can involve the rectum and large bowel and coexist with hernias. The obvious bladder exstrophy seen at birth will prompt immediate action and a search for other anomalies. Diverticula are not visible and will be detected only if they cause trouble. They are usually found in an examination for the cause of recurring urinary infec- tions. X rays of the urinary system or a cystoscopy (examination with a telescope-like instrument) will identify them. Often, the two procedures are done together: a urologist will perform the cystoscopy, then a radiologist will instill a contrast agent into the bladder and take x rays. Treatment Surgery is necessary and can usually produce suc- cessful results. If possible, the surgery must be done within 48 hours of birth. Prior to surgery, the exposed organs must be protected and all related defects identi- fied and managed. Delay in the surgery leads to the frequent need to divert the urine into the bowel because the partially repaired bladder cannot control the flow. After surgery, the likelihood of infection requires monitoring. Alternative treatment After surgery ongoing precautions to reduce fre- quency of infection may need to be used. Cranberry juice has the ability to keep bacteria from adhering to the membranes and can help prevent infection when- ever there is increased risk. There are botanical and homeopathic treatments available, however consulta- tion by a trained practitioner is recommended before treatment. Prognosis With immediate surgery, three-quarters of patients can be successfully repaired. They will have control of their urine and no long-term consequences. The rate of infection is greater for those with congenital bladder anomalies, since any abnormality in the urinary system predisposes it to invasion by bacteria. Prevention Birth defects often have no precisely identified cause, therefore prevention is limited to general mea- sures such as early and continuous prenatal care, appro- priate nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle.

Purpose Cystectomy is performed to treat cancer of the blad- der. Radiation and chemotherapy are also used to treat bladder cancer. Surgery is used to remove cancer when it is in the muscle of the bladder. Precautions Cystectomy is an aggressive treatment that may not be appropriate for patients with superficial tumors that respond to more conservative treatment. Description Cystectomy is a major surgical operation. The patient is placed under general anesthesia. An incision is made across the lower abdomen. The ureters are located, tied and cut. The ureters connect the kidneys to the blad- der. Cutting them frees the bladder for removal. The bladder and associated organs are removed. In men, the prostate is removed with the bladder. In women, the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and part of the vagina are removed with the bladder. The bladder collects urine from the kidneys for excretion at a later time. Since the bladder is removed, a new method must be created to remove the urine. A small piece of the small intestine is removed, cleaned, and tied at one end to form a tube. The other end is used to form a stoma, an opening through the abdominal wall to the outside. The ureters are then con- nected to the tube. Urine produced by the kidneys now flows down the ureters, into the tube, and through the stoma. The patient wears a bag to collect the urine. Preparation The medical team will discuss the procedure and tell the patient where the stoma will appear and what it will look like. The patient receives instruction on caring for a stoma and bag. Counseling may be initiated. A period of fasting and an enema may be required. KEY TERMS Ureters \u2014Tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. Urine produced by the kidneys passes through the ureters to the bladder. Aftercare After the operation, the patient is given fluid-based nutrition until the intestines being to function normally again. Antibiotics are given to prevent infection of the incision sites. The nature of the organs removed mean that there will be major lifestyle changes for the person undergoing the operation. Men will become impotent because nerves controlling penile erection are cut during removal of the bladder. In women, infertility is a conse- quence because the ovaries and uterus are removed. However, most women who undergo cystectomy are postmenopausal and past their childbearing years. Both men and women are fitted with an external bag that connects to the stoma and collects the urine. The bag is generally worn around the waist under the clothing. It takes a period of adjustment to get used to wearing the bag. Because there is no bladder, urine is excreted as it is produced, essentially continuously. The stoma must be treated properly to ensure that it does not become infect- ed or blocked. Patients must be trained to care for their stoma. Often there is a period of psychological adjust- ment to the major change in life style created by the stoma and bag. Patients should be prepared for this by discussion with their physician. Risks As with any major surgery, there is a risk of infec- tion; in this case, infection of the intestine is especially dangerous as it can lead to peritonitis (inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen). Normal results The bladder is successfully removed and a stoma created. Intestinal function returns to normal and the patient learns proper care of the stoma and bag. He or she adjusts to lifestyle changes and returns to a normal rou- tine of work and recreation, some sports excluded. Abnormal results The patient develops an infection at the incision site. The patient does not make a successful psychological adjustment to the long term consequences of impotence GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 983 Cystectomy",

          "content": "how far the cancer has spread). For example, additional pelvic exams may be performed under anesthesia. There are several procedures for determining if cer- vical cancer has invaded the urinary tract. With cys- toscopy, a lighted tube with a lens is inserted through the urethra (the urine tube from the bladder to the exterior) and into the bladder to examine these organs for cancer- ous cells. Tissue samples may be removed for micro- scopic examination by a pathologist. Intravenous urog- raphy (intravenous pyelogram or IVP) is an x ray of the urinary system, following the injection of special dye. The kidneys remove the dye from the bloodstream and the dye passes into the ureters (the tubes from the kid- neys to the bladder) and bladder. IVP can detect a blocked ureter, caused by the spread of cancer to the pelvic lymph nodes (small glands that are part of the immune system). A procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is similar to cystoscopy. It is used to determine whether the cancer has spread to the rectum or lower large intestine. Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans, ultra- sound, or other imaging techniques may be used to deter- mine the spread of cancer to various parts of the body. With a CT scan, an x-ray beam rotates around the body, taking images from various angles. It is used to deter- mine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a magnetic field to image the body, sometimes is used for evaluating the spread of cervical cancer. Chest x rays may be used to detect cervical cancer that has spread to the lungs. Treatment Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, the physi- cian takes a medical history and performs a complete physical examination . This includes an evaluation of symptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer. The lymph nodes are examined for evidence that the cancer has spread from the cervix. The choice of treatment depends on the clinical stage of the disease. The FIGO system of staging The International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) system usually is used to stage cer- vical cancer: \u2022 Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ; non-invasive cancer that is confined to the layer of cells lining the cervix \u2022 Stage I: Cancer that has spread into the connective tis- sue of the cervix but is confined to the uterus \u2022 Stage IA: Very small cancerous area that is visible only with a microscope \u2022 Stage IA1: Invasion area is less than 3 mm (0.13 in) deep and 7 mm (0.33 in) wide \u2022 Stage IA2: Invasion area is 3\u20135 mm (0.13\u20130.2 in) deep and less than 7 mm (0.33 in) wide \u2022 Stage IB: Cancer can be seen without a microscope or is deeper than 5 mm (0.2 in) or wider than 7 mm (0.33 in) \u2022 Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in) \u2022 Stage IB2: Stage IB cancer is larger than 4 cm (1.6 in) \u2022 Stage II: Cancer has spread from the cervix but is con- fined to the pelvic region \u2022 Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the upper region of the vagina, but not to the lower one-third of the vagina \u2022 Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to the parametrial tissue adjacent to the cervix \u2022 Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lower one-third of the vagina or to the wall of the pelvis and may be blocking the ureters \u2022 Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower vagina but not to the pelvic wall \u2022 Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/or is blocking the flow of urine through the ureters to the bladder \u2022 Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body \u2022 Stage IV A: Cancer has spread to the bladder or rectum \u2022 Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to distant organs such as the lungs \u2022 Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned to the cervix or some other part of the body In addition to the stage of the cancer, factors such as a woman\u2019s age, general health, and preferences may influence the choice of treatment. The exact location of the cancer within the cervix and the type of cervical can- cer also are important considerations. Treatment of precancer and carcinoma in situ Most low-grade SILs that are detected with Pap tests revert to normal without treatment. Most high-grade SILs require treatment. Treatments to remove precancer- ous cells include: \u2022 cold knife cone biopsy \u2022 LEEP \u2022 cryosurgery (freezing the cells with a metal probe) \u2022 cauterization or diathermy (burning off the cells) \u2022 laser surgery (burning off the cells with a laser beam) These methods also may be used to treat cancer that is confined to the surface of the cervix (stage 0) and other GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 713 Cervical cancer",

While this test is typically performed on an outpatient basis, a patient may require up to three days of recovery in the hospital. Aftercare Patients who have undergone a cystoscopy will be instructed to follow these steps to ensure a quick recovery: \u2022 due to soreness or discomfort that may occur in the ure- thra, especially while urinating, several warm baths a day are recommended to relieve any pain \u2022 allow four days for recovery \u2022 blood may appear in the urine\u2014this is common, and soon clears up in one to two days following the procedure \u2022 avoid strenuous exercise for a minimum of two weeks following surgery \u2022 sexual relations may continue when the urologist deter- mines that healing is complete \u2022 wait at least two days after surgery before driving Patients may also be prescribed pain relievers and antibiotics following surgery. Minor pain may also be treated with over-the-counter, non-prescription drugs such as acetaminophen. Risks As with any surgical procedure, there are some risks involved with a cystoscopy. Complications may include: profuse bleeding; a damaged urethra; a perforated blad- der; a urinary tract infection; or an injured penis. Patients should also contact their physician if they experience any of the following symptoms following surgery: pain, redness, swelling, drainage, or bleeding from the surgical site; signs of infection that may include headache, muscle aches, dizziness or an overall ill feel- ing and fever; nausea or vomiting; strenuous or painful urination; or symptoms that may result as side-effects from the medication. Normal results A successful cystoscopy includes a thorough exami- nation of the bladder and collection of urine samples for cultures. If no abnormalities are seen, the results are indi- cated as normal. Abnormal results Cystoscopy allows the urologist to detect inflamma- tion of the bladder lining, prostatic enlargement, or tumors. If these are seen, further evaluation or biopsies may be needed in addition to the removal of some tumors.

Infection of the bladder or urethra may cause incontinence, as can obstruction of the urethra from scar tissue, prostate enlargement, or other benign or cancer- ous growths. Loss of sensation due to nerve damage can lead to chronic overfilling. Precautions The mild irritation of the urinary tract necessary for insertion of the catheter may occasionally cause flushing, sweating, and nausea. Description The patient begins by emptying the bladder as much as possible. A thin plastic catheter is then slowly inserted into the urethra until it reaches the bladder. Measure- ments are taken of the residual urine volume and bladder pressure. Pressure measurements may require a rectal probe to account for the contribution of the abdominal muscles to the pressure recording. The bladder is then gradually filled with either warm water, room temperature water, saline solution, carbon diox- ide gas, or a contrast solution for x-ray analysis, depending on the type of study being done. The patient is asked to describe sensations during filling, including temperature sensations and when the first feeling of bladder fullness occurs. Once the bladder is completely full, the patient is asked to begin voiding, and measurements are again made of pressure and volume, as well as flow rate and pressure. Preparation There is no special preparation needed for this test. The patient may be asked to stop taking certain medica- tions in advance of the test, including sedatives, choliner- gics, and anticholinergics. Aftercare Cystometry can be somewhat uncomfortable. The patient may wish to reserve an hour or so afterward to recover. Urinary frequency or urgency, and some redden- ing of the urine, may last for a day. Increasing fluid intake helps to flush out the bladder, but caffeinated, carbonated, or alcoholic beverages are discouraged, because they may irritate the bladder lining. Signs of infection, such as fever, chills, low back pain , or persistent blood in the urine, should be reported to the examining physician. Risks There is a slight risk of infection due to tearing of the urethral lining. KEY TERMS Detrusor\u2014Muscle of the bladder wall. Sphincter \u2014Ring of muscle between the bladder and the urethra that functions to close off the ure- thra. Urethra\u2014Tube that empties urine from the blad- der to the exterior of the body. Normal results The normal bladder should not begin contractions during filling and should initially expand without resis- tance. A feeling of fullness occurs with a volume of 100\u2013200 ml. The adult bladder capacity is 300\u2013500 ml. The sphincter should relax and open when the patient wills it, accompanied by detrusor contractions. During voiding, detrusor contraction should be smooth and lead to a steady urine stream. Abnormal results Inability of the bladder to relax during filling, or low bladder volume, may indicate interstitial cystitis, prostate enlargement, or bladder cancer. Contraction of the blad- der during filling may be due to irritation from infection or cysts, obstruction of the bladder outlet, or neurological disease such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury. Diminished sensation may occur with nerve lesions, peripheral neuropathy, or chronic overfilling. Resources BOOKS Lamm D. L., A. S. Paola, and F. A. Paola.

          "content": "Description The urogenital system, for some reason, is more likely than any other to have birth defects, and they can occur in endless variety. Ureters can be duplicated com- pletely or partially, they can be in the wrong place, they can be deformed, and they can end in the wrong place. The trouble these abnormalities bring is directly related to their effect on the flow of urine. As long as urine flows normally through them, and only in one direction, no harm is done. \u2022 Duplication of ureters is quite common, either in part or completely. Kidneys are sometimes duplicated as well. Someone may have four kidneys and four ureters or two kidneys, half of each drained by a separate ureter, or a sin- gle kidney with two, three, or four ureters attached. As long as urine can flow easily in the correct direction, such malformations may never be detected. If, however, one of the ureters has a dead end, a stricture or stenosis (narrow- ing), or a leaky ureterovesical valve (valve between the ureter and bladder), infection is the likely result. \u2022 Stricture or stenosis of a ureter prevents urine from flowing freely. Whenever flow is obstructed in the body\u2014urine, bile, mucus, or any other liquid\u2014infec- tion follows. Ureters can be obstructed anywhere along their course, though the ureterovesical valve is the most common place. \u2022 A ureter may have an ectopic (out of place) orifice (opening)\u2014it may enter the bladder, or even another structure, where it does not belong and therefore with- out an adequate valve to control reflux. \u2022 The primary ureter, or a duplicate, may not even reach the bladder, but rather terminate in a dead end. Urine will stagnate there and eventually cause infection. \u2022 A ureter can be perfectly normal but in the wrong place, such as behind the vena cava (the large vein in the mid- dle of the abdomen). A so-called retrocaval ureter may be pinched by the vena cava so that flow is hindered. Other aberrant locations may also lead to compression and impaired flow. Besides infection, urine that backs up will cause the ureter and the kidney to dilate. Eventually, the kidney will stop functioning because of the back pressure. This condition is called hydronephrosis\u2014a kidney swollen with urine. Causes and symptoms The causes of birth defects are multiple and often unknown. Furthermore, the precise cause of specific birth defects has only rarely been identified. Such is the case with congenital ureteral anomalies. KEY TERMS Congenital\u2014Present at birth. Contrast agent \u2014A chemical or other substance placed in the body to show structures that would not otherwise be visible on x ray or other imaging studies. Cystoscopy \u2014Looking into the urinary bladder with a thin telescope-like instrument. Ectopic\u2014Out of place. Septicemia \u2014A serious whole body infection spreading through the blood stream. Uretreovesical valve \u2014A sphincter (an opening controlled by a circular muscle), located where the ureter enters the bladder, that keeps urine from flowing backward toward the kidney. Urogenital\u2014Both the urinary system and the sex- ual organs, which form together in the developing embryo. Practically the only symptom generated by ureteral abnormalities is urinary tract infection. A lower tract infection\u2014in the bladder\u2014is called cystitis. In children, it may cause fever and systemic symptoms, but in adults it causes only cloudy, burning, and frequent urine. Upper tract infections, on the other hand, can be serious for both adults and children, causing high fevers, back pain, severe generalized discomfort, and even leading to kid- ney failure or septicemia (infection spreading throughout the body by way of the blood stream). In rare cases, urine from an ectopic ureter will bypass the bladder and dribble out of the bottom somewhere, through a natural orifice like the vagina or a completely separate unnatural opening. Diagnosis Serious or recurrent urinary infections will prompt a search for underlying abnormalities. Cystoscopy (look- ing into the bladder with a thin telescope-like instrument) and x rays with a contrast agent to illuminate the urinary system will usually identify the defect. Computed tomography scans (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may provide additional informa- tion. Urine cultures to identify the infecting germs will be repeated frequently until the problem is corrected.

ECMO is used most often in new- borns and young children, but it also can be used as a last resort for adults whose heart or lungs are failing. Purpose In newborns, ECMO is used to support or replace an infant\u2019s undeveloped or failing lungs by providing oxy- gen and removing carbon dioxide waste products so the lungs can rest. Infants who need ECMO may include those with: \u2022 meconium aspiration syndrome (breathing in of a new- born\u2019s first stool by a fetus or newborn, which can block air passages and interfere with lung expansion) \u2022 persistent pulmonary hypertension (a disorder in which the blood pressure in the arteries supplying the lungs is abnormally high) \u2022 respiratory distress syndrome (a lung disorder usually of premature infants that causes increasing difficulty in breathing, leading to a life-threatening deficiency of oxygen in the blood) \u2022 congenital diaphragmatic hernia (the profusion of part of the stomach through an opening in the diaphragm). \u2022 pneumonia \u2022 blood poisoning ECMO is also used to support a child or adult patient\u2019s damaged, infected, or failing lungs for a few hours to allow treatment or healing. It is effective for those patients with severe, but reversible, heart or lung problems who haven\u2019t responded to treatment with a ventilator, drugs, or extra oxygen. Adults and children who need ECMO usually have one of these problems: \u2022 heart failure \u2022 pneumonia \u2022 respiratory failure caused by trauma or severe infec- tion The ECMO procedure can help a patient\u2019s lungs and heart rest and recover, but it will not cure the underlying disease. Any patient who requires ECMO is seriously ill and will likely die without the treatment. Because there is some risk involved, this method is used only when other means of support have failed. Precautions Typically, ECMO patients have daily chest x rays and blood work, and constant vital sign monitoring. They are usually placed on a special rotating bed that is designed to decrease pressure on the skin and help move secretions from the lungs. After the patient is stable on ECMO, the breathing machine settings will be lowered to \u201crest\u201d settings, which allows the lungs to rest without the risk of too much oxy- gen or pressure from the ventilator. Description There are two types of ECMO: Venoarterial (V-A) ECMO supports the heart and lungs, and is used for patients with blood pressure or heart functioning prob- lems in addition to respiratory problems. Venovenous (V- V) ECMO supports the lungs only. V-A ECMO requires the insertion of two tubes, one in the jugular and one in the carotid artery. In the V-V ECMO procedure, the surgeon places a plastic tube into the jugular vein through a small incision in the neck. Once in place, the tubes are connected to the ECMO circuit, and then the machine is turned on. The patient\u2019s blood flows out through the tube and may look very dark because it contains very little oxygen. A pump pushes the blood through an artificial membrane lung, where oxygen is added and carbon dioxide is removed.

Grant Electroconvulsive therapy Definition Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat- ment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefully controlled amount of electricity is introduced into the brain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction with anesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces a mild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in the treatment of severe depression, and provides the most rapid relief currently available for this illness. Purpose The purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses such as severe depression, mania, and schizophrenia. ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement because they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat or drink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, or present some other danger to themselves. Antidepressant medications, while effective in many cases, may take two to six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychotic medications used to treat mania and schizophrenia have many uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side effects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel- op allergiesand therefore are unable to take their medicine. Precautions The most common risks associated with ECT are disturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bones occur very rarely. Description The treatment of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy was introduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerletti and Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con- vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since, according to their obervations, this disease rarely occurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. They concluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi- cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illness could be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari- ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their patients died or suffered severe injuries because the strength of the convulsions could not be well controlled. Electroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro- versial of all procedures used to treat mental illness. When it was first introduced, many people were fright- ened simply because it was called \u201cshock treatment.\u201d Many assumed the procedure would be painful, others thought it was a form of electrocution, and still others believed it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately, unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and movies added to these fears. Indeed, in those early years, patients and families were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this or other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result, patients had violent seizures, and even though they did not remember them, the procedure itself was frightening. The way these treatments are given today is very dif- ferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently, ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen, suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to deal with the rare emergency. The treatment is carried out as follows: approxi- mately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time, the patient may receive an injection of a medication (such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas- ing too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient is placed on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat- ically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon- itor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol- lowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes all of the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, and the risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated. When the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air- way is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec- trodes are placed on the sides of the head in the temple areas. An electric current is passed through the brain by means of a machine specifically designed for this pur- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1149 Electroconvulsive therapy",

In the first stage of the seizure (tonic phase), the muscles in the body that have not been para- lyzed by medication contract for a period of five to 15 seconds. This is followed by the second stage (clonic phase) that is characterized by twitching movements, usually visible only in the toes or in a non-paralyzed arm or leg. These are caused by alternating contraction and relaxation of these same muscles. This stage lasts approximately 10\u201360 seconds. The entire procedure, from beginning to end, lasts about 30 minutes. The total number of treatments a patient will receive depends upon many factors such as age, diagnosis, the history of illness, family support, and response to thera- py. Patients with depression, for example, usually require six to 12 treatments. Treatments are usually administered every other day, three times a week. The electrodes may be placed on both sides of the head (bilateral) or one side (unilateral). While bilateral ECT appears to be somewhat more effective, unilateral ECT is preferred for individuals who experience pro- longed confusion or forgetfulness following treatment. Many doctors begin treatment with unilateral ECT, then change to bilateral if the patient is not improving. Post-treatment confusion and forgetfulness are com- mon, though disturbing symptoms associated with ECT. Doctors and nurses must be patient and supportive by providing patients with factual information about recov- ery. Elderly patients, for example, may become increas- ingly confused and forgetful as the treatments continue. These symptoms usually subside with time, but a small minority of patients state that they have never fully recovered from these effects. With the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950s, the use of ECT became less frequent. These new medications provided relief for untold thousands of patients who suffered greatly from their illness. However, there are a number of side effects associated with these drugs, some of which are irreversible. Another drawback is that some medications do not produce a therapeutic effect for two to six weeks. During this time the patient may present a danger to himself or oth- ers. In addition, there are patients who do not respond to medicine or who have severe allergic reactions. For these individuals, ECT may be the only treatment that will help. Preparation Patients and relatives are prepared for ECT by being shown video tapes that explain both the procedure and the risks involved. The physician then answers any questions these individuals may have, and the patient is asked to sign an \u201cInformed Consent Form.\u201d This gives the doctor and the hospital permission to administer the treatment. Once the form is signed, the doctor performs a com- plete physical examination , and orders a number of tests that can help identify any potential problem. These tests may include a chest x ray , an electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis , spinal x ray, brain wave (EEG), and complete blood count (CBC). Some medications, such as lithium and a type of anti- depressant known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , should be discontinued for some time before treatment. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for at least eight hours prior to the procedure in order to reduce the possi- bility of vomiting and choking. Aftercare After the treatment, patients are moved to a recovery area. Vital signs are recorded every five minutes until the patient is fully awake, which may take 15\u201330 minutes. Some initial confusion may be present but usually disap- pears in a matter of minutes. There may be complaints of headache, muscle pain, or back pain. Such discomfort is quickly relieved by mild medications such as aspirin. Risks Advanced medical technology has substantially reduced the complications associated with ECT. These include slow heart beat (bradycardia), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), memory loss, and confusion. Persons at high risk for ECT include those with recent heart attack, uncontrolled blood pressure, brain tumors, and previous spinal injuries.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIS) such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system. Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine (found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to avoid potentially serious hypertensive side effects. Heterocyclics include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tra- zodone (Desyrel). Bupropion should not be prescribed to patients with a seizure disorder. Side effects of the drug may include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, low blood pressure, and insomnia. Because trazodone has a sedative effect, it is useful in treating depressed patients with insom- nia. Other possible side effects of trazodone include dry mouth, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and headache. Psychosocial therapy Psychotherapy explores an individual\u2019s life to bring to light possible contributing causes of the present depression. During treatment, the therapist helps the patient to become self-aware of his or her thinking pat- terns and how they came to be. There are several differ- ent subtypes of psychotherapy, but all have the common goal of helping the patient develop healthy problem solv- ing and coping skills. Cognitive-behavioral therapy assumes that the patient\u2019s faulty thinking is causing the current depression and focuses on changing the depressed patient\u2019s thought patterns and perceptions. The therapist helps the patient identify negative or distorted thought patterns and the emotions and behavior that accompany them, and then retrains the depressed individual to recognize the think- ing and react differently to it. Electroconvulsant therapy ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy , is usually employed after all therapy and pharmaceutical treatment options have been explored. However, it is sometimes used early in treatment when severe depression is present and the patient refuses oral medication, or when the patient is becoming dehydrated, extremely suicidal, or psychotic. The treatment consists of a series of electrical pulses that move into the brain through electrodes on the patient\u2019s head. ECT is given under general anesthesia and patients are administered a muscle relaxant to pre- vent convulsions. Although the exact mechanisms behind the success of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed that the electrical current modifies the electrochemical processes of the brain, consequently relieving depres- sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confusion are possible side effects immediately following an ECT procedure. Memory loss, typically transient, has also been reported in ECT patients. Alternative treatment St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum ) is used throughout Europe to treat depressive symptoms. Unlike traditional prescription antidepressants, this herbal anti- depressant has few reported side effects. Some users may experience high blood pressure, headaches, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting.

Barstow, RN Electrocution see Electric shock injuries Electroencephalography Definition Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a neurological test that uses an electronic monitoring device to measure and record electrical activity in the brain. Purpose The EEG is a key tool in the diagnosis and manage- ment of epilepsy and other seizure disorders. It is also used to assist in the diagnosis of brain damage and disease (e.g., stroke, tumors, encephalitis), mental retardation, sleep disorders, degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s dis- ease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and certain mental disor- ders (e.g.,alcoholism, schizophrenia, autism). An EEG may also be used to monitor brain activity during surgery and to determine brain death. Precautions Electroencephalography should be administered and interpreted by a trained medical professional only. Data from an EEG is only one element of a complete medical and/or psychological patient assessment, and should never be used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis. Description Before the EEG begins, a nurse or technician attach- es approximately 16\u201320 electrodes to the patient\u2019s scalp with a conductive, washable paste. Depending on the purpose for the EEG, implantable or invasive electrodes are occasionally used. Implantable electrodes include sphenoidal electrodes, which are fine wires inserted under the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone; and depth elec- trodes, which are surgically-implanted into the brain. The EEG electrodes are painless, and are used to mea- sure the electrical activity in various regions of the brain. For the test, the patient lies on a bed, padded table, or comfortable chair and is asked to relax and remain still during the EEG testing period. An EEG usually takes no more than one hour. During the test procedure, the patient may be asked to breathe slowly or quickly; visual stimuli such as flashing lights or a patterned board may be used to stimulate certain types of brain activity. Throughout the procedure, the electroencephalograph machine makes a continuous graphic record of the patient\u2019s brain activity, or brainwaves, on a long strip of recording paper or on a computer screen. This graphic record is called an electroencephalogram. The sleep EEG uses the same equipment and proce- dures as a regular EEG. Patients undergoing a sleep EEG are encouraged to fall asleep completely rather than just relax. They are typically provided a bed and a quiet room conducive to sleep. A sleep EEG lasts up to three hours. In an ambulatory EEG, patients are hooked up to a portable cassette recorder. They then go about their nor- mal activities, and take their normal rest and sleep for a period of up to 24 hours. During this period, the patient and patient\u2019s family record any symptoms or abnormal behaviors, which can later be correlated with the EEG to see if they represent seizures. Many insurance plans provide reimbursement for EEG testing. Costs for an EEG range from $100 to more than $500, depending on the purpose and type of test (i.e., asleep or awake, and invasive or non-invasive elec- trodes).

It is used routinely in physical examinations and for monitoring the patient\u2019s condition during and after surgery, as well as during intensive care. It is the basic measurement used for tests such as exercise tolerance. It is used to evaluate causes of symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Precautions No special precautions are required. Description The patient disrobes from the waist up, and elec- trodes (tiny wires in adhesive pads) are applied to specif- ic sites on the arms, legs, and chest. When attached, the electrodes are called leads; three to 12 leads may be employed. Muscle movement may interfere with the recording, which lasts for several beats of the heart. In cases where rhythm disturbances are suspected to be infrequent, the patient may wear a small Holter monitor in order to record continuously over a 24-hour period; this is known as ambulatory monitoring. Preparation The skin is cleaned to obtain good electrical contact at the electrode positions. Aftercare To avoid skin irritation from the salty gel used to obtain good electrical contact, the skin should be thor- oughly cleaned after removal of the electrodes. Risks No complications from this procedure have been observed. Normal results When the heart is operating normally, each part con- tracts in a specific order.

Electrophysiology study of the heart Definition An electrophysiology (EP) study of the heart is a nonsurgical analysis of the electrical conduction system (normal or abnormal) of the heart. The test employs car- diac catheters and sophisticated computers to generate electrocardiogram (EKG) tracings and electrical mea- surements with exquisite precision from within the heart chambers. The EP study can be performed solely for diagnostic purposes. It also is performed to pinpoint the exact loca- tion of electrical signals (cardiac mapping) in conjunction with a therapeutic procedure called catheter ablation. The test is simple, not painful, and performed in a special laboratory under controlled clinical circum- stances by cardiologists and nurses who subspecialize in electrophysiology. Purpose A cardiologist may recommend an EP study when the standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress test, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide enough information to evaluate an abnormal heart rhythm, called an arrhythmia. An EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a suspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptoms of an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detected from other tests. The purpose and great value of an EP study is that it offers more detailed information to the doctor about the electrical activity in the heart than the aforementioned noninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directly on heart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to determine the specific location of an arrhythmia and, oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. This corrective treatment is permanent and considered a cure, and, in many cases, the patient may not need to take heart medications. EP studies may be helpful in assessing: \u2022 certain tachycardias or bradycardias of unknown cause. \u2022 patients who have been resuscitated after experiencing sudden cardiac death. \u2022 various symptoms of unknown cause, such as chest pain, shortness of breath , fatigue, or syncope (dizzi- ness/fainting). \u2022 response to anti-arrhythmic therapy. Precautions Pregnant patients should not undergo an EP study because of exposure to radiation during the study, which may be harmful to the growing baby. Patients who have coronary artery disease may need to have that treated before having an EP study. Description The rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is essentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulses traveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham- bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which are specialized cells situated in the top right chamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SA node, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generates the impulses, which travel through specific pathways throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node. The A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses to more specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottom chambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathways become damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path- ways exist, the heart\u2019s rhythm may be altered (perhaps too slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriously affect the heart\u2019s pumping ability. The patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP lab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets are placed over him or her. A minimum of two catheters are inserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groin area. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the number of catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heart may vary. For certain tachycardias, two more catheters may be inserted in the left groin and one in the internal jugular (neck) vein or in the subclavian (below the clavi- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1163 Electrophysiology study of the heart",

With the help of fluoroscopy (x rays on a television screen), all the catheters are guided to several specific locations in the heart. Typically, four to 10 electrodes are located on the end of the catheters, which have the ability to send electrical signals to stimulate the heart (called pacing) and to receive electrical signals from the heart\u2014 but not at the same time (just as a walkie-talkie cannot send and receive messages at the same time). First, the electrodes are positioned to receive signals from inside the heart chambers. This allows the doctor to measure how fast the electrical impulses travel currently in the patient\u2019s heart. These measurements are called the patient\u2019s baseline measurements. Next, the electrodes are positioned to pace: The EP team actually tries to induce (sometimes in combination with various heart drugs) the arrhythmia that the patient has previously experienced so the team can observe it in a controlled environment, compare it to the patient\u2019s clinical or spontaneous arrhythmia, and decide how to treat it. Once the arrhythmia is induced and the team deter- mines it can be treated with catheter ablation, cardiac mapping is performed to locate precisely the origin and route of the abnormal pathway. When this is accom- plished, the ablating electrode catheter is positioned directly against the abnormal pathway, and high radio- frequency energy is delivered through the electrode to destroy (burn) the tissue in this area.

Grant Electroconvulsive therapy Definition Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical treat- ment for severe mental illness in which a small, carefully controlled amount of electricity is introduced into the brain. This electrical stimulation, used in conjunction with anesthesia and muscle relaxant medications, produces a mild generalized seizure or convulsion. While used to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, it is most effective in the treatment of severe depression, and provides the most rapid relief currently available for this illness. Purpose The purpose of electroconvulsive therapy is to provide relief from the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses such as severe depression, mania, and schizophrenia. ECT is indicated when patients need rapid improvement because they are suicidal, self-injurious, refuse to eat or drink, cannot or will not take medication as prescribed, or present some other danger to themselves. Antidepressant medications, while effective in many cases, may take two to six weeks to produce a therapeutic effect. Antipsychotic medications used to treat mania and schizophrenia have many uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous side effects, limiting their use. In addition, some patients devel- op allergiesand therefore are unable to take their medicine. Precautions The most common risks associated with ECT are disturbances in heart rhythm. Broken or dislocated bones occur very rarely. Description The treatment of severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia, using electroconvulsive therapy was introduced in 1938 by two Italian doctors named Cerletti and Bini. In those days many doctors believed that con- vulsions were incompatible with schizophrenia since, according to their obervations, this disease rarely occurred in individuals suffering from epilepsy. They concluded, therefore, that if convulsions could be artifi- cally produced in patients with schizophrenia, the illness could be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari- ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their patients died or suffered severe injuries because the strength of the convulsions could not be well controlled. Electroconvulsive therapy is among the most contro- versial of all procedures used to treat mental illness. When it was first introduced, many people were fright- ened simply because it was called \u201cshock treatment.\u201d Many assumed the procedure would be painful, others thought it was a form of electrocution, and still others believed it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately, unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and movies added to these fears. Indeed, in those early years, patients and families were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this or other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result, patients had violent seizures, and even though they did not remember them, the procedure itself was frightening. The way these treatments are given today is very dif- ferent from the procedures used in the past. Currently, ECT is offered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis. Hospitals have specially equipped rooms with oxygen, suction, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to deal with the rare emergency. The treatment is carried out as follows: approxi- mately 30 minutes before the scheduled treatment time, the patient may receive an injection of a medication (such as atropine) that keeps the pulse rate from decreas- ing too much during the convulsion. Next, the patient is placed on a cot and hooked up to a machine that automat- ically takes and displays vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) on a television-like mon- itor. A mild anesthetic is then injected into a vein, fol- lowed by a medication (such a Anectine) that relaxes all of the muscles in the body so that the seizure is mild, and the risk of broken bones is virtually eliminated. When the patient is both relaxed and asleep, an air- way is placed in the mouth to aid with breathing. Elec- trodes are placed on the sides of the head in the temple areas.

Richard Robinson Electronic fetal monitoring Definition Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is a method for examining the condition of a baby in the uterus by noting any unusual changes in its heart rate. Electronic fetal moni- toring is performed late in pregnancyor continuously dur- ing labor to ensure normal delivery of a healthy baby. EFM can be utilized either externally or internally in the womb. Purpose The heart rate of a fetus undergoes constant adjust- ment as it responds to its environment and other stimuli. The fetal monitor records an unborn baby\u2019s heart rate and graphs it on a piece of paper. Electronic fetal monitoring is usually advised for high-risk pregnancies, when the baby is in danger of distress. Specific reasons for EFM include: babies in a breech position, premature labor , and induced labor, among others. When electronic fetal monitoring was originally introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, the hope was that it would help physicians diagnose fetal hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, in time to prevent damage to the baby. This lack of oxygen, also known as perinatal asphyxia or birth asphyxia, is an important cause of stillbirth and newborn deaths. It occurs when there are less than normal amounts of oxygen delivered to the body or an organ and there is build-up of carbon dioxide in the body or tissue. A lack of blood flow to an organ can cause asphyxia. Perinatal asphyxia can occur a long time before birth, shortly before birth, during delivery, or after birth. If the interruption to the supply of oxygen is short, the baby may recover without any damage. If the time is longer, there may be some injury that is reversible. If the time period without oxygen is very long, there may be perma- nent injury to one or more organs of the body. It is impor- tant, to detect any signs of asphyxia as soon as possible. One of the signs is an abnormal heart rate and rhythm in the unborn baby, which can be detected by electronic fetal monitoring. The fetal monitor is a more intricate version of the machine that a health care provider uses to listen to a baby\u2019s heartbeat. The monitor that is used during prenatal visits just picks up the sound of the baby\u2019s heart beating. The fetal monitor also keeps a continuous paper record of the heart rate. In addition, the fetal monitor can record uterine con- tractions on the lower part of the paper strip. This helps the doctor or midwife determine how a baby is handling the stress of contractions. The normal pattern is for the baby\u2019s heartbeat to drop slightly during a contraction and then go back to normal after the contraction is over. EFM looks for any changes from this normal pattern, particularly if there is a drastic drop in the baby\u2019s heart beat or if the heart rate does not recover immediately after a contraction. Because it is an indirect test, it is not perfect. When an adult complains to a provider about not feeling well, checking the heart rate is only one of many things that the doctor will do. With an unborn baby, however, check- ing the heart rate is basically the only thing that a doctor or midwife can do. Fetal monitoring can be helpful in a variety of differ- ent situations. During pregnancy, fetal monitoring can be used as a part of antepartum testing .

          "content": "triggered by an electrical impulse. These electrical impulses travel through specialized cells that form a con- duction system. Following this pathway ensures that con- tractions will occur in a coordinated manner. When the presence of all waves is observed in the electrocardiogram and these waves follow the order defined alphabetically, the heart is said to show a normal sinus rhythm, and impulses may be assumed to be fol- lowing the regular conduction pathway. The heart is described as showing arrhythmia or dys- rhythmia when time intervals between waves, the order, or the number of waves do not fit this pattern. Other fea- tures that may be altered include the direction of wave deflection and wave widths. In the normal heart, electrical impulses\u2014at a rate of 60\u2013100 times per minute\u2014originate in the sinus node. The sinus node is located in the first chamber, known as the right atrium, where blood re-enters the heart. After traveling down to the junction between the upper and lower chambers, the signal stimulates the atrioventricular node. From here, after a delay, it passes by specialized routes through the lower chambers or ventricles. In many disease states, the passage of the electrical impulse can be interrupted in a variety of ways, causing the heart to perform less efficiently. Abnormal results Special training is required for interpretation of the electrocardiogram. To summarize the features used in inter- pretations in the simplest manner, the P wave of the electro- cardiogram is associated with the contraction of the atria. The QRS series of waves, or QRS complex, is associated with ventricular contraction, with the T wave coming after the contraction. Finally, the P-Q or P-R interval gives a value for the time taken for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria to the ventricle (normally less than 0.2 sec). The cause of dysrhythmia is ectopic beats. Ectopic beats are premature heart beats that arise from a site other than the sinus node\u2014commonly from the atria, atrioventricular node, or the ventricle. When these dys- rhythmias are only occasional, they may produce no symptoms, or a feeling of the heart turning over or \u201cflip- flopping\u201d may be experienced. These occasional dys- rhythmias are common in healthy people, but they also can be an indication of heart disease. The varied sources of dysrhythmias provide a wide range of alterations in the form of the electrocardiogram. Ectopic beats that start in the ventricle display an abnor- mal QRS complex. This can indicate disease associated with insufficient blood supply to the muscle (myocardial ischemia). Multiple ectopic sites lead to rapid and unco- ordinated contractions of the atria or ventricles. This con- dition is known as fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, P waves are absent, and the QRS complex appears at errat- ic intervals, or \u201cirregularly irregular.\u201d When the atrial impulse fails to reach the ventricle, a condition known as heart block results. If this is partial, the P-R interval (the time for the impulse to reach the ven- tricle) is prolonged. If complete, the ventricles beat inde- pendently of the atria at about 40 beats per minute, and the QRS complex is mostly dissociated from the P wave. Resources BOOKS Atwood, Sandra, et al.

Most often referred to as the purple coneflower, this hardy plant also known as Sampson root, Missouri snakeroot, and rudbeckia. The prominent, bristly seed head inspired the generic name of the plant, taken from the Greek word echinos meaning hedgehog. Description Echinacea is a North American prairie native, abun- dant in the Midwest, and cultivated widely in ornamental and medicinal gardens. The purple-pink rays of the blos- som droop downward from a brassy hued center cone composed of many small, tubular florets. The conspicu- ous flowers bloom singly on stout, prickly stems from mid-summer to autumn. Flower heads may grow to 4 in (10.16 cm) across. The dark green leaves are opposite, entire, lanceolate, toothed, and hairy with three promi- nent veins. The narrow upper leaves are attached to the stem with stalks. The lower leaves are longer, emerging from the stem without a leaf stalk, and growing to 8 in (20.32 cm) in length. The plant develops deep, slender, black roots. Echinacea propagates easily from seed or by root cuttings. However, due to its increasing popularity as an herbal supplement, echinacea is numbered among the 19 medicinal plants considered at risk by the Vermont nonprofit organization, United Plant Savers. Purpose Three species of echinacea are useful medicinally: Echinacea augustifolia, Echinacea purpurea , and Echi- nacea pallida . The entire plant has numerous medicinal properties that act synergistically to good effect. Echi- nacea is most often used to boost the immune system and fight infection. Research has shown that echinacea increases production of interferon in the body. It is anti- septic and antimicrobial, with properties that act to increase the number of white blood cells available to destroy bacteria and slow the spread of infection. As a depurative, the herbal extract cleanses and purifies the bloodstream, and has been used effectively to treat boils. Echinacea is vulnerary, promoting wound healing through the action of a chemical substance in the root known as caffeic acid glycoside. As an alterative and an immuno- modulator, echinacea acts gradually to promote beneficial change in the entire system. It has also been used to treat urinary infection and Candida albicans infections. Echi- nacea is a febrifuge, useful in reducing fevers. It is also useful in the treatment of hemorrhoids. A tincture, or a strong decoction of echinacea serves as an effective mouthwash for the treatment of pyorrhea and gingivitis. Native American plains Indians relied on echinacea as an all-purpose antiseptic. The Sioux tribe valued the root as a remedy for snake bite, the Cheyenne tribe chewed the root to quench thirst, and another tribe washed their hands in a decoction of echinacea to increase their tolerance of heat. European settlers learned of the North American herb\u2019s many uses, and soon numerous echinacea-based remedies were commercially available from pharmaceutical companies in the United States. Echinacea was a popular remedy in the United States through the 1930s. It was among many medicinal herbs listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, the official Unit- ed States government listing of pharmaceutical raw materials and recipes. The herb fell out of popular use in the United States with the availability of antibiotics . In West Germany, over 200 preparations are made from the species E. purpurea. Commercially prepared salves, tinc- tures, teas, and extracts are marketed using standardized extracts. Echinacea is regaining its status in the United States as a household medicine-chest staple in many homes. It is one of the best-selling herbal supplements in United States health food stores. Clinical studies have found that the entire plant pos- sesses medicinal properties with varying levels of effec- tiveness. Echinacea is of particular benefit in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. Some research has shown that echinacea activates the macrophages that destroy cancer cells and pathogens.

Common symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: \u2022 labored breathing, sometimes accompanied by chest pain \u2022 a rapid pulse \u2022a cough that may produce sputum \u2022 a low-grade fever \u2022 fluid build-up in the lungs Less common symptoms include: \u2022 coughing up blood \u2022 pain caused by movement or breathing \u2022 leg swelling \u2022 bluish skin \u2022 fainting \u2022 swollen neck veins Symptoms of an arterial embolism include: \u2022 severe pain in the area of the embolism \u2022 pale, bluish cool skin \u2022 numbness \u2022 tingling \u2022 muscular weakness or paralysis Diagnosis An embolism can be diagnosed through the patient\u2019s history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. For arterial emboli, cardiac ultrasound and/or arteriography are ordered. For a pulmonary embolism, a chest x ray, lung scan, pulmonary angiography , electrocardiography , arterial blood gas measurements, and venography or venous ultrasound could be ordered. Diagnosing an arterial embolism Ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the heart, organs, or arteries. The technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer then presses it against the patient\u2019s body. The ultrasound\u2019s sound waves arteries are converted into an image that can be displayed on a moni- tor. Performed in an outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test takes 30\u201360 minutes. An arteriogram is an x ray in which a contrast medi- um is injected to make the arteries visible on the x ray. It can be performed in a radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or diagnostic center of a hospital. Diagnosing a pulmonary embolism A chest x ray can show fluid build-up and detect other respiratory diseases. The perfusion lung scan shows poor flow of blood in areas beyond blocked arteries. The patient inhales a small amount of radiopharmaceutical and pictures of airflow into the lungs are taken with a gamma camera. Then a different radiopharmaceutical is injected into an arm vein and lung blood flow is scanned. A normal result essentially rules out a pulmonary embolism. A lung scan can be performed in a hospital or an outpatient facility and takes about 45 minutes. Pulmonary angiography is the most reliable test for diagnosing a pulmonary embolism but it is not used often because it is expensive, invasive, and not readily available in most hospitals. Pulmonary angiography is a radiographic test which involves injection of a radio contrast agent to show the pulmonary arteries. A cinematic camera records the blood flow through the patient, who lies on a table. Pul- monary angiography is usually performed in a hospital\u2019s radiology medicine department and takes 30\u201360 minutes. An electrocardiograph shows the heart\u2019s electrical activity and helps distinguish a pulmonary embolism from a heart attack. Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient\u2019s chest, arms, and legs. Impulses of the heart\u2019s activity are traced on paper. The test takes about 10 minutes. Arterial blood gas measurements are sometimes helpful but, alone, they are not diagnostic for pulmonary embolism. Blood is taken from an artery instead of a vein, usually in the wrist. Venography is used to look for the most likely source of a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis. It is very accurate, but it is not used often, because it is painful, expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high dose of radiation, and can cause complications.

Purpose The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells from the infected person. Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies poten- tial candidates for tumor removal and repairs intraopera- tively (during the operation procedure). Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous system cancers.

And, criterion for diagnosis require significant impair- ment in social or vocational functioning. Dissociative amnesia Dissociative amnesia is a disorder in which the distinctive feature is the patient\u2019s inability to remem- ber important personal information to a degree that cannot be explained by normal forgetfulness. In many cases, it is a reaction to a traumatic accident or wit- nessing a violent crime. Patients with dissociative amnesia may develop depersonalization or trance states as part of the disorder, but they do not experi- ence a change in identity. Dissociative fugue Dissociative fugue is a disorder in which a person temporarily loses his or her sense of personal identity and travels to another location where he or she may assume a new identity. Again, this condition usually follows a major stressor or trauma. Apart from inability to recall their past or personal information, patients with dissocia- tive fugue do not behave strangely or appear disturbed to others. Cases of dissociative fugue are more common in wartime or in communities disrupted by a natural disaster. Depersonalization disorder Depersonalization disorder is a disturbance in which the patient\u2019s primary symptom is a sense of detachment from the self. Depersonalization as a symp- tom (not as a disorder) is quite common in college-age populations. It is often associated with sleep deprivation or \u201crecreational\u201d drug use. It may be accompanied by \u201cderealization\u201d (where objects in an environment appear altered). Patients sometimes describe depersonalization as feeling like a robot or watching themselves from the outside. Depersonalization disorder may also involve feelings of numbness or loss of emotional \u201caliveness.\u201d Dissociative identity disorder (DID) Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the newer name for multiple personality disorder (MPD). DID is considered the most severe dissociative disorder and involves all of the major dissociative symptoms. Dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) DDNOS is a diagnostic category ascribed to patients with dissociative symptoms that do not meet the full cri- teria for a specific dissociative disorder. Causes and symptoms The moderate to severe dissociation that occurs in patients with dissociative disorders is understood to result from a set of causes: \u2022 an innate ability to dissociate easily \u2022 repeated episodes of severe physical or sexual abuse in childhood \u2022 the lack of a supportive or comforting person to coun- teract abusive relative(s) \u2022 the influence of other relatives with dissociative symp- toms or disorders The relationship of dissociative disorders to child- hood abuse has led to intense controversy and lawsuits concerning the accuracy of childhood memories. The brain\u2019s storage, retrieval, and interpretation of memories are still not fully understood. Controversy also exists regarding how much individuals presenting dissociative disorders have been influenced by books and movies to describe a certain set of symptoms (scripting). The major dissociative symptoms are: Amnesia Amnesia in a dissociative disorder is marked by gaps in a patient\u2019s memory for long periods of time or for traumatic events. Doctors can distinguish this type of amnesia from loss of memory caused by head injuries or drug intoxication, because the amnesia is \u201cspotty\u201d and related to highly charged events and feelings. Depersonalization Depersonalization is a dissociative symptom in which the patient feels that his or her body is unreal, is changing, or is dissolving. Some patients experience depersonalization as being outside their bodies or watch- ing a movie of themselves. Derealization Derealization is a dissociative symptom in which the external environment is perceived as unreal. The patient may see walls, buildings, or other objects as changing in shape, size, or color. In some cases, the patient may feel that other persons are machines or robots, though the patient is able to acknowledge the unreality of this feeling. Identity disturbances Patients with dissociative fugue, DDNOS, or DID often experience confusion about their identities or even assume new identities.

When a stressful or traumatic experience triggers the reemergence of these dissociated parts, the patient may act differently, answer to a different name, or appear confused by his or her surroundings. Diagnosis When a doctor is evaluating a patient with dissocia- tive symptoms, he or she will first rule out physical con- ditions that sometimes produce amnesia, depersonaliza- tion, or derealization. These physical conditions include epilepsy, head injuries, brain disease, side effects of med- ications, substance abuse, intoxication, AIDS, dementia complex, or recent periods of extreme physical stress and sleeplessness. In some cases, the doctor may give the patient an electroencephalogram (EEG) to exclude epilepsy or other seizure disorders. If the patient appears to be physically normal, the doctor will rule out psychotic disturbances, including schizophrenia . In addition, doctors can use some psy- chological tests to narrow the diagnosis. One is a screen- er, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). If the patient has a high score on this test, he or she can be eval- uated further with the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D). It is also pos- sible for doctors to measure a patient\u2019s hypnotizability as part of a diagnostic evaluation. Treatment Treatment of the dissociative disorders often com- bines several methods. Psychotherapy Patients with dissociative disorders often require treatment by a therapist with some specialized under- standing of dissociation. This background is particularly important if the patient\u2019s symptoms include identity problems. Many patients with dissociative disorders are helped by group as well as individual treatment. Medications Some doctors will prescribe tranquilizers or antide- pressants for the anxiety and/or depression that often accompany dissociative disorders. Patients with dissocia- tive disorders are, however, at risk for abusing or becom- ing dependent on medications. As of 2001, there is no drug that can reliably counteract dissociation itself. Hypnosis Hypnosis is frequently recommended as a method of treatment for dissociative disorders, partly because hyp- KEY TERMS Amnesia \u2014A general medical term for loss of memory that is not due to ordinary forgetfulness. Amnesia can be caused by head injuries, brain disease, or epilepsy, as well as by dissociation. Depersonalization \u2014A dissociative symptom in which the patient feels that his or her body is unre- al, is changing, or is dissolving. Derealization \u2014A dissociative symptom in which the external environment is perceived as unreal. Dissociation \u2014A psychological mechanism that allows the mind to split off traumatic memories or disturbing ideas from conscious awareness. Fugue\u2014A dissociative experience during which a person travels away from home, has amnesia for their past, and may be confused about their identi- ty but otherwise appear normal. Hypnosis\u2014The means by which a state of extreme relaxation and suggestibility is induced: used to treat amnesia and identity disturbances that occur in dissociative disorders.

Trauma\u2014A disastrous or life-threatening event that can cause severe emotional distress, includ- ing dissociative symptoms and disorders. nosis is related to the process of dissociation. Hypnosis may help patients recover repressed ideas and memories. Therapists treating patients with DID sometimes use hypnosis in the process of \u201cfusing\u201d the patient\u2019s alternate personalities. Prognosis Prognoses for dissociative disorders vary. Recovery from dissociative fugue is usually rapid. Dissociative amnesia may resolve quickly, but can become a chronic disorder in some patients. Depersonalization disorder, DDNOS, and DID are usually chronic conditions. DID usually requires five or more years of treatment for recovery.

Purpose Diuretics are used to treat the buildup of excess fluid in the body that occurs with some medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, and kid- ney disease. Some diuretics are also prescribed to treat high blood pressure. These drugs act on the kidneys to increase urine output. This reduces the amount of fluid in the bloodstream, which in turn lowers blood pressure. Description There are several types of diuretics, also called water pills: \u2022 Loop diuretics, such as bumetanide (Bumex) and furosemide (Lasix), get their name from the loop- shaped part of the kidneys where they have their effect. \u2022 Thiazide diuretics include such commonly used diuret- ics as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL, Esidrix), chlorothiazide (Diuril), and chlorthalidone (Hygroton). \u2022 Potassium-sparing diuretics prevent the loss of potassi- um, which is a problem with other types of diuretics. Examples of potassium-sparing diuretics are amiloride (Midamor) and triamterene (Dyrenium). In addition, some medicines contain combinations of two diuretics. The brands Dyazide and Maxzide, for example, contain the thiazide diuretic hydrochloroth- iazide with the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene. Some nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines contain diuretics. However, the medicines described here cannot be bought without a physician\u2019s prescrip- tion. They are available in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms. Recommended dosage The recommended dosage depends on the type of diuretic and may be different for different patients. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage, and take the medicine exactly as directed. Precautions Seeing a physician regularly while taking a diuretic is important. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will watch for unwanted side effects. Some people feel unusually tired when they first start taking diuretics. This effect usually becomes less noticeable over time, as the body adjusts to the medicine. Because diuretics increase urine output, people who take this medicine may need to urinate more often, even during the night. Health care professionals can help patients schedule their doses to avoid interfering with their sleep or regular activities. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1088 Diuretics",

Frey Famine fever see Relapsing fever Fanconi\u2019s syndrome Definition Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is a set of kidney malfunctions brought about by a variety of seemingly unrelated disor- ders. Kidney malfunction leads to excessive urine produc- tion and excessive thirst, resulting in deficits of water, cal- cium, potassium, magnesium, and other substances in the body. It often leads to bone disease and stunted growth. Description Normally, kidneys cleanse the blood and keep its salt, water, and acidity in balance, leaving what the body needs in the blood and putting what the body doesn\u2019t need into the urine, which leaves the body. This task is performed in two steps. First, the blood is filtered through a kidney structure with small holes that keep the cells and large molecules in the blood. Second, some of the small molecules in the filtrate, needed by the body, are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. This reabsorption step is defective in Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome. As a consequence, substances that are normally reabsorbed, like glucose, amino acids, small proteins, water, calcium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and phosphate, are lost and the body becomes overly acidic. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is also known as Fanconi syn- drome, renal Fanconi syndrome, Fanconi renaltubular syndrome, and Lignac-de Toni-Debr\u00e9-Fanconi syndrome. Fanconi\u2019s anemia is, however, a totally different disease. Causes and symptoms Causes Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be caused by a variety of genetic defects and by certain environmental assaults. The genetic diseases known to give rise to Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome are cystinosis (the most common cause in children), galactosemia , glycogen storage disease, hereditary fructose intolerance , Lowe syndrome, Wilson disease , tyrosinemia, medullary cystic disease, vitamin D dependency, and familial idiopathic Fan- coni\u2019s syndrome. Environmental assaults that cause Fanconi\u2019s syn- drome include exposure to heavy metals (like cadmium, lead, mercury, platinum, uranium), certain drugs (like outdated tetracycline and gentamicin), other substances (like Lysol, paraquat, toluene, the amino acid lysine taken as a nutritional supplement), and kidney trans- plantation. Symptoms Fanconi\u2019s syndrome symptoms related directly to impaired absorption include excessive urine production and urination; excessive thirst; dehydration ; constipa- tion; anorexia nervosa; vomiting; elevated levels of glu- cose, phosphate, calcium, uric acid, amino acids, and protein (especially beta2-microglobulin and lysozyme) in the urine; elevated levels of chloride and decreased levels of phosphate and calcium in the blood; and excessively acidic blood. The most noticeable indirect consequences of impaired reabsorption are the bone diseases, rickets and osteomalacia. Rickets affects children and is associated with bone deformities, failure to grow, and difficulty walking. If a person acquires Fanconi\u2019s syndrome as an adult, the bone disease is termed osteomalacia and is accompanied by severe bone pain and spontaneous frac- tures. Unlike rickets due to malnutrition, these diseases cannot be reversed with vitamin D. Muscle weakness and occasional paralysis are other indirect consequences of the ineffective reabsorption. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can be made by urine and blood tests. It is also important to find the underlying cause to decide on the best treatment. Other symptoms specific to a particular patient will point to other useful diagnostic tests. For example, high levels of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1290 Fanconi\u2019s syndrome",

          "content": "Description Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feel- ings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical and mental deterioration, they become what are known as depressive disorders. Each year in the United States, depressive disorders affect an estimated 17 million people at an approximate annual direct and indirect cost of $53 billion. One in four women is like- ly to experience an episode of severe depression in her lifetime, with a 10\u201320% lifetime prevalence, com- pared to 5\u201310% for men. The average age a first depressive episode occurs is in the mid-20s, although the disorder strikes all age groups indiscriminately, from children to the elderly. There are two main categories of depressive disor- ders: major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depressive disorder is a moderate to severe episode of depression lasting two or more weeks. Indi- viduals experiencing this major depressive episode may have trouble sleeping, lose interest in activities they once took pleasure in, experience a change in weight, have dif- ficulty concentrating, feel worthless and hopeless, or have a preoccupation with death or suicide. In children, the major depression may appear as irritability. While major depressive episodes may be acute (intense but short-lived), dysthymic disorder is an ongo- ing, chronic depression that lasts two or more years (one or more years in children) and has an average duration of 16 years. The mild to moderate depression of dysthymic disorder may rise and fall in intensity, and those afflicted with the disorder may experience some periods of nor- mal, non-depressed mood of up to two months in length. Its onset is gradual, and dysthymic patients may not be able to pinpoint exactly when they started feeling depressed. Individuals with dysthymic disorder may experience a change in sleeping and eating patterns, low self-esteem, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness. Depression can also occur in bipolar disorder ,a n affective mental illness that causes radical emotional changes and mood swings, from manic highs to depres- sive lows. The majority of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes of mania and depression. Causes and symptoms The causes behind depression are complex and not yet fully understood. While an imbalance of certain neu- rotransmitters\u2014the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cell\u2014 is believed to be key to depression, external factors such as upbringing (more so in dysthymia than major depression) may be as impor- tant. For example, it is speculated that, if an individual is abused and neglected throughout childhood and adoles- cence, a pattern of low self-esteem and negative thinking may emerge. From that, a lifelong pattern of depression may follow. Heredity does seem to play a role in who develops depressive disorders. Individuals with major depression in their immediate family are up to three times more likely to have the disorder themselves. It would seem that biological and genetic factors may make certain individuals pre-disposed or prone to depressive disor- ders, but environmental circumstances may often trig- ger the disorder. External stressors and significant life changes, such as chronic medical problems, death of a loved one, divorce or estrangement, miscarriage , or loss of a job, can also result in a form of depression known as adjust- ment disorder. Although periods of adjustment disorder usually resolve themselves, occasionally they may evolve into a major depressive disorder. Major depressive episode Individuals experiencing a major depressive episode have a depressed mood and/or a diminished interest or pleasure in activities. Children experiencing a major depressive episode may appear or feel irritable rather than depressed. In addition, five or more of the following symptoms will occur on an almost daily basis for a peri- od of at least two weeks: \u2022 Significant change in weight. \u2022 Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleep). \u2022 Psychomotor agitation or retardation. \u2022 Fatigue or loss of energy. \u2022 Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt. \u2022 Diminished ability to think or to concentrate, or indeci- siveness. \u2022 Recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal and/or suicide attempts.

KEY TERMS Articular capsule\u2014An envelope of tissue that sur- rounds a free moving joint, composed of an exter- nal layer of white fibrous tissue and an external synovial membrane that secretes a lubricant into the joint. Description In order to have a clear picture of these disorders, dissociation should first be understood. Dissociation is a mechanism that allows the mind to separate or compart- mentalize certain memories or thoughts from normal consciousness. These split-off mental contents are not erased. They may resurface spontaneously or be trig- gered by objects or events in the person\u2019s environment. Dissociation is a process that occurs along a spec- trum of severity. It does not necessarily mean that a per- son has a dissociative disorder or other mental illness. A mild degree of dissociation occurs with some physical stressors; people who have gone without sleep for a long period of time, have had \u201claughing gas\u201d for dental surgery, or have been in a minor accident often have brief dissociative experiences. Another commonplace example of dissociation is a person becoming involved in a book or movie so completely that the surroundings or the passage of time are not noticed. Another example might be driving on the highway and taking several exits without noticing or remembering. Dissociation is related to hypnosis in that hypnotic trance also involves a tem- porarily altered state of consciousness. Most patients with dissociative disorders are highly hypnotizable. People in other cultures sometimes have dissociative experiences in the course of religious (in certain trance states) or other group activities. These occurrences should not be judged in terms of what is considered \u201cnor- mal\u201d in the United States. Moderate or severe forms of dissociation are caused by such traumatic experiences as childhood abuse, com- bat, criminal attacks, brainwashing in hostage situations, or involvement in a natural or transportation disaster. Patients with acute stress disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or conversion disorder and somatization disorder may develop dissociative symp- toms. Recent studies of trauma indicate that the human brain stores traumatic memories in a different way than normal memories. Traumatic memories are not processed or integrated into a person\u2019s ongoing life in the same fashion as normal memories. Instead they are dissociated, or \u201csplit off,\u201d and may erupt into conscious- ness from time to time without warning. The affected person cannot control or \u201cedit\u201d these memories. Over a period of time, these two sets of memories, the normal and the traumatic, may coexist as parallel sets without being combined or blended. In extreme cases, different sets of dissociated memories may alter subpersonalities of patients with dissociative identity disorder ( multiple personality disorder). The dissociative disorders vary in their severity and the suddenness of onset. It is difficult to give statistics GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 1085 Dissociative disorders",

          "content": "Diagnosis Diagnosis of factitious disorders is usually based on the exclusion of bona fide medical or psychiatric condi- tions, together with a combination of the signs listed ear- lier. In some cases, the diagnosis is made on the basis of records from other hospitals. Treatment Treatment of factitious disorders is usually limited to prompt recognition of the condition and the refusal to give unnecessary medications or to perform unneeded procedures. Factitious disorder patients do not usually remain in the hospital long enough for effective psychi- atric treatment. Some clinicians have tried psychothera- peutic treatment for factitious disorder patients, and there are anecdotal reports that antidepressant or antipsychotic medications are helpful in certain cases. Prognosis Some patients have only one or two episodes of fac- titious disorders; others develop a chronic form that may be lifelong. Successful treatment of the chronic form appears to be rare.

Frey Factor IX deficiency see Hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency see Hemophilia Failure to thrive Definition Failure to thrive (FTT) is used to describe a delay in a child\u2019s growth or development. It is usually applied to infants and children up to two years of age who do not gain or maintain weight as they should. Failure to thrive is not a specific disease, but rather a cluster of symptoms which may come from a variety of sources. Description Shortly after birth most infants loose some weight. After that expected loss, babies should gain weight at a steady and predictable rate. When a baby does not gain weigh as expected, or continues to loose weight, it is not thriving. Failure to thrive may be due to one or more conditions. Organic failure to thrive (OFTT) implies that the organs involved with digestion and absorption of food are malformed or incomplete so the baby cannot digest its food. Non-organic failure to thrive (NOFTT) is the most common cause of FTT and implies the baby is not receiving enough food due to economic factors or parental neglect, or do to psychosocial problems. Causes and symptoms Occasionally, there may be an underlying physical condition that inhibits the baby\u2019s ability to take in, digest, or process food. These defects can occur in the esopha- gus, stomach, small or large intestine, rectum or anus. Usually the defect is an incomplete development of the organ, and it must be surgically corrected. Most physical defects can be detected shortly after birth. GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 21278 Failure to thrive",
