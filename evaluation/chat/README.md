Chat stress testing was attempted but excluded from final evaluation.

Reason:
Conversational datasets primarily measure generator behavior rather than retrieval grounding.
This project focuses on RAG retrieval and grounded answering.

Core evaluation therefore includes:
- Deterministic retrieval evaluation (GALE)
- Semantic answer evaluation (MedQuAD)
- Retrieval ablation experiments

Chat evaluation may be revisited in future work.
